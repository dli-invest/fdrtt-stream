 thanks so much for joining us. You've been in the business back when they were trying to legislate hip-hop and back then. Yeah, if you didn't legislate it now as well. Still, yes. And if you didn't have a contract, you just couldn't break into the business. Once talked about being dependent, it didn't take on. Now we have artists talking about being independent. What happened? Well, I think when Prince said it, nobody really understood what he went. He was way ahead of his time. He's a visionary, he's a visionary musically and he was a visionary on understanding the music business. In fact, he changed his name to the artist formerly known as Prince to get out of his contract. But I think just in general, people thought it's Prince, it's eccentric, not that it was actually a fundamental business reason why. And over time, people really started to understand the value of ownership. They can own your name, they own your likeness. It's in the recording contracts. That's the fundamental understanding of a recording contract is that they own you. And as music has gone, digital distribution and

 talked about the correlation between show business and the music industry. And in it, I was asking about generational wealth. And she talked about, she's like, you realize that even now, she's like, we give away our intellectual property. Yeah. But she's like, we don't even get money from residuals from streaming. No. So this so same thing, you have a lot of people who are talking about going independent and particularly now with the pandemic, we had so many, you know, what they call the gig economy. People going independent. How do you see this coming up, particularly with corporate, you know, you talk about the studio industry, we're talking about corporate

. This whole kind of like move and they're talking about the great resignation towards, no, I need to become the master of my own fate. Yeah, well, so there's a couple of things that I'd like to discuss. So

 is correct. If you don't own, you can't create generational wealth. That's the hope, you have to have an asset to pass down. You have to have an asset that keeps putting off money and putting off value or creating value in order for you to pass it to your siblings and pass it to your next generation. So if you sign a record deal and you give away those rights, I mean, you have nothing to pass down. But if you do give your last

 comment of over there with me or in the final Flexibility hilarious else. And we are talking about things that are really cheery.</div>
<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"> to your siblings and past to your next generation. So if you sign a record deal and you give away those rights, I mean you have nothing to pass down. You have this short term financial gain of the money they gave you to purchase those rights. I think what you've seen is this generational, this sort of shift as generations have evolved where we've gone from the indented servant to slavery, to the employee, to ownership. And I think that's where we are. And just sort of to work in the cycle of value creation is like I don't want to be an employee, I just don't want to be employee anymore. I want to own. Even if you work at a company, you want equity. And if you are creative, you definitely want to retain the value of the intellectual property that you created. So that's just the evolution of the way things have evolved. And that's a good thing because those stories that we all grew up on watching, I don't know if it was the

-heart beats, but whatever tragic story of a creator who created something and then looked up and ended up, they didn't own anything. And their name and their likeness in their work was gone. Are not stories that people want to replicate anymore? These next generation of creators are entrepreneurs. And that's actually sighting for me to go from being in the record business and not understanding as the record executive, actually economics of the business. And I tell a lot of people who are friends of mine that work at record companies, they work there. They don't realize that what they're doing is empowering these companies to take these rights. But as I've evolved as a person, we're able to build this business to help provide these opportunities. You see, it opened up a lot of eyes. And that's why out of all the things that I've done in my career, I'm really most proud of

 helping these independent artists come into their own and own their own stuff? What does it do? Well, the first thing that we're providing is a very simple interface so that you can distribute your music. And, you know, when you go through us, you don't have any issues about ownership. But yours, you retain the rights period, right? So we're first providing that. And that's just distribution. On top of that, we also provide brand services. So we have a company translation that works with some of the greatest brands, the

, and many others. And between the brand side of the business and having the artists, we actually make connections. And we've created a marketplace where the brands and the artists connect. Brands want to be on the front end of understanding culture. These artists are creating culture. So there's obviously a synergy there. And we put that together at scale, whether it be sync. So you're watching a commercial, you're watching an instant feed on social media. The music behind that feed, we're trying to provide all that through our independent artists network. So we're providing artists' distribution plus brand opportunities to underwrite a lot of their, a lot of the things they want to do on going their

 tour, shoot their videos, whatever they want to do, we have brands that are helping underwrite that and putting money in their pocket. So it comes distribution plus opportunity, which no one else in the marketplace even comes close to providing those services. So you talked about distribution plus opportunity. You started off in the record industry. Why did you make the switch into brand-in advertising with translation? That's a long story, but it started with, oddly enough, but I worked on the film

. And the glass is not only sold more, but we were a big reason why the glass was selling, but we got no credit for it at the record company. And I was like, I'd much rather, if we can create culture, and then somebody else monotizes it, I'd much rather be on the side that monotizes it. So it wasn't a coincidence. I knew that music actually creates cultural moments that then creates consumer behavior, contagious consumer behavior, where you got it, I want to buy it, like you got that haircut, I want that haircut, that kind of thing. And I went on the advertising side, the company that did the product placement to put the glasses in the music video and all that, is a company that I first went to, and I left the record business, and I wanted to learn the advertising business, and I learned it. And then in

. They would say, oh, we got to do better. And then they'd just go right back to what they were doing before. And I wrote a lot about this, because unless the brand say, unless you have a certain amount of people that are diverse, or this is your employment requirements, then why would I be in business with you? I want... I hold you to a standard... Unless it affects your money, these agencies, specifically on a creative agency side, they're not going to police themselves.

. We'll be prepared for it. Let's hope we don't need it, but I want to make sure that we have the capacity just in case we do need it. So for that capacity, you're maintaining that. And you plan to maintain that, especially for COVID for some time? So we're maintaining

 times more capacity than the current number of tests that we're running. And we always want to stay at a significantly higher number that we can run versus what we are currently running. So we'll continue to watch the cases. If they go us, we're going to increase our capacity again. You know, what we've learned is we can scale quickly now. So we'll be prepared for whatever we need to do as

 go through the winter and flu season. Good to be able to surge up and down. What about the at home testing part? That's something that at the very beginning, you weren't necessarily very big on. And of course, as you mentioned, innovation, that's something that now we see is a huge market and people are maybe more willing to take tests. Yeah, I think people, if they don't need to go to the doctor's office, they prefer to stay home. And if they don't have to be exposed to other people that are sick or may have COVID, they'd rather stay at home. So we launched

It was, for many reasons, a devastating pandemic, not just for the economy, but for families around the world, and still is. How significant is silver lining worthy advances, though, in diagnostic testing? And what do you think is the best application when we come out, officially out of this pandemic? Now, that's a great question. And I think the world has a better understanding and appreciation of diagnostic testing

 has applications around the world. So we're gonna be bringing more of our innovative test globally as we go into the future. But what we've learned from COVID is that you have to be aggressive, and you have to challenge the big scientific issues. Our scientists are remarkable, and the things that they did for COVID, I don't think anybody would have dreamed they'd be able to do. They were just met with these big challenges, and they found a way to be successful. We now need to do that in cancer, in Alzheimer's disease, and in other areas. So for example, for cancer. Right now, if you wanna see what type of cancer people have, sometimes you have to do surgery, take a piece of the tissue of the organ to understand that. Our hope is in the future, we'll be able to do that with the blood test, and those are the types of things that we're trying to... A biopsy. Instead of a biopsy, we're trying to find a way to do it through a blood test. Extraordinary, how close are we to that? We're still

 really had a really big market when it came to business and employers. How has that shifted with work from home, with the difference in drug testing? We've seen a push for legalized marijuana as well. So how has that all come together in terms of shifting how the business functions? Yeah, that's a great question. And once again, I think COVID had many unintended consequences in the world, whether it be children that had to study from home for a period of time, whether it be parents that no longer wanted to go into the office, leaders had to change. I mean, hopefully I'd become a different leader and I hope a better leader than I was before COVID. But we've learned to have to be more empathetic and to understand that our customers are going through a hard time, that our employees are going through a hard time, that almost everybody around the world is having difficulties based on what's happening in the world

. So I think we've learned a lot about leadership and how to lead through these difficult times. What we've also learned is that you can't be stuck in the way your business ran in the past. You've got to be open to new ideas, to new ways of doing to business. Things that if you would have asked me

, can you actually have these jobs done at home? I would have said no way, we've learned you can. And in certain instances, we've learned we can do things remotely that we weren't able to do before. When it comes to hiring and finding ways to get people employed quickly with our work that we do with employers, we found that a lot of employers are much more distributed now than they were before. So we have to find ways to interact with them as opposed to going on site, but do it through things like at home testing and so forth. Testing when it comes to you guys are heavily involved in drug testing. cannabis

 quest for a roadside cannabis tester. You guys looking at that? At this point, we've not pursued that, but we continue to look at every test where we think we can bring science, innovation, technology to make a difference. So in the future, there may be an opportunity for us, but not at this point. So explain to me this at home market opportunity because it seems like on one hand, there's this push for non-clinical spaces. And by that, I mean the retail pharmacies. And we're retail outlets for people to find your tests or the at home option. And

. And what's stake, you've been a leader in testing so far, what stake do you think you're going to have in this market? Yes. The first thing I say is health equity is important. And it's something we all have to pay attention to. And to be honest, there were things we thought we were doing great when it came to health equity. And through COVID, we learned a lot. So for example, we thought by sending kits to people's homes, if they have COVID, we can make a difference. But there's a lot of people in this country that don't have homes

. So there was no place to send the kits. So therefore, we had to find mobile ways to get kits available to people in other parts of communities. Like you said, people live within

 is a lot for a lot of people. So we continue to look for new innovative ways to ensure that we can bring our testing to everybody across the country in a fair, equitable way. There's still work to be done there. The at-home market's going to be interesting, actually, because I think COVID has changed things a bit. Typically, people said, I want a highly accurate test. But I can get the results in

. But that is fully reimbursed by my managed care plan. For COVID, they said, give me the result as fast as you can. I'll pay whatever it takes in order to get what might not be the most accurate result quickly. I don't think that's going to be the dynamics as we move into the future. So we have to be careful with some of the learnings from COVID and how it may apply to other diseases in the future. So I still think the at-home market has yet to be defined and determined, and there's still a lot more work we have to do. Is the best practical application flew testing at home? So we have flew testing at home. We have a combination test of flew

 test for an at-home test. I think that's a great application, because a doctor can ask their patient to be tested without having to come to the office. But for something like cholesterol or diabetes, the question is, is that a good use of at-home testing? And I'm not quite sure yet. We'll have to see that over time. What about broader costs for this? So on one hand, you have inflation, kind of a big issue. And then on the other hand, you have a lot of focus on health care costs broadly. With this pivot to at-home, you have individual testing shipped out. Is it as cost-effective? Are we looking at, you know, you're able to kind of shift things so it's not increased cost for the patient? So the first thing I'd say is, I think health care costs in this country, and almost every country around the world is a very significant issue that's getting worse by

 than we were prior to COVID, and those costs are increasing. We have to find a way that what we do in health care, including diagnostics, helps reduce cost. The good news is, diagnostics is

 of decisions are made with some type of diagnostic test. I think that we can show through prevention of disease, detection of disease earlier, things like liquid biopsies in the future of a cancer, that over time, we can help reduce health care costs. I think it's incumbent upon all of us in health care to find ways to help

 thing to help in that capacity would be identifying Alzheimer's earlier, and you mentioned that earlier when we talked here. Where is the science on that finding an early biomarker? It doesn't get the attention. Certainly that COVID does. And really that it should. Where is the science on that? I don't know. So it's still evolving, and there's no doubt that Alzheimer's disease is

 the idea of costs increasing generally in healthcare. I know during the pandemic we also saw hospitals and other clinical settings where people weren't coming in to get those tests and so it was really squeezing those healthcare settings. Do you anticipate that you're going to feel a little bit of that squeeze with the reduction in people going to get care? Yeah, I mean the first thing I'd say is that our frontline healthcare workers are the true heroes through the pandemic. I mean the people in our hospitals that came in every day are, there are the heroes of the entire pandemic, our frontline workers. But there's no doubt that hospitals are suffering right now and it's very difficult you see in their

 earnings how difficult the environment is for them. I think as a country we have to do everything can to support what I believe is one of the best healthcare systems in the world. So I do believe it's going to be hard for them. I do think that we're going to have to find ways to support them. There may be some impact on our business but overall our business is very broad, it's very global and you know it's not just hospital-based, it's also physician and other healthcare professional-based. So I think we'll be okay. I do worry about our healthcare system in general. Those hospitals like just about every profession in this country are seeing an employment shortage.

 countries, frankly the trend? Yeah, so we are seeing a shortage of workers across many aspects of our business and I think it's across many aspects of all businesses. So we're doing everything we can to attract, retain and develop the employees that we have. And there's no doubt that the hospitals and other parts of the health system are feeling that same pressure. You do see it in other parts of the world, frankly. And I think it's something we're going to all have to figure out how to deal with. Or acute here. I would say there's other countries that it's equally acute in but I think there's multiple reasons for it. There's some people that don't want to go into an office or into a hospital or into a service center any longer would rather try to find ways to work from home. I think there's a whole host of issues that we're trying to solve for there but it's something that has a healthcare system across all healthcare we have to solve together. Definitely. And when we're talking about the whole world, obviously that's something that we didn't touch on a lot right now but talking about the global trends, do they all kind of align with what you're seeing in the

 where they've actually were asking questions about what did we do for COVID, what did we learn, and when I would talk about the at-home collection, there was certainly some interest there.

At this point, you're just like, please ask me about more than the COVID vaccine. Well, now's your chance because I also wanna ask about all the other candidates you have in your pipeline.

. What are you looking at when it comes to the timeline for these other candidates? Sure, I mean, as you see, and as you know, modernize a platform company and, unfortunately, most people know us about COVID, we're very of a thankful and grateful for the ability to help that we have with the pandemic and still now we're being on booster. But modernize a platform company. So let's start with vaccines where indeed in addition to the unneuroblated booster, for COVID, we are gonna get in Q1 of

So we need to be more physically contacting the disease that we have in the COVID-based pre-study. But that's becoming the Q1 timeframe according to current epidemiology analysis. And now of course, the combination. As you know, we are working with a COVID-19 that's through in a single dose. Also COVID-19 has flu plus R has been a single dose. So you see more than that, we're really pushing the vaccine portfolio for respiratory disease better so for late and viruses. Those viruses that once in a body, I know putting

 mRNA to give the breadth of coverage, we would do so. That is the commitment. And then as we discuss, we're going to combine this with the global vaccine, which is through and over respiratory virus, to make it easier for people to get strong growth protection against many viruses. So to reduce healthcare costs, as we know, when you go to get different vaccination, the cost of administration is a big part. In some hospitals, it's actually higher than the cost of a vaccine. So I think there's a big role we can do there. And in terms of low-income countries, we actually,

. I'm glad you brought that up. I saw that announcement. And I wonder when it comes to the mRNA platform, let's let me get nerdy with you for a second here. The mRNA platform does have that quick, very strong efficacy that we saw, but also does win. As do most protection, we do see that with the antibody titers. But is this something that you are looking at? Is it something that needs to be changed or tweaked about the platform to give longer, maybe more stable protection? Or is this just how the technology works? So I think we should not forget with COVAX, which is the virus has changed a lot. And if you remember, when the virus was rotating very slowly, that

, you saw great performance of a vaccine. We should not forget that we've all made from the genetic drift was so gigantic in

 step that I think no vaccine, no technology would have been able to hold efficacy of infection strongly. Because it's thing to antibodies, and antibodies when we've time, that is not linked to mRNA, that is linked to all immune system as humans. The pitat is very important to see is that despite the lowering of efficacy against infection, the efficacy against hospitalization and deaths are still very, very important. And that's because, as we believe, there is very strong T cell immune memory components in terms of technology. So I think it's a bit like flu. You need to get a new flu shot, not because the protein technology is not good. I believe it is really good. But because it's a different virus, and so you need to radicate your immune system for these different virus, especially if you are high-risk. Again, a

 time when the beam going in and then it's setting, then the pandemic setting. So I think we'll be smarter in a more fortu. But the correct data surely is a better uptake than the seasonal flu shot. And I think it's going to be a flu, which is, again, if you're 25 or you need an annual booster

And we did not compensate or give new jobs to the losers. Also people in low-value-added industry, but now even services are losing their jobs in income. That's why there's a backlash. They're also environmental issues. Now there is geopolitics, like

, populists of the extreme left are going to come to power. I think that it's driven mostly by economic malice. When there is a rise in income and wealth inequality, and we've seen it across the world, in advance, it's emerging markets, those who are left behind, and it doesn't matter whether they vote for the right or the left, those who vote for the right are usually socially and religiously conservative, those who vote for the left tend to be liberal. But on economic issues, they're nativists, they're nationalists, they're against migration, they're against free markets, they're against the forces of economic reform. Why? Because they're left behind, and they blame the elites, economic, financial, political, for leaving them behind. That's why there is a severe economic reason behind this backlash against liberal democracy, and extreme populists who are the right on the left. But as we know, populists who are the right on the left doesn't lead to economic opportunity. Eventually, it's to inflation, stagnation, and financial disaster and default. How were it should we be about the

. And it's the beginning of something else. You didn't mention climate change, so I'm assuming you're not worried about that. Well, there's a full chapter about an unhabitable planet, about climate change. And it's a long discussion, but there's a lot of talk about doing something about climate change. There's a lot of talk about ESG investment, environmental, social and governance and so on. But reality is a lot of it is greenwashing. A lot of it is green wishing. A lot of it is green fig leaves, or people would say we're going to do something, governments, firms, individual. They're doing nothing.

 is dystopian and the other one, what I call utopian or less dystopian. In the dystopian one, of course, all these things feed on each other and there's an interaction between each other and them. And then we end up into essentially disaster. We can destroy each other with a nuclear war, with geopolitical collapse, with climate change, with financial meltdowns, with collapse of liberal democracy, with pandemics and you name it. There is another path in which we have policies, the national level, and international levels slowly, slowly resolve this problem and therefore the future. Maybe it's not utopian, but we avoid the disaster. It's still a challenged future. It's one that has lots of trouble, but we manage it. However, in the epilogue of the book, after this

 chapter, I say from my point of view, I believe that the dystopian one, as of now, is more likely than the utopian. So the utopian, of course, is the desirable one. The question is whether it's a political will, domestically, internationally, to cooperate, and collaborate, to avoid an incoming, meltdown, and disaster. I fear not. Quick,

But at this point, we cannot keep on kicking the hand down the road, reaching the point in which these things are going to materialize in a way in which not only in

 when that was a lot of money and almost went public and then the market crashed and we crashed and it's heartbreaking to put your in that company. We found out a business school.

I'd just been an intern and so you know you put your heart and your soul and people trust you and believe in you and it's it sucks to go through that and that that crash which you know more movies should be made about that time period but certainly informs it because you know you first of all I learned a lot that I know about product management and how to manage internet companies that help me later on. A lot of hands-on experience and then yeah going through that which then happened again in

 and you know what I would say is every one of them is different you know if you kind of look at the causation of each one of these right you can't really equate the you know the dot com boom and crash to covid and what happened with the world shutting down or the global financial crisis or now which is kind of an instant combination of both they're all unique they're all different but certainly and we could talk about it some of the ways that that could inform both opportunities and challenges. Yeah I mean let's talk about that a bit more what do you see as the parallels that are there and how does what you experience in the 90s kind of inform what you're seeing

 of all if you're an existing company you know one that has been through the boom and raised money during the boom evaluations that were pretty rosy and you know you went through hiring and perks for your company and probably you know easier on the revenue side because other companies weren't going through those challenges you have to really reevaluate quickly and get those costs of control kind of reevaluate you know how you view your market and your valuation you know in a lot of cases if you're a public company you know again it's it's easy to sit there and think about the way things were and and and operate that way that I think the companies that adapt the most quickly if you're an existing company are you know are the ones that are going to make it through I think

 in those categories. Those are things I can work with. We can put great teams against that, reinvigorate these products, which certainly needed in a lot of these ways. There are reasons why these things are number

. There's also reasons why it hasn't totally fulfilled its potential in each one of these. So that you can work with. And coming from where we're coming from now, coming out, is an incredible investment opportunity for those who have been behind it.

 thing we have seen the changes or inside baseball but you've also talked about seeing a spin-off in these individual brands that you think that they can stand alone and i can help but think that if you think about you know sort of that that the major you know tech companies and i know you don't want to define you as just a tech company but you'll get somebody like an alphabet or somebody you know like a meta they've got multiple brands that have sort of come together what why think about them separately and why that the idea of going towards that well let's work backwards

 step is to work in them individually now if you do that and i'm not worried about it so the the notion of what we do with these things will they all go public together will they all live together will they spin off those are all things we have the option to do uh... but i don't think about them because i've still feel like i just got here and we want to our team wants to be the one to create this value uh... and create them across the board so i think these are all investment opportunities uh... the the end game for each of them is is something we don't think about yet one and on a uh... a personal question because in prepping for this looked at a lot of your interviews and correct me if i'm wrong but i get the sense that you like being the underdog you have a bit of a chip on your shoulder so my question to you is what whatever you want to define yahu as let's call it a turnaround story that's what people are saying what do you have to prove by building out yahu to where you want it to be it's interesting i'd say of the things that i was i could have done i would say in a way they may be would have been more in the realm of something i could have proven in this case this is something i've done a few times before we my teams have been so very successful doing them we have we have great people we've met great people here as well brought in new people that we didn't work before i'm loving the way the team here is shaping up i love being a part of that right the

. So in some ways, this is uncomfortable, but familiar territory. And we know bear markets end. The average bear market lasted

. So, you know, perhaps we're hitting the mid-mark of the average. The backdrop certainly matters. And you know, more severe bear markets tend to take place with more systematic risks or deep recessions. We don't see either of those things. And so I do think that kind of history is important. And it also is important to look at returns. And as you noted, of course, we've had a very tough time for equities. Equities fall anywhere between sort of

 in bear markets. We're

    just over 20%

. But we also know that during bear markets, there tends to be a lot of volatility. And there tends to be a lot of updates. And we,

's a good example. We had a couple of examples

 where we have these incredible rallies in the middle of a bear market. So I do think investors should have some historical perspective. And then perhaps take a deep breath because although it's really tempting to try to time investing over a bear market cycle, gosh, when you see those numbers ripping up and down, you feel like you should do something. Unfortunately, the best, but most uncomfortable thing to do is to do nothing because we have these great days in the market that are quickly followed by

 of the best days of the market happen in a bear market. So again, I think it highlights the perils of trying to time markets and the risk that you're going to be out of the market on

. And wages have stabilized but at a high level. So we do see lots of inflation elements coming down and we are watching really closely what happens to wages because that's going to really dictate what happens to CPI and core CPI and core

 obviously would keep a very close eye on what your assessment just of the jobs market and how substantially we need to see maybe some of that growth begin to cool in order to get inflation under control. You're absolutely right. It's economics 101. We have more demand for labor than we have supply and it's really shocking actually to look at the numbers. When you look at the

, there's just a mismatch. So yes, the ultimate soft landing would be slowing demand enough that the brunt of that is felt on the opening side. So companies just freeze hiring versus actually increasing unemployment. That's a pretty tough needle to thread. It's, yeah, certainly is a very tough needle to thread. Kady, I want to go back to what you said earlier when you were just talking about you gathered some data I know on the cost of panicking pulling out, pulling your money out of the market in a volatile time like this.

. So there's a really high cost of missing out. And as I said before, we tend to see very strong days of the market during bear markets and the really tough time for investors. And again, it goes back to market time. It's always difficult. But it's really difficult during these times of high volatility and bear markets. The reason is the best days and

 tend to clump together. So you're never going to get it right because you're going to have a terrible day followed by

. So the best advice, the best guidance for investors, especially during times like this, is stay the course, stick with your strategy. Make sure that your equity risk, that your risk assets are aligned to your longer term goal. So you don't have to worry about short-term volatility, but you really need to stick to your strategy or your risk missing out. So you don't want to try and tie in the market. You don't want to panic and pull your money out. You mentioned strategy there. Where are you seeing the most opportunity

? So it's really interesting because I do think it's an opportunity right now for investors to rethink fixed income. We've been talking about the bear market and equities, but my goodness, we have had a steep reset in interest rates and a bear market in bonds. And right now, fixed income is actually paying income. So investors who had been forced to take risk in prior periods because there was no return can really think more deeply about their risk tolerance. And fixed income might be a good place to be right now. We're seeing

</mark>
 type yields in muni bonds. So you are seeing some pretty nice current returns out of fixed income. So that's a place I would say would be a great place for investors to reconsider. Those who have been sort of bearish on bonds because the rates were so low. Well, now we seem to have much better rates. The last thing I would say on that, though, is from an equity perspective, we still do see the best opportunities in

 as having some exogenous headwinds specifically related to energy that are just really hard to price into markets right here. When it comes to the growth versus value debate here in the

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr"> value names. You know, we always preach diversification and I will say that with an economy that's slowing and interest rates probably stabilizing.

's purpose is really about saving money and helping people lead better lives. Technology is such a critical part of delivering on this promise. And that's what we are setting out to do, whether it is enabling the customer to be able to buy right in the middle of their social feed when they get inspired or having their products delivered all the way into the refrigerator. We are building the technology that enables all of this to happen. And we are building tools and capabilities that are completely transforming our business. Retail is getting disrupted. And the role of technology really is to actually help Walmart be the retail leader in the disruption that's already starting to happen. And we can see that in customer experiences, we can see that in the way in which we use data to drive efficiencies, we can see that in the ways in which our associates are working in order to be able to serve our customers better, all of this is part of the transformation that is enabled by technology. And that's what me and the team are setting out to do. And we'll get into more of the specifics in just a bit. But I want to pull back because you've talked a lot about the transformations that have happened in retail. And you've said, look, they happen

. I think a lot of our viewers are familiar with the most recent one, which I would argue is the push to e-commerce driven by your competitor,

. But you say we are in the middle of another cycle. What does that look like? Yes. See, every industry goes through disruptive cycles. Typically, all of these things are actually driven by advances in technology. Like you mentioned, the last big disruption in retail was really the introduction of e-commerce that was enabled by the growth of internet. But since then, we have seen so many improvements in technology. We have got incredible computing power in the palm of our hands. We have mapped 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #e4e7d2; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

</mark>
 of the planet. We have computers through deep learning that can recognize and understand natural language. And we have computers that can recognize objects. All of these things are coming together. And they are the fuel for the next round of disruption that we are already starting to see. We are starting to see that in the way in which customers are finding, discovering, and getting inspired for new products. We are seeing disruptions in terms of how people shop. We are seeing disruption in terms of how products get delivered to the customers. Walmart is in a unique position because the true disruptors are those who are going to really be able to look at the entire whole customer experience. It's not just about online. It's not just about the stores. It's about making sure that the customer experience is a delightful experience from the time that they get inspired all the way to when the product gets delivered. It's not just only about reducing friction. It's about creating a delightful experience. And that is actually going to continue to get disrupted. Walmart, like I said, is the company that can take care of the entire whole customer experience and the role of technology is to be...</div>

. Let's talk about the in-house part of it. How are you determining where to put your investments? How much of this is about driving efficiencies to improve the experience? How much of it is about the shopping experience itself? Absolutely. So the way in which we look at our technology investments largely, there are

</mark>
 different things that we concentrate on. First like I said is really about the customer experience. We want to create absolutely delightful customer experiences no matter how they shop and when they shop and where they shop. Great example is what we just rolled out which is be your own model. Shopping for an outlet, we want to make it as fun as possible. When you're shopping for an outlet, you don't want to rely on some model that we have chosen to see what the output actually looks like. So this is the technology that we have used advanced machine learning so that we know how the outlet will actually drape on your particular body. So you can be a lot more comfortable about buying that particular outlet. It reduces friction, it makes it more delightful and it increases trust. So those are

 major areas of disruption. Crypto falls in sort of the middle of it. I have talked before about the way in which customers are getting inspired and discovering products. That is changing. Part of that is going to happen in the matter of it. Part of that is going to happen on live streams inside your social media app. So whether it is physical goods or virtual goods, they play a part in terms of what the customer wants.

 will become an important part of how customers transact. We want to make sure that we make it as friction free for customers to be able to transact and to be able to buy. How they are able to drive value out of it. That is where I think a lot of the disruption is going to start happening in terms of different payment methods, different payment options. The role of crypto is going to continue to play a very important role in that. Obviously, we want to be there where the customer really needs us to be. The last part of it is how products get delivered. A lot of disruption going on over there. When you specifically talk about crypto, it is going to be about discovery of products whether it is physical or virtual inside, either the metaphors or upfront and then how people transact. Okay, certainly a lot of people are going to be looking for an announcement potentially from

. We are certainly moving towards the tokenization of a lot of new kind of ideas and a lot of things today that may have frictions or maybe not the most efficient types of settlements or oversight of ownership or perhaps authenticity. That's one of the things that NFTs as a technology are helping us to understand. So I think from an investor standpoint, we are certainly moving into that realm where a pie chart that investor has, which is diversified across equities and fixed income and commodities. Certainly is gonna have a slice that goes towards crypto or digital assets more broadly. How diversified that'll be depends on who the investor is. And how they actually start to think about crypto affecting the other things they invest in. I mean, is crypto really better than the

 would be a really bad mechanism to use if you didn't want to get caught doing something. So I don't think that that is as nearly as prevalent as it once was. And for that very reason. And how do you look at some of the experiments that some of these countries have undertaken with crypto? I mean, like

, maybe a mixed picture there? I mean, it's one of those places in the world, right? Where a lot of these economies have been either dollar-based or they're not doing a terribly great job managing their own currency. A lot of people have moved into leveraging mobile technology. So they're living their lives on their phones. It doesn't have to be a brand new

. But they're moving into a state where the connectedness of cell technology is bringing them together. And their banking either hasn't caught up or isn't allowing them to have access to those types of services. And so

 and these types of technologies are actually allowing people to enter the conversation, create savings, pass money to the next generation. Things that just the traditional banking system may not be catching up to you in certain parts of the world. I mean, is it possible then that because we're in a place in the world where we rely on the dollar and fiat and legacy systems are so prevalent that we don't see the change coming in the rest of the world? I think that's one of the unique things about being a grayscale. You know, being at our parent, part of our parent company,

 is happening. We actually have companies that are building products and services in every corner of the globe and seeing how volumes are changing. See what customer adoption looks like, seeing how often people transact. And the numbers tell a really compelling story. And we've talked about this before,

. But what about the correlation between just plain vanilla equities and crypto? And let me have you answer that and we get to other correlations. So it's a great question because the narrative on this has flipped very recently. When you look at where and how crypto has historically been categorized, it actually has followed tech stocks and a lot of the momentum trades that we've historically seen in the equities market. Some of those assets are down

 plus percent year to date. And what's interesting is that even though crypto has fallen precipitously in

 in particular, it's actually now been trading very tightly in this band. And so the volatility that you're seeing in crypto has come down tremendously. So a lot of folks are now looking at that narrative and saying, well, is that going to hold up when crypto does wake up from this crypto

? Is it going to continue to follow those types of trades and be that kind of momentum? Or is the macro environment really reshaping the way people might think about crypto's role in a portfolio? What about the economy then,

 and other folks not so much saying that this is just a relatively momentary blip in the grand scheme of things. Eventually, we might see things move to all time highs and in the not too distant future. I think crypto does this. It's done this multiple times and unfortunately, we'll probably do it again.

 before and again what hasn't killed crypto has made it stronger. How is your business as a CEO looking out and seeing growth, customer relationships? Are you seeing a slowdown? Maybe that would have to do with overall economic activity rather than adoption of crypto. Well certainly investors are continuing to average down on their positions. I think a lot of investors realize that anytime you see this type of pullback and your conviction on something has fundamentally changed, that's something you should be taking advantage of. So investors are not shying away from that perspective. So investors are now also, I'd say, as informed as they've ever been on the asset class itself and so they're always looking for new opportunities to either diversify their exposure. And we're starting to see that they're developing interesting narratives around different sub-themed or sub-categories of crypto, much the same way they do around the equity space. And final question

, talk about the demographics of people who are buying crypto and maybe how that's changing and some trends you've seen recently. The stigma that crypto is only for young males rose. It's over. It's over. What we've seen is that crypto has continued to pervade men and women. We've seen it actually creep up into older demographics. They realize the staying power of the asset class. And as a result of that, the momentum has been there and I think it'll continue to move into other demographics as well.

, I'll kick things over to you to really kind of set the scene, especially as we've seen kind of this deceleration or this decline in some of the crypto prices right now and where that kind of influences some of the investment decisions going forward to. Yeah,

 thought is sort of just to tee it up, you know, in

 under macro conditions and then a lot of sort of idiosyncratic sort of issues with the asset class, insolvencies, all that. And you know, that was obviously something unique since then, cryptocurrencies have mainly stayed fairly flat compared to other assets like equities. And so I think that's a good place just to start, just to turn it over to each of the panelists,

, there was still this question, is crypto as a class? It really was kind of the Bitcoin or blockchain days and is this just a flash in the pan, is it all going to vanish and just evaporate? And this time around, I think there is a sense of the stickiness, the inevitability of this, not just as an asset class, but as a technology, it's going to have tremendous impact, I think, across a broader variety of industry ecosystems and subsets than just financial services. Christine, same question to you. What's different between this crypto

, we've seen mass adoption in a variety of different forms. So, you know, we saw, for example, a number of technological enthusiasts, financial enthusiasts participating in yield farming through the DeFi summer of

. And then across this whole time, a broader adoption of stablecoins for payments and regular business use cases like just trying to pay like my employees globally. You know, now the result of this is that a broader audience has become more informed around this technology. A number of those use cases required being able to set up a self-costive wallet, a self-costive crypto wallet. And so, you know, basically what we're dealing with now is a more and like kind of invested audience and intellectually invested in terms of like having done the work to get set up with this ecosystem. The last crypto cycle was really brutal and long. And for those that managed to survive, they went on to become the biggest companies and protocols in our industry. And so, I would say that in this crypto cycle, or in the last bull cycle, you know, many of the investors and the companies raised, oh, what sounded like a regis amount of money at the time, but basically building a war chest to whether

? And so with that in mind, there's the traditional thought of what's the path to profitability for some of those companies? And is that perhaps that path to profitability hindered because you don't necessarily have the immediate return? And it's a much further looking out type of investment that you're really evaluating here. How does that really influence some of your investment thesis around Web 3? Sure. Just taking a step back, a lot of buzzwords in the space. It's got crypto, blockchain, digital assets, NFTs,

 technology shift that is accelerating financial innovation. It's driving new investor behaviors, and it's creating new financial markets infrastructure that has already begun to start impacting payments, capital formation, lending and borrowing, and asset management, and then a long tail of other things including culture. Now, we blockchain nerds that are in the industry like to think of what's being built as the internet of value. Now, the internet that most of all of you know and love, we think of as the internet of information, basically the set of technological protocols that made it possible to make

. That didn't really necessarily work, nor is there really a business case to do that. And it won't be magic internet money that ignores the financial realities of appropriate risk and return. I think that the recent crypto markets unwind and market idiosyncrasies we've seen have proven that, but it's going to be a unique, never-before-seen intersection of crypto-native, new product and market development that has been grounded in the financial realities of risk and return relative to the broader tradeable markets. Powered by automation and composability, we've seen through smart contracts and digital ledgers. So, at least here at

It's critically important to the entire ecosystem and the decisions made I think over

, with that in mind, and perhaps it's trivial of me to ask to kind of apply the rule of threes to this, but if I were to ask, what are

 big things that regulators need to get right when they're thinking about and working through what crypto legislation should look like, especially here in the

 things be? Oh, gosh, it's so hard to pick, right? So here's the

 things I think that are important to keep in mind. And one is this is global. Nobody's waiting for

, start to be implemented. That's going to have huge implications potentially on how builders build, how consumers engage with this technology offerings. The

</mark>
 thing I would say it's really important to note is despite the attention on the price and this entire framing of this conversation is about how that's not the most important or only thing, this is about a lot more than just financial services products. This really is about building a new version of the internet, decentralized internet, Christine laid out what Web

 with that concept means. So thinking about how this will work in spaces like data, spaces like creative, the creative economy, all of that is really, really important. So global frame, more than financial services and products. And the

 thing I would say is that the details really, really matter. So I think a lot of folks tend to think of regulation as just kind of providing this very broad playbook, but actually there's a lot of nuance and detail and the competitions are happening live right now. And a lot of that is going to be critically important. So meeting with technologists, making sure there's understanding about what's actually happening in the trajectory, what's moving forward is also just a critical, it's just critical and crucial here, even more than it's ever been before I'd say in other industries. So

 to be part of everyday person's life? I mean, if we're going to transact and get our coffee or whether we're going through a car transaction, what is the time table that we have to look out towards? Okay, that's a really good question. I mean, I guess the thing with technology evolution, it's one of these things where, when you're in it, it rolls out quite slowly and incrementally, but then in retrospect, it looks like it happened very fast. And so.</div>

, I've seen the building blocks of blockchain protocols like actually become like be created and get adopted. Or, you know, stable coins like get created or, you know, the primitives around like lending and borrowing via smart contracts, which later evolved into

. Like all of these things started as like very big ideas against a backdrop of like, you know, a difficult reality. In fact, that it didn't exist. And also there was a lot of regulatory, you know, stuff to navigate. But in

, all of that has actually come to fruition. Think like ideas have come to life. And they've been used and actually tested with real money. And actually have had multiple teams around the world with different, you know, levels of expertise around technology and financial markets and infrastructure all contributing in open source code. So, you know, it's moving fast with very moving fast and slow at the same time. In terms of, and so, you know, I feel like we're just kind of at the stage where, you know, the key building blocks of the infrastructure have been put in place. But now it's about the real world applications. And this is like where, you know, the real world assets that were hyper focused on from

's point of view, you know, may start to emerge. But then additionally, a lot of work around user experience, you know, blockchain technology is actually back end technology. And, you know, if we do this right, Web

 doesn't become a noticeable part of our lives. Like it just like sinks into the background. It's just stuff that like drives, you know, the applications and our use cases. And in fact, it becomes a little bit boring. And so, you know, basically it would say like in

, we should see an acceleration once the foundation now that the foundational pieces are in and now it's more focused on what do people find compelling. I think NFTs were a glimpse of how a broader user base could be compelled with, you know, use cases that were broadly cultural, like maybe less financial. And so, you know, we're a small subset of us nerds that, you know, we're kind of building really interested in, you know, all of the hyper financialization overall. So I think the path to, you know, broader adoption is probably something more fun, funny than that. Absolutely. Well, that's

, we're seeing it pop up in every single type of criminal activity the department looks into. We really need to bring together those who had been working on this issue for some time in order to address the more cutting-edge issues that we're looking at. And so, as you mentioned, one of the focuses we have is to make sure that we are appropriately addressing the ecosystem, looking at mixers, tumblers, and exchanges, and other money laundering platforms that help facilitate that type of criminal activity. And we also want to basically up everyone's baseline game when it comes to digital asset prosecutions and investigations, because we're seeing it in ransomware, we're seeing it in frauds and thefts of all sorts. And we want to make sure that it's not just the specialists who have the tools necessary to fight and disrupt this type of criminal activity, but that prosecutors from throughout the department can have access to those tools, understand how best to use them, and know where the resources are throughout the department to help them and their fights and their cases. Yeah, and you're speaking obviously to this prosecutor network that was recently announced. And so, I'm curious there, what does success look like for that? I think, well, just to give you a little bit of background, digital asset coordinators network is a dedicated network of

 plus prosecutors drawn from across the department. That's the

 attorney's offices as well as a different sections. It may just as they deal with things such as national security issues, antitrust, environmental and natural resources, crimes, and even in the civil division and the tax divisions as well. And the idea is to be able to have a network of prosecutors devoted to being the

 line of fence in each of their offices. So, in any investigation in which digital asset or cryptocurrency issue comes up, people will know where in their office to find the help that they need to understand these technologies and to stay abreast of all the developments that we're seeing in the ways in which those technologies can be abused by bad actors. So, that's really what the network is about. And success for us is making sure that each prosecutor feels empowered and armed with the right tools, knows how to apply the authorities that we already have to combat these crimes, and realizes that each prosecutor realizes that for every investigation, there are going to be challenges, digital assets is one that you can address using the tools that we have in many instances and just understanding the new ways in which we're applying them to a new problem set. And how is prosecuting cases involving crypto different from other assets? So, I think there are a few technological aspects of cryptocurrency that make them pose certain challenges and also certain benefits along enforcement. So, I think the easiest thing to think about is public ledgers for the most part, most of the cryptocurrency crime that we see still rely on public ledger technologies, in which case you have a ledger that is available, you can see all the transactions that anyone's ever had. Now, that is very useful in terms of trying to chase down the flow of funds for any criminal activity, but we still need to understand how to get behind the addresses that are on that ledger. We'll know that the transaction may be criminal, but who is actually behind that particular, but that particular transaction, that particular address. And that's one of the tricky things about cryptocurrencies that it has built in this sort of anonymity, pseudonymity factor, because it does not necessarily put a one to one on the address and the actual real person that's behind those types of transactions. These are also very cross border in nature. So, you know, an example I like to give is, you might have someone who's a victim of a cryptocurrency crime in

, and trying to deal with bringing together all the different sources of data that you really need to do, both off-chain and off-on-chain, in order to get to the bottom of whose behind criminal activity can be tricky. Like it is in all cyber cases across border investigations, generally. And also that it's, you know, these transactions are immutable and they're irreversible. That's one of the benefits to cryptocurrency in some instances, and that these transactions can oftentimes be relatively frictionless and quick, but it also means that if we identify a particular transaction as being criminal, we can't go to some centralized, you know, financial institution and ask for that money to come back. That's not how the blockchain works. And so finding ways to deal with that and still be able to chase funds to places where we may be able to capture those criminal proceeds back and provide them to the victims is one of the challenges that we face in this area. Right, and the decentralized area of crypto, which defies a broad term, it can mean a lot of different things. You know, it's one of the most promising areas, at least people working in the crypto industry, say, but it's obviously a place that, you know, has been fraught with what you call security exploits

, or, you know, hacks to people sort of say they're the same thing, sometimes they're kind of slightly different. So I was sort of curious, given the amount of hacks we've seen, it seems like one every week.

, you know, what's you, what is the responsibility of sort of the private sector versus the public sector, in sort of reducing the level of exploits in crypto? And added to that, what do you think the root problem is? You know, I think what is going on here is that the crypto industry and

, even. And so I think it's, you know, unprecedented in the amount that the industry has grown and the ways in which

 have evolved the technologies that have traditionally been used in a variety of different ways, but now are being used to create financial products that in sophisticated multi-chain, you know, means. And so I think especially in these cross-bridge hacks situations, which what you're alluding to. The bottom line is that the industry is still in our view in a maturation phase. A lot of respects we're looking at companies and hoping that they will understand that doing things such as basic risk reduction, having robust compliance programs, and ensuring that they are decreasing the opportunities for these type of exploits on their own platform, it's sort of the first best line of defense. And I think, you know, a lot of these exploits, as we see them, are situations in which the code is exploited in part because, you know, maybe there would have been if there had been more robust code audits, for instance. People might have caught these particular opportunities for exploitation before the code gets pushed out writ large. And so in those situations, we're hoping that people will now see every week we have multi, you know,

</mark>
 exploits along those lines. People will start trying to think about ways in which they're making their code more robust before it's pushed out. I think that's the bottom line. Yeah. And I mean, how does what does a partnership look like between the private sector and public sector and sort of enabling more security auditing, I guess, before kids pushed out? Because obviously this is a, you know, this is a fast-moving industry. Yeah, I think it's just, I think it's a recognition that we have to work with the private sector and ensure that they understand the ways in which we've identified particular tactics that bad actors might be using in order to exploit these types of platforms. I think generally there is an understanding that 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #bfe1d9; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

, if you see a new one of these, perhaps people within the industry are going to think twice before sent pushing out code or invest more in the front end auditing and basic sort of cyber security concerns that we see, you know, as a general matter that we have is an issue that occurs within the private sector. I mean, I think people are now in the mindset where they realize it's hyper security is a serious concern from a business risk perspective and it requires investments on the front end from those who are responsible, not just sort of rush.</div>

 nation-state actors who seem to be behind a lot of these particular types of exploits and using them as a means to avoid sanctions regime design to limit their weapons of mass destruction program.

 thing, but if we're just thinking about from for individual investors, what is the most concerning sort of digital crime trend or crypto crime trend that you've been following? So I think one of the things that we're particularly concerned about is that there's a lack of familiarity about the technology, but the average

</mark>
 consumer or investor might be looking at historically pretty significant returns on certain types of cryptocurrency investments. And so it's a combination of fear of missing out, FOMO plus a lack of familiarity in the technology that allows some investors to have sometimes be duped by fraudulent schemes that are out there that people who would abuse the name of crypto and the promise of innovation, and quite frankly participate in a series of old school Ponzi schemes or rug polls or other types of thefts and frauds that happen with the

 public. And I think just sort of making sure that investors understand that they should be applying the same type of scrutiny that they apply to their normal investments and traditional finance to crypto would go a long way. So if someone something sounds like it's too good to be true, maybe it is in fact too good to be true, like guaranteed higher returns on investments without a real clear explanation as to what's going on. If you don't understand the technology and what exactly the product is doing, then perhaps try to do more research to figure out this is the type of thing that you want to be investing in. And generally using your good sense in trying to make these decisions and not trying to be swept up in the

 that gets used in the crypto industry to make investment decisions that you might regret later on. I mean, there have been good returns in certain circumstances, but it's an incredibly volatile asset class. And so people need to be wary of that and think about that when they're actually investing in their overall portfolio. Absolutely. On your guide, thank you so much for coming to talk. Of course.

 and 21 were terrible. I mean, in the beginning of the pandemic, we were down

 variant in the spring and throughout and into the fall, we've seen very, very steady recovery. So I would say we're at the beginning of what I think is going to be a new golden age of travel. I mean, what happened is a lot of people thought. In fact, you guys were asking me

, was anybody going to want to travel again? And it turned, and I said at that time, of course, people need to travel for all sorts of reason. They want to travel because they want to see people in places they need to travel for, you know, for business purposes, they need to travel to congregate as part of meetings and events for all sorts of reasons, whether it's, you know, culture building, whether it's sales conferences, whatever, whatever it might be. And they're doing it. And so we've seen a very strong recovery in all segments of the business led by the leisure business, but very strong recovery and business travel, very strong recovery in meetings and events. And it continued throughout

, and it is continuing into the fall. So I'd say, you know, we're in the midst of a very strong rebound coming out of your words, not mine, a

, take us further into that demand rebound that you're seeing right now. And especially as it relates to the corporate travel, this is a cohort of consumers that really accounts for so much of the profit margins for leisure and hospitality businesses. So when you're re-engaging with them, you know, what have you been able to track to say in your forecasts, going even into

</mark>
 that this is going to continue to return, especially as they're looking across some of their own travel and expense policies. And that's tightening a little bit right now. Yeah, well, I mean, yeah, clearly that is, and we expect it to continue. Having said that, there's a huge amount of pent up demand,

, that is being released for all sorts of business travel. When you back up and look at the core of our business travel population, even pre-COVID, it was 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #e4e7d2; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

 small and medium-sized businesses, that's probably 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #e4e7d2; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

, maybe even a little bit higher

. And what we found during COVID, certainly in recovery, is that there are a lot more resilient. And the reason is that they're running their businesses, they have to get out and travel. They have to meet their partners. Their salespeople have to get out. They have to go to their other offices. And so they don't have as much of the luxury of saying that they're not going to travel. And so what we've seen is the big corporate business transient has been, is recovered nicely, and is recovering in a very strong way now, but is still not back to historic levels where small and medium businesses are above

 historical high water marks. And I think it has a lot to do, as I said, with just people going for an extended period of time without doing the basic things that they needed to do to run their business. And I think it was a really neat idea to think that you could do everything virtually and everything on

, and you could do all your culture building and all your innovation, and all your sales, and all the partner and relationship work in a very efficient format, but the real truth is you can't. And I think that was proven. And so I think what we're seeing is sort of the other side of that where people certainly are.</div>

, but the real truth is you can't. And I think that was proven. And so I think what we're seeing is sort of the other side of that, where people certainly are going to use technology. I'm not going to be silly about it in different ways. And the technology as it advances will take certain tripocations and change them. But they're just being replaced with higher value tripocations because people realize they have to be out and meeting one-on-one or in groups with people. And so I feel very good about where things are going. And clearly the macro environment is more challenging. There's no question that here in the

 and in much of the world with inflation where it is that central banks, including the

 here at home, are going to do what they have to do to slow demand in order to get inflation under control. I think that's a given. I think it would be crazy to say that that's not happening and going to continue to happen. But what's happening in our business is, as you said, we were not a beneficiary of COVID. We got beaten up quite badly. And we're seeing sort of the unwinding of a lot of that that gives us quite a bit of wind in our sales. I think for a reasonably extended period of time, what are those things that are being released? Well, people are changing their spending patterns, right? They are spending, during COVID, they spend all their time online buying things, okay? Whatever that was, cars, washers, dryers, microwaves, things, phones, technology. Now they're shifting their spending patterns back to what they had been doing pre-COVID, which has been a

 trend towards spending on experiences. Well, we're experiences. So we have this big secular shift back to experiences. The other thing we have going on is international travel. The world is almost all of the world is open up. There are parts that are still not, probably

 being the most notable, certain parts of

, sort of back in and going. We have a long way to go to get back where we were, but it is starting to happen. And then as I already mentioned, just pent up to man. Just people had

 of not doing things they needed to do, whether that was for leisure or business or meetings and events. And that is being released. So in the face of some macro headwinds, we have some pretty nice tailwinds that are propelling our recovery forward still. And you can look at the industry data we haven't reported. So I'm not going to talk about our data, but you can look at all the industry data up through

. But technology is connecting the world, speeding the world up and making people more mobile. And the reality is COVID accelerated that process where the office environment is changing, how you work, how I work, how everybody works is changing. In a way that I think people are going to be on the road more. People being on the road more and being more mobile is very good for our business.

 to sort of stabilize having done their job with inflation more in a control and allow the economy to get its footing again and start uh... process of re-acceleration that is my hope i you know what are the odds right uh... i don't know that you know my own view is that there's a reasonably good chance that we will get a you know reasonable landing you know which is sort of soft to bumpy-ish landing with the economy and as i said it'll be what it'll be in the in the case of our business in industry i think that the tailwinds that we have you know we're are gonna take us for a while just because there's some natural structural things i already described that are happening that are that are wind in our sales that are going to you know get us through a decent period of time depends how long and how deep any slowdown is to know what the impact will be and obviously macro impact is could have impact on us ultimately but you know our businesses in fabulous shape are balance sheets and incredible shape our margins or higher than they've ever been right one in

 let's talk about that room development because as i look across the number of rooms that you have in development at least as of the end of the most recent quarter it's in surplus of

 rooms that are in development right now and so we think through the development pipeline and when those come online how long does it typically take for the property to be a creative to the business and has some of the more short term home stays that the trends in the market are clearly pointing to from consumers has that change the type of developments that you bring online that really that really hasn't so the gestation period once it's under construction at

Again a little bit more leisure a little bit more bleezure sort of the blend of the business and the leisure sort of put together a little bit more you know extended stay so longer stay which favors some of the extended stay brands we have a little bit more but nothing you know nothing off the charts that suggests that any of the brands that we have in our family brands

. I think that the goal is to bring vaccines that they can last a year. I think that would simplify things, because I believe that people will not be that diligent to do the vaccinations as they are tired of making too many vaccines, and they want stability. But if we have a yearly vaccine, which is something that people are used like flu, for example, this is something that will take a significant amount of people to be able to get it. And yes, I think with the right vaccines, we can prevent from infections, to hospitalizations, to deaths and severe diseases. But of course, the vaccine has shown that death and hospitalization, the prevention is very high. And it comes to infections, so the virus is a bit lower. So it's more comparable to a flu than say, a polio, for example, something that you're just trying to eradicate. Oh, unfortunately, this virus is very nasty and makes a lot of variations and insists. So I think, although nobody knows, most scientists are in agreement that for

 company. And you split the revenue with them. How long has that partnership last? Will it last even as we get to different stages of the pandemic? Is it an indefinite partnership? Absolutely. It's an indefinite partnership in COVID. And we are both focusing and bringing new science into building new, most effective vaccines. Apparently, the one most important element is what we discussed before. The vaccine that will last a year. And, of course, combination with flu is another very important. Right. I wanted to ask you about that. You just started phase

 vaccine. Right. And we are about to start a combo as well. And what kind of timeline then do you look for for that? I think the flu vaccine likely based on events, because an event during study, if there's a lot of flu, will come in for a sometime

. We don't do immunobridzing for that one. And we are very confident that the vaccine will have very ill-efficacy. So we went directly to study the efficacy of the vaccine. For regulatory purposes, you're required only to do immunostaties. So that would take their time. And then the combination, if you have already and approved COVID-19, and you have already submitted about to be approved flu, the combination is very easy. Now, you mentioned more international expansion as well. And different ways of marketing the vaccine. You have a partnership in

, we had enough vaccines for all that were produced. But those countries did very small number of vaccinations. It was not the availability of the vaccine, but it was many other reasons, infrastructure of them to be able to administer it, a hesitancy from people.

 companies producing more. I think with BioNTech we have a lot of collaborations. For example, we are about to enter in a zoster vaccine that again is happening with them. And we are working to expand even further. So there will be a lot of things that we are doing together with BioNTech. But they are doing a lot of things alone and we are doing a lot of things alone. We are not shy from collaborations. Actually we believe collaborations is a better way to bring science to the world

. For example, in zine editing we are partnering with another biotech company that they have appropriate technology and to have all the expertise and scale to be able to produce solutions faster. Now, we are going into the pandemic. Before the pandemic even began, there were a lot of questions about Pfizer facing patent cliff, etc., etc. Then the pandemic happened. You had recently come into the company and we are trying to change it culturally and the way that Pfizer did business. The pandemic sort of did that and you did that in concert. So where are you now in terms of that question of what is next for

, access and financial barriers are not what's slowing people. What about indoor air quality? I know there was a recent summit to discuss that, and there's been a lot of attention from some advocates about how to go about addressing that and the role that it plays in the spread of COVID. When you talk about not needing to bring back mitigation measures, I think about indoors and what we really need to think about for

We know that you came on board to help lead this response, but are you surprised that you're still in this role now? And do you see yourself returning to academia anytime soon? Well, am I surprised that I'm still in this role? No. Like, when I think about the work that we have to do every day, I get up

, back when you were in your previous role, it was the day I was getting a vaccine and you were talking about the reports that have been coming about about the difference between who is opting for a vaccine and how it went along party lines and how that wasn't helpful. Now that you're in the hot scene, now that you're in the middle of all the politics, do you still stand by that? Do you, or has the job changed how you perceive or how you see how politicized everything is? Yeah, I still don't see this as a deeply political thing.

, you're going to benefit from these vaccines. You're going to get, but you're going to benefit from treatments. And that's my message and that's what we try to do every day. And lastly, do you think that there are age limits or age parameters around who's really more in need of a vaccine than others? We've had some people say the older individuals or more vulnerable individuals really should get the vaccine and younger healthy ones maybe, maybe able to pass. Yeah, I don't, the way I look at this. I don't look at it.</div>

Yeah, the way I look at this, I don't look at it that way. The way I look at it is we know older people are at high risk. By the way, older people are at high risk for almost every condition. So that's not a new idea. A lot of people seem to have discovered that for COVID that's also true for the flu, by the way. What we know is that older people are gonna, they're at the highest risk, they're gonna benefit the most. Younger people are at lower risk, they're benefits still outweighs their risk of getting vaccinated, which is why I've encouraged all my family to get vaccinated, all my friends to get vaccinated, my nieces and nephews and kids have all gotten vaccinated because for them to benefit outweighs the risk, but no question about it, the biggest benefits are in older

 Look, our brand is positioned in a really great spot. Obviously, as you mentioned, we have some higher household income on average in our customers. We also skew younger, but you know, we serve pretty much all income groups and I don't love to see some of the lower income groups being impacted the way they have, but we're fortunate that we're positioned the way we are with our commitment to food with integrity. And frankly, I think the job that the brand has done to position itself in this space of being, you know, an elevated food experience. So we get people trading down and I think we also get people trading up and just in a really unique position. So, you know, we're pretty fortunate. No doubt about it.

 experience is on roll blocks. That's another interesting foray for fast food we see the others get into the game as well. So my question here is what exactly is the opportunity that you're seeing in the overall metaverse there? You know it's hard to like put it into dollars and actual sales it's much more to do with brand relevance and I think being visible and then playing a role in people's everyday. You know people make their meal decisions or their food decisions every day multiple times a day and I think it's important for them to understand what our brand stands for which is this idea of food with integrity, great culinary. You know we're going to do the right things for our people, our food and then our customers and if they're able to pick that up through programs like roll blocks to you know be real that's hugely important to us and then look we're going to always experiment and that's partly what we're doing with roll blocks. This is more about experimenting so that we can understand where potentially future sales may come from and at a minimum right now it's definitely the right place to be to communicate with young people.

 because we asked our employees, they look, what are the tasks that either trip you up or, you know, you find very hard to get done? Or frankly, when people join our company, they say, look, I don't really love doing that work. And they're kind of figuring out how they can just be done with doing that work. So, some of the things we got feedback on were, hey, it's really tricky to know how much chicken to cook throughout

 because we get rushes, we get slow spots, then we get fast spots again. So, this is really taking, you know, artificial intelligence and understanding real time, how fast are you going through the chicken? How fast are you going through the guacamole? How many, you know, pieces of chicken do you need to go put on the grill now? Because based on what we expect happening at dinner time, this is what you need to cook. And so, it takes a lot of the guesswork out of it for the employee, and then it does it real time. So, that they can be, well, you know, our crew doesn't want to be out of anything, right? Because it's a disappointing situation for the customer, and then the crew doesn't feel like they're doing a great job. So, this is really a tool that will help them be more ready for the rush. And then if the rush exceeds what their expectations were, it informs them so that then they're prepared for the rest of their day so they continue to have

, and then we sell through, and then it's like, oh, we're running out, now we got to go fry chips again. And, you know, look, that's a tough job, too, to be working on the fryer. And so, we got the feedback that, hey, look, if you could automate this for me, that would be a huge win. And so, there's other areas that we're working on as well. You know, we want to automate our digital make line. We're partnering with a company called

. We were growing. We were profitable. We had, I think, a lot of discipline originally being bootstrapped. We thought it was a good time for us to be able to raise a little bit of money, for us to allow our team members to participate in owning part of the company, which I'm really proud of, and I think we were right.

, I've tried to understand what was going on. We kind of came to the conclusion that, over thesis, that the largest provider of financial services in the world, especially in emerging markets, will continue to be technology companies. And that the thesis fundamentally had not changed. And in fact, there were some trends in a market like this one that makes our business much way much more

, although the market is a little bit more painful and the price is really not being able to price that effectively. And so what's happening is that effectively companies, everybody in tech, has been traded the same thing, has been punished the same thing. But there's some whose fundamentals are an alternative, whose thesis is an alternative. That's our case. We're profitable.

 will be a little bit harder. But in reality, what's happening is that everybody's sort of putting the same box without really understanding the differences between the different tech models or the geographies or profitability core or any specific details about the company. Well, and it's not even just tech, right? It's sort of like everything has been thrown into that. That's going to mean you guys, early in earth, are sort of tech first, if you will. But you're a retailer, right? You sell diamonds and different kinds of jewelry. So it's interesting that you

 different companies, different types and categories. But yet, you know, you get this whole tard with the same brush thing when everybody's looking at these new companies. You mentioned a moment ago, you don't forget the timing. You think it was good timing still for the company. So how do you think about the stock price and the reaction that we've seen? I hear David, the direct to consumer has been a more challenging sector as a whole. And I think you end up getting lumped in with all of the companies that ended up going public at the same time period. We're very different. We've been operating for

. We've been growing and profitable. I continue to be growing and profitable. So I think it differentiates us, but investors are still learning. And, you know, frankly, I think there's right now they're not really taking the time to look at each company. They're overwhelmed, based on just some of the volatility. So for us, it's really about how do we, you know, not pay too much attention to what the stock is doing on a day to day basis. You know, makes sure obviously the team is motivated and that we're focused on the long term while making sure that we have the discipline in the current environment. And it seems to me that both of you are probably in modes where it's not as though you would use your stock to go out and acquire that you're sort of organically growing. Would the plans have been different if the stock price had done something different? I think that, you know, at this point, we have a really strong balance sheet. So we have a lot of strategic options that are available to us, whether it's cash, whether it's, you know, how we want to think about organic growth is actually traditionally how we've been growing for

 audience. Love persists in all different types of ups and downs where people continue to get engaged and people to continue to celebrate with jewelry as a source of value. And we're well positioned because we're very asset light. So I think a lot of other companies have big inventories that they need to be able to discount for us, where very inventory light, we're able to scale up to meet the consumer demand. That puts us in a really powerful position so we can really navigate no matter what the current environment is. And it has been a volatile market. I've said that in the past and we're expecting for

 to be able to meet the customer where they are. And that's all I can really do at this point. When you say your inventory light and asset light, how does that work for you?

Yes, we've heard a lot of inventory build news from all kinds of different retailers.

, yes, it's going to be more moderate growth, but relatively to what we have already experienced, it's actually much more positive. And a lot of the trends that we're banking behind are almost uncorrelated with the market. Regardless of where the market grows

 that has no access to banking that are migrating into the digital banking. And so a lot of the technology trends underlying the growth of the business tends to be a bit uncorrelated. We definitely have credit risk and that is the part of our business that has linked to the economy. So we have to have increased resilience in an environment like this one. We've been increasing resilience through

 for you to be a public company. What's the biggest change for you in sort of, whether it's biggest lesson learned, biggest discovery, biggest lifestyle change or you're running around more? What's the biggest difference? Yeah, I'd say transitioning from private company CEO to public company CEO, it's a big change. It's humbling, I think, being able to balance the long-term strategy, articulate the long-term strategy, and also be able to deliver on expectations is, for me, I think, a good lesson to learn. I think it's made us stronger as a company. We've been more transparent with our team, with outside investors, and I think that also helps to clarify internally. We are really going after being the number

? So holding ourselves to that standard, I think, is what the challenge is, but I think it's driven a lot of internal accountability. Interesting. David, what about for you? I would agree with that. I think

, always in communication, it's probably the biggest challenge. You need to be actively communicating with a number of different constituencies, especially when there is so much volatility in a market like this, when things are changing so much. And beyond that, obviously, we don't want to change or view of optimizing the company's value for the long term, with things that that still the right way to run the company. But we need to be able to also show investors that in the short term, we have very high rigor in terms of decisions that we're making, and that there has to be really strong economic fundamentals in the business. So it's balancing the rigor and the communication that we're doing the right things in the short term, with continuing to double down on the long term opportunity that the business has. And I think because we're both profitable, it makes it a lot easier. We're coming from a position of strength. And that's a differentiator too, among those public debut, really quick question for you. Most popular cut among engagement rings right now.

's standpoint, they have to tackle inflation. They have a blunt instrument. They have a blunt instrument which is interest rate policy at this point. They're trying to increase rates. They're trying to increase rates to slow demand down, just take demand out of the economy. They really cannot affect the supply side of the equation. The problem that we have or the issue that people are debating now is the

. We've gone through quite a few interest rate rises already. And the economy has not slowed down from an inflationary standpoint. That said, we all know that this monetary policy takes time to feed itself through the economy. Unfortunately, it hits consumers almost immediately. So if you've got an adjustable rate mortgage, it adjusts

 can try and affect demand, the demand side of the equation. They can make borrowing money more expensive. They can make homes more expensive. They can try and slow consumers down because things are harder to buy because they don't want to finance them. They can't affect the supply side of the equation. And right now when you look at the data and you look at what's going on in the inflationary front, a lot of the inflation comes from commodities and commodity inputs. So by raising interest rates, we don't create more oil. We don't create more food. So we're trying to create a balance of oil. We're trying to create a balance of food. We're trying to create a balance of workers back into the labor force. I think one of the big underlying components of inflation is wage price inflation. We keep seeing

 plus wage inflation. Wages filter through everything we do. As the economy has shifted during COVID to where we're buying lots of goods because we really couldn't leave our houses. So we're buying things, we're having them sent to our houses, and we were consuming goods. We're now back into a more normalized economic cycle. In a normalized economic cycle, we as

, we're good consumers of services. We like to go out, we like to be entertained, we like to travel, we like to go to events. The service economy is all labor. When you go out to a service event, you're really buying mostly labor. So when you go to a concert or you go to a restaurant or you go to a bar, you're buying some inputs, some commodities, but you're buying an awful lot of labor. That labor cost has not come down. And it's another area where the

 unemployment. We still see non-farm payrolls growing. So the interest rate impact has not fed through to the business cycle yet. We're going to have to see job destruction if we're really going to see inflation be curtailed. And I think that's hard because we've gone through a lot of fundamental changes in this country. Prior to COVID, we were all talking about the aging

 people from the labor force, either through long COVID or unfortunately, they passed away, which is a horrible event. But we've got to recognize we've lost people from the labor force. And then we had a bunch of people sort of late in their work cycle who decided to leave the labor force. So we've now have a smaller labor force population in

. So businesses to attract workers into the labor force are having to pay more to get workers in the cycle, which is inflationary. Wages go up. They pass those increased wages onto the consumers. And we're in this inflationary cycle. So the feds are going to continue to keep raising rates to try and break this cycle. They won't know they have broken it until long after it's broken. So what does this mean then for the equity markets? Because here we stand

We again, it's like everything else in this world. We won't know we've met that clearing price till long after the bottom is here. We may have met it already. A lot of people think we have not got to that clearing price, but the market right now is trying to figure out what future earnings look like and what multiple we should put on that.

 administration was sending out stimulus checks and they're putting money in the hands of consumers, we were increasing the money supply. As you increase the money supply, you've got dollars chasing goods, those dollars are willing to chase the price of goods higher and higher. So we clearly saw some inflationary pressure from the consumer being in a very good position, having very, very good balance sheets unlevered. And by the way, we still see that

 consumer with a very good balance sheet, still have the ability to spend. And that clearly is part of the cause of the inflation. We also had a situation where you could talk about the supply side. We had a change in energy policy, a fairly dramatic change in energy policy, energy policy, drove a lot of this. We've clearly had some unforeseen weather events around the world in the food. We clearly have a war in

 jump and viewership there that I just mentioned in the intro. What do you attribute this to? Part of it is when, if you build it, they will come. So one of the things we've done, more marketing, more digital, meet our fan where they are. Our fans use more diverse, our fans use younger, more women. And so finding that fan, bringing them in, retaining them in the game, getting them to games, getting fans and seats. We come off to tough COVID years for

. We're deploying that capital against things like digital and marketing and telling player stories and the players. The on-the-court records, triple doubles, double doubles. A sightment of the game is really driving it as well. I want to talk a little bit more about that capital raise in

. When you're looking for that next media agreement, what are you hoping or what do you want that agreement to include? Again, I think we're going to look at all different forms of how to bring the game to our fan base who does skew younger. And really, if you think about how it's being disrupted, it's also around marketing so people know where to find you and making the friction out of viewing a game for the fan. They have to know where to go on the spot, or they're going to lose interest. And they also the content around it, not just the game itself. And we're

 and you're done. So it's not our games are quite fast. But it's the content around it and the storytelling around it and the medium and short form content that's going to drive, I think, viewers in to determine how we think about media going forward. You mentioned that

And I guess if it is already underway, how that's progressing. Yeah, so it's just underway. We just finished our season. Just handed out that trophy to

 players under contract to market the league in the off season. And it's going to be great. We've already had a couple of the players at the league office to talk to them about what this all means, how to build their brands, and drive them into the next generation of household names in the sport. So, and there's such great role models for young boys and girls. It's not just young girls, it's young boys too. And a lot of people I meet say, the

 basketball game I want to take my kid to is a WMBA game, the pure form of the sport. So these players are great role models. Obviously, they're very strong social justice stances. And people view them as these kind of multi-dimensional role models. And we have moms in the league. And they're really great role models. So that's why we want to market the players more and spend a lot more of that capital on the players themselves.

 viewership, current W, merch buying. You can get a lot of data by city to determine which cities would be the best. We have to find committed ownership groups with a greater rena situation. So there's a lot to think about. But that's certainly one of the areas now that the hard work starts in the off season around strategizing around those cities.

I guess what's your reaction to that and whether or not the president should be more forceful in pressing this issue? Yeah, I think from our discussions with the administration, they're trying everything they can do to get a deal done. Obviously the legal process we knew was not going to yield a favorable answer to

But as I mentioned, if you think of diplomatically, geopolitically, even if you had a neutral party step in, there's no easy answer here.

. And so, you know, I recently got a nice big chunky check by you. And you know, I want to pick up on that point because, you know, streaming has really appended the industry. And how are you talking about those contracts? Like you were saying, redoing all those contracts to account for streaming? Yeah, you know, we just have a very successful negotiation with

 negotiation. The union was talking about, for me, what sounded like incremental alterations to an existing contract. And I saw a convergence of opportunities that would probably not come along for a very long time that needed to be leveraged with a great deal of strengths and conviction right now, or forever, be chasing after a different kind of a contract that's always just outside of our grasp. We really used our legislation that we had in the state of

 to meet as well. And we were very lucky that they heard us. They understood that we were the undead dogs in this equation. They felt the truth of the matter is that when an entire industry changes and the rules of the game change on behalf of the employer, changes are going to have to trickle down to the employee as well. You can't have it both ways. I want to pick up on that point too because you know, we know about all the big players in

And people hadn't been theaters in a long time, too. No, it's a big entertaining movie with great cast, great people behind the camera,

They had to know where the sun was because they had to match other aerial stuff that we did. So it was really an exhilarating and scary proposition and they were beat up.

Well, and kind of to that end, you know, those in a theater really plays particularly well, right? Like the intimacy of those shots, right? Are you really see their eyes? Do you think that's part of why people were so excited to see it in theaters? Absolutely. I think the fact that we did it for real obviously, the explosions and other things we couldn't do for real. But what's really the reason that people have gone back multiple times is the emotion. It's about the emotion and following these characters and watching

I just got to make movies that embrace an audience. And unfortunately the pandemic we weren't making a lot of movies that really could play in theaters. Streaming has its place, theaters have its place. I always use the analogy. You have a kitchen, right? But you like to go out to eat. So it's not always you want to stay home and watch something on television. It's a group experience. It's exhilarating when you go to opening weekend and people are cheering and applauding for the right type of movie. And that's what happened with Top Gun. I went

And there's an audience at home, and there's an audience that leaves home and goes to the theater. But top gun is a movie. You really have to go see it in a theater. I mean, it's done phenomenal and streaming so far. It's been just great. I think it's the number

 Plus. It obviously has a linear service. It has a well-developed brand. And we're happy with how it's doing on a standalone basis. A while ago, we introduced a price bundle, which was you can have

 Plus stuff really works. So again, what are we focused on now? We're focused on how do we make a more compelling consumer proposition and how does that aid in getting distributors even more behind our product. So we look at it optionality. And I don't know exactly where it's going to go, but I can tell you our product will continue to get stronger. It will continue to evolve and that will bring down churn and it will continue to grow the sub base. Are you using those bundled offerings that you were just talking about as a sort of test to see what a combination service could bring in the market? Well, absolutely. We're getting more data every day on

 Plus on the standalone, what works under the covers, how does sports content interact with films, etc. We're seeing how the bundle performs on a price basis. We can look at variability in pricing. So yeah, we learn more about streaming 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #bfe1d9; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

 and that informs our going forward plan. You mentioned pricing. I want to pick up on that. Pricing has gone up for a lot of these streaming competitors. We got the news recently that the

</mark>
. Where's that sweet spot for you when we think about pricing relative to competitors, but also wanting to make sure that you're not leading to increased churn? Yeah, sure. So a couple points on pricing. One is streaming represents an extraordinary value in general for the consumer. Point 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #e4e7d2; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

 is in general, and you've already seen the start to happen, streaming pricing is going to go up.

 has raised price multiple times. So the price umbrella on streaming will go up and we'll tuck in under that and we will raise price as well. Can't tell exactly when that'll happen, but directly it's going to happen for sure. So do you say you're watching competitors pretty closely when it comes to their pricing? Does that factor into your decisions? We look at a lot of things. We look at the performance of our product, with our consumers, we look what competitors are doing, the obviously look at what's going on outside of streaming. All that gets factored into our decision making on our course of action for streaming and the business at large. And when we think about content, you were mentioning sports content, obviously

How do you determine which film can go direct to the theater or which film you might want to go direct to streaming on

 in day on streaming. We said no. We believe in the theatrical window. And we believe in it both to give the audience the chance to have that big screen experience and participate in those economics. And then we can move to streaming. So we adopted what's known as a theatrical and

 times. Because we said this is a big screen movie and it should be in the theaters. And I'm glad we did, because that turned out to be a good call. I think the theatrical with

. So at having a longer theatrical run makes sense. But in general, we like that strategy. I think that's the sweet spot of ROI, particularly with respect to films. And that is very much our going forward strategy with

 with respect to equity valuations, and certainly our company stock. Worth noting on a relative basis, relative to some other media companies, we've actually done better, i.e. less worse. But nonetheless, there are concerns on the street, there's concerns relative to topics. My view is you have to decide what you believe in and play through.

So you have a lot of insight into corporate spending on technology right now because they are business to business largely. What are you seeing right now? What are you hearing from your companies, from your clients and does it feel like from where you sit that we are on the cusp of a

? Yeah, great, great set of questions. I think importantly, you know, enterprise software still is viewed as the most productive tool introduced in the business economy last 50 years like it will be for

. So we're seeing some slow down in certain sectors and frankly, acceleration in others. Things like low code, no code, environments, things for productivity, you know, things for anything around, you know, cyber security to protect the enterprise. Those are sorts of dynamics that we're seeing. So am I seeing a broad slow down across our platform? No. Are we seeing some pockets where we actually see it? Yes. Typically, those will be in any of the B to B to see, any of those consumer oriented businesses you'll see a little more slow down. You're not seeing people buying as much in the future as they used to, which you saw in some of the

 and some of their numbers, et cetera. Where some of the companies that we focus on really, you know, this mission critical, you know, a business critical enterprise software continues to be in demand and robust demand for the most part. Is there a point you see in the future? Is there a point typically in these kinds of cycles where you do start to see that pullback? I mean, to be fair, when we were in the financial crisis in that

, the enterprise software industry was not as developed as it is now. So I'm not sure we have a perfect analog. But what are you expecting to see? Great, great analysis. So if you look at

And so the utilization rates of them has actually been enhanced. The other thing that's actually quite interesting is the productivity dynamic. As you know, in the

. Are your portfolio companies doing any kind of preemptive batting down the hatches, so to speak, any kind of cutting and spending or hiring freezes, et cetera? Yeah, not at this point. I mean, there's a few that actually, you know, who have a little more consumer, like I call a little more consumer facing orientation who have to think about, okay, you know, are we overbuilding in our sales capacity or development capacity? But for the most part, the company is we bi, typically, you know, have a massive ROI. I think I told you, we talked about this before. Our average company, the products they sell to their customers is a

But, you know, it was a fully underwritten deal, fully priced from our perspective, and they go through distribution.

 so lenders to now about 30 or 40 in that space. And so, you may have to go to a few more, but we still see the ability to get deals like no before done, Avallara done in these private markets, as opposed to relying on syndicated debt markets.

. So you guys have still been busy. I'm curious which advice to retail investors would be when it comes to tech stocks, right? You obviously see some good valuations still out there. Do you think that retail investors should be looking at tech stocks, right? Well, I like to say, you know, not all tech stocks, of course, are created equal. You know, enterprise software, you know, if you look at the earnings of a lot of the enterprise software companies, they actually are holding up pretty well. Now, there's stocks continue to get hammered for a couple of, you know, call it, you know, technical reasons. And then there's a lot of part of which is they get pulled down by the consumer and the internet stocks. And you have, you know, people who are, you know, institutional investors, crossover investors who are creating public books. And those public books, they had, you know, consumer internet and enterprise. And if the consumer and internet books are down

, and they, you know, levered that book up, they've got to meet those margin calls. Well, how do you do that? You sell them to strength. So you're selling it into the enterprise businesses that have the flow, have the capacity, et cetera. You know, our market is really interesting one because we're still, you know,

We really would like to buy and now have become what I'll call more affordable for the type of underwriting that we do. Where we can bring our value creation metrics to it. Let's switch gears a little bit. I want to talk about more

? I do. I think we need to rethink what it is that we want in our economy. We want productive students. We want them to be able to increase their quality and standard of life, and relative to their parents. Everyone wants to see that level of improvement. And look, not all kids need to go to college in order to create a very productive standard of living. So I think we have to be thoughtful about that. I think the universities have to be, think about being responsible delivers of high value education that can be used in work environments or entrepreneurial settings as part of what their relationship is with the customer there being the student. The student freedom initiative, which we set up as basically a fund, that, in essence, these students, they borrow money from so they can hopefully offset what I call the acute pain of parent plus loans, which I saw was pretty acute to the students in more house. But when they pay it back, they actually pay it back into the fund that gets re-lent to the next generation of students. We focus on

. Now we know that you have also pushed hard for these sanctions as well, but by all accounts, yes, it's affecting the economy, but it's not deterring

 at the moment. What if anything would dampen his resolve at this point? What would dampen his resolve your right is not going to be sanctions. What sanctions are going to do is what you mentioned earlier, squeezing the economy, sanctions make it more difficult for the

 to be able to replace all these weapons, all these missiles, all these cruise missiles, and guided missiles and airstrikes, all of those things cost money and all of those things need to be replaced.
