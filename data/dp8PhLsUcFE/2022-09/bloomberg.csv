It's gonna make sure that we have a clear view on short and long term synergies and so forth. And then we both talk to shareholders and to investors to explain what we're doing and why we're doing it and why it's good. Shareholders have reason to appreciate MasterCard's capital allocation strategy. It's included annual share Insteadly increased dividends. Prioritize the amount of money that you put toward innovation and toward building out different businesses versus share buybacks and dividends because master card is traditionally had a robust program in rewarding shareholders. Right. The business. And returning excess cash to shareholders with a bias to a share buybacks. And then once you start to come to say I have dealt with my strategic priorities I either have invested in my organic roles or in acquisitions then access cash we will return back Leave with a preference for buybacks over dividend because it gives a small flexibility but that's been a good model for us.

It's really made a difference. What is really made a difference on has been in terms of how it's driving a shift from cash to electronic payment. Particularly on the small ticket items.

Transaction Which we make revenue. On which we can deliver services and that's really important. Introduced PayPal it's first contact list payment system in 2002 but the technology took some time to gain traction I would say we first invested in this many many many years ago the adoption rate on this in the early part even in Marcus like the UK Canada Australia was fairly soon the early part the inflection point of when It really started to go ahead and straight was when it was used in the transit vertical.

Serial clean tech entrepreneur Val Miftoff started oh avia following his previous success in the EV charging industry So the beauty about In general is that the energy density of hydrogen is fuel is is actually three times better than jet fuel so you can see Any size of aircraft For any distance that jet fuel aircraft can go overtime right it will just take significant amount of time to get the industry over but this technology can scale to all sizes of aircraft that we use in commercial service Oh Avia uses a hydrogen fuel cell to produce electricity to turn a propeller. I'm like a traditional engine which uses combustion to create energy. A fuel cell generates electricity Electrochemical reaction In this case, hydrogen and oxygen are combined to generate electricity, heat, and water.

Obviously you're gonna have to take out some seats because they energy density of hydrogen is less than jet fuel and you can't store it in the wings practically so you're gonna have to take away some space in the fuse lads In the ultra fine margins of aviation removing 10 to 20% of your seats is a tough ask. But that hasn't deterred startups like oh Avia or universal hydrogen. The maintenance cause of a fuel cell motor system Down and it goes down significantly because motors and fuel cells have much fewer moving parts than a gasturbine engine.

Bernie. The first hurricane moment I suppose is when we saw steam and the exhaust because we are thinking to ourselves how we're burning something here when you're producing absolutely no COtwo. An expert in gastrobine combustion professor Bobby Saty leads research a cranfield university in the UK. Built on a former RAF base the college runs multiple aeronautical programs But what Bobby is focused on is burning hydrogen as cleanly as possible. So what we are trying to demonstrate in this rig is how we can conceive some hydrogen combustion technologies that can be integrated in the next generation aircraft engines which will deliver not only low oh COtwo emissions but also ultralonox emission Knox or nitrogen oxides are a significant source of air pollution globally There are the dirty particulates that cause smog in cities Spat out by diesel cars, scooters, and buses. Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flowability limits which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn it much lower flame temperatures and that's a better for a nuising oxymissions. Going leaner means burning fuel with an excess of air in the engine using something like gasoline Far fewer hydrocarbons. Doing it with hydrogen also delivers cleaner emissions.

5568,"However, initial cost are daunting but time may be the best remedy here. If you look at economics of hydrogen fuel production for example versus fossil fuels for instance The cost of hydrogen is old based on capital expense and very little operating expenses sort of similar to solar power, right? You put solar panels out there and they they produce power for 2025 years. The operating expenses relatively low. What that means is that as scale grows as we've seen with the solar panels, the Drops dramatically. So the first phase is not about the most efficient aircraft it's not about the aircraft that will deliver the lowest oxymissions it's about demonstrating that we can carry hydrogen safely on board we can burn it safely on board and can be used to fly passenger aircraft The key thing is that we don't try to put everything in the first generation or we'll just gonna delay the entry to service. So to try and keep it as simple as possible. If there are some questions on the margin they're all in a sort of business model and market option realm.

Most of the time the barrier stays open so ships can pass through. When a storm comes along it snaps shut Preventing the storm surge from traveling up river to flooding waterdale. The movable design was radical when it was completed in 1997. And it's inspired similar structures in flip prone cities around the world. If you look at some Petersboro and Russia a small version of this barrier has been made over there. And maybe in the future in front of Manhattan, they're thinking about a way to protect that also. So this was the first one and how smaller versions are coming all over the world. But the barrier on its own isn't enough to keep water dam from flooding.

Cereal clean tech entrepreneur Val Myftoff started oh avia following his previous success in the EV charging industry So the beauty about hydrogen in general is that the energy density of hydrogen is fuel is is actually three times better than jet fuel so you can see Any size of aircraft going for any distance that jet fuel aircraft can go over time. Right? It will just take significant amount of time to get the industry over but this technology can scale to all sizes of aircraft that we use in commercial service. Oh Avia uses a hydrogen fuel cell to produce electricity to turn a propeller. Unlike a traditional engine which uses combustion to create energy. A fuel cell generates electricity Through electrochemical reaction. Hydrogen and oxygen are combined to generate electricity, heat, and water.

Obviously you're gonna have to take out some seats because the energy density of hydrogen is less than jet fuel and you can't store it in the wings practically so you're gonna have to take away some space in the fuse lads In the ultra fine margins of aviation removing 10 to 20% of your seats is a tough ask Hydrogen.

An expert in gas turbine combustion professor Bobby Saty leads research at Cranfield University in the UK. Built on a former RAF base the college runs multiple aeronautical programs But what Barbie is focused on is burning hydrogen as cleanly as possible So what we are trying to demonstrate in this rig is how we can conceive some hydrogen combustion technologies that can be integrated in the next generation aircraft engines which will deliver not only low oh COtwo emissions but also ultranox emission Knocks or nitrogen oxides are a significant source of air pollution globally. They're the dirty particulars that cause smog in cities. Spat out by diesel cars, scooters, and buses. Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flamility limits which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn it much lower flame temperatures and that's a better for inducing ox emissions.

5664,"To make green hydrogen the electricity used to run the electrolyzer must come from a renewable resource which is currently a lot more expensive. As with any new technology, however, initial cost are daunting but time may be the best remedy here. If you look at economics of hydrogen fuel production for example versus fossil fuels for instance the cost of hydrogen is all based on capital expense and very little operating expenses sort of similar to solar power, right? You put solar panels out there and they they produce power for 2020- The operating expenses relatively low what that means is that as scale grows as we've seen with the solar panels they cost off outputs drops dramatically. So the first phase is not about the most efficient aircraft it's not about the aircraft that will deliver the lowest oxymissions. It's about demonstrating that we can carry hydrogen safely on board. We can't burn it safely on board and can be used to fly passenger aircraft The key thing is that we don't try to put everything in the first generation or we'll just gonna delay the entry to service. So it's trying to keep it as simple as possible.

For instance, in the infrastructure law you had support for EV charging, and an EVs, and and transportation here, you have additional credits, for electric vehicles, vet, come with some Again there's just these these two laws are really complimentary the infrastructure law really laid a base of funding for some of these endeavors and yet left left the door open for others so the law that just passed include Text credits for hydrogen projects that really were left out of that first infrastructure law.

It gets rid of a lot of the noise and competition You know, there are great opportunities to support people who just be good public surfing. So, you support people both parties. Yeah. Okay? And today you would not consider running for office yourself, right? I I would be an insane thing for me to do as a fourth job to tack on to you know the other things I'm doing.

It's not long. Biggest step forward on our climate ever. So yeah, it's called the inflation reduction act but it's impact on our climate. It's arguably bigger than its potential impact on inflation. The bill contains 374 1 billion Climate versions. That includes 60 1 billion in tax credits for queen energy manufacturing and 30 1 billion in tax credits for wind and solar power. It also includes incentives for Americans to buy new and second hand electric cars and also for those who use heat pumps to warm their homes. Republicans criticize Bill saying it could mean higher taxes and higher energy bills for consumers to get it over Victory for the president especially ahead of the November midterm elections. So press and invite and has taken a big step to address the climate crisis in the US but let's take more into the details joining us now is Jennifer DeLoe our energy and environmental policy reporter in Washington DC so Jennifer let's just Very high level.

5731,"Initiatives that are already had been passed earlier this year Yeah, great question. A lot of this is layered on top of that spending. For instance, in the infrastructure law, you had support for EV charging and an EV's and and transportation. Here, you have additional credits. For electric vehicles, Enable more purchases over you know at the long term again there's just these these two laws are really complimentary the infrastructure law really laid a base of funding for some of these endeavors and yet left left the door open further so the Just passed includes tax credits for hydrogen projects that really were left out of that first infrastructure law. One of the reasons frankly that senator Joe Mansion wanted to push this thing ahead. Well, on that point, Jennifer, for a long time, we didn't even know if another bill was going to happen. The fate of this climate bill looked, looked very uncertain, and then Out of the woodwork come Senator Joe Mansion having slammed the brakes on the legislation before but we now understand that that is when billionaire and clean energy investor Bill Gates decided Get involved. He jumped on a phone call with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to discuss the bill and had Quietly campaigning for years lobbying mansion and other senators on the climate issue so that gave him reason to believe that the sen From West Virginia would come through in the end. We spoke with him. Take a listen to what he had to say about it. We were able to talk even at a time when he felt Weren't listening You know I wouldn't have wanted to be in his position you know the last 6 months have been Challenging.

5733,"Ethan what's first begin with what the ultimate goal is and that is 50 Reduction from 2005 levels in carbon emissions by 2030. The numbers looking at the contents of this legislation How close are we gonna get to that? Well unfortunately the answer is we'll see. Because unlike other policies this one was not written with a hard COtwo goal included in it. There's no carbon price. There's not a cap in trade market. So there's not a specific goal legislated here that we're trying to achieve. But I do think Generally reasonable there are many reasons many many factors that could impact whether the US actually does cut emissions 40% by 2030. We might even do better than that. It's certainly Possible. We might do a little bit worse. There are a lot of factors that play and not all of them are directly involved with the energy sector. Obviously, how quick the economy grows has an enormous amount to do with whatever's overall COtwo emissions pathways Okay so there is some room for error and even in the best case scenario in a perfect world where everything goes according to Plan there's still a golf between what the actual 2030 goal is and what we think this bill may be able to provide in the best case scenario Given what isn't in the bill how else are we gonna get to that Extra 10% we need Get well. Good question. Although, I would say that, you know, there's there's not much, there's not that much that is not in the bill. It's worth, you know, recognizing that what was achieved. First of all, it was pretty monumental and second of all, was actually the abs Maximum that was possible under the political circumstances. I hear in the US tax credits have historically been the policy mechanism of choice for subsidizing, supporting the clean energy industry, and that was exactly what occurred here is ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,280,2022-09-04 14:50:57

Either through trees, natural means, or direct air capture, which is what they call mechanical trees. All told, the speed and scale plan takes us from oh to 59 gigatons 2050 and importantly halfway there by 2030 we have just seven and a half years to get this done in time and so the plan includes four accelerance.

Who's watching Europe and Latin America and particular Me up next we got a preview of the RBO decision with AMP's Diana Messina she thinks it's such a big maintaining the rage when it comes to great hikes this is Bloomberg Vietnamese consumers are very aspirational. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,383,2022-09-04 22:21:00
5837,If we get the right hike tomorrow then we would have had 225 base points since May which is the most aggressive rate hike. Cycle that we've seen since 994. And the RBA is still very concerned about the inflation outlook here which is why I think that they will continue to raise rates quite aggressively Tomorrow and then also over the over the coming months. Let's take a look at this chart which kind of you know cos I've got some questions when it comes to the true resilience of the labor market and also what we're seeing when it comes to wage price growth as well what would the RBA be watching here given that we have seen a pretty reasonable piece of wage growth? Well I don't think that wages growth is actually particularly strong or As strong as the RB would have liked to have seen The moment we've got a very tight labor market the lowest unemployment rate nearly 50 years but wages growth is still stuck at under three% on an annual basis if we look globally wages growth in the US is five or six% on an annual basis in similar in the UK and in Europe the IBA keeps telling us We'll pick up from here. That's right that it will just take a bit longer to come through but my concern is that we're not going to see the level of wages growth that the RBA is forecasting or expecting and that you'll continue to see this very aggressive rate hikes and a lot of pressure put on borrowers and on households but the wages growth is not going to be there so you're actually going to see ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,384,2022-09-04 22:25:26
5838,Again as I said to Heidi before there is this concept of lagging data so I I think that We'll probably Through the data a little bit and just continue on its aggressive rate hike cycle because I do think that they are worried that inflation expectations can get out of control a little bit in the US and and globally and there are reasons to be worried about wage price spirals emerging in the US and inflation getting too high so I think that we are going to see another 75 basis point hike from them Deanna always great to have you with us here down at Messina Senior Academy Here on Debreck Australia this is Bloomberg.

Maybe I'll go and do a little bit So I know you've been looking at these things very closely Start start with busted European convertible bonds. What makes them so attractive right now? What is it about what's happening in their region and even globally? Sure and I think European credit generally has been hit by a perfect storm European credit has been trading at a pretty material discount to US credit or a number of macro economic issues that are affecting Europe specifically on top of that you have equity market valuations that are down very significantly and European companies that are perfectly good businesses took advantage of very low interest rates the issue very low coupon convertible bonds as a result of interest rates going up macro economic conditions and Europe and a Equity market valuations it's create a perfect storm and we've had the opportunity to look for and buy many very attractive businesses in Europe that generate good cash flow that have good modes have sustainable businesses and really we can create these capital structures at material discounts to what So happy to go into a few examples on those.

Aaron that's a really great summary of your approach I'm wondering that convergence of all those factors how does that play out in the Japanese market for you Sure Japan is very interesting and and just on our strategy and approach we really are We try to find an opportunity Weather equity or credit where it's clear that it's orphaned and what's been so attractive to us about Japan for many years is you really have credit like downside protection I should say given how how tough prep market has been through credit a true credit like downside protect Where you have businesses that have plenty of cash that traded very distressed multiples because most analysts feel that certain companies in Japan aren't able to change and we've been pretty excited about again being able to buy great businesses at very very attractive prices and having multiple ways to win and so ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,390,2022-09-04 22:51:21
