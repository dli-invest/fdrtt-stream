We got the news it wouldn't after gas markets closed on Friday or least the the European benchmarks closed. That's feeding through the commodities across the board. Two other themes. They're generally in Asia. It More about the European story US was closed. So, overall in Asia, it's been kind of mixed across the equities column Note the dollar much stronger again led by the Yuan weakness that's feeding through the Asian currencies emerge market currency across the board and of course that strong dollar is a tightening of financial conditions it's not just Both of your and the pound shop and that screen for the wrong reasons and again we're seeing a little bit of softness in some of the bondmark bond yields today but nothing major.

I think those kind of themes can continue. And we've talked about this. A couple of times over the last few months that this would be the big theme this year And that perhaps the easiest way to play it going into the final last few months might be a short European equities because the Euro is gonna remain two-way volatility because we're gonna get the occasional yield spiked on the back And of course that place into the ECB this week will they cut more than hike more than expected because they're a little worried about inflation or they hike less than expected because they're At the growth story. And that's what makes a complicated on the currency side as well. But it's not just the FX, the bonds, the the equities markets. It's also things like commodities markets. We are hearing about the idea that Aluminium Smelters, for example, getting Off and this might drive up the price of metals prices. So, I think this really feeds it to every aspect of markets and of course, this meaning that some factors get shut off. Means that they're certainly gonna be credits gonna As well there's gonna be defaults in the back of this cos Bill won't be able to afford these bills. So literally every aspect of the market in Europe is affected by this.

Thank you. Thank you for having me. I mean it is interesting. I know Mark was making these comments earlier There's a lot of pessimism priced into the UK which is at the moment. All the risk factors associated with the trust administration seemed to be very much at the forefront of people's minds. You've just highlighted defects sterling had the worst weeks and said 2016. Borrowing costs guilt yield. Add AA significant spread to European bond deal All the risks have been priced in and yet very few of the positives. I mean a trust administration there is a very clear immediate positive. If she does reverse or not walk through the corporation tax rises. That is an immediate upgrade to UK earnings immediately upgrade to UK earnings. The NHI postponement or delay of the NHI rise. Or cancellation that again is a positive for the UK consumer and then finally from specific stock perspectives if she is reluctant to go ahead with the windfall tax as we obviously see Germany impose more with all taxes over the weekend If she doesn't impose any windfall taxes then that's a clear positive to energy and utilities and ready to companies. So I think you're right. I think the market has tended to focus on the risk and and not potentially on the positives today. Okay.

I think it's I think whenever we talk about UK produce it's pretty difficult because the footsy obviously as you well know is is so Visited towards so concentrated towards energy producers and quantity producers that you know age strong energy price obviously distorts the footsy performance I think if you looked at the 250 the two 50s perform pretty much in line with the Euro stocks over the last couple of weeks so I think the issues are so homogeneous across Europe that I would struggle to make a call between say the 250 versus some of the European domestic indigenous we have to believe though that the footsea after years of under performance given just given it structural exposure to some of the sectors that are benefiting From this energy crisis you have to believe that foots is going to outperform. What's your base case original as we as we look ahead into the winter what looks to be a pretty dark winter what is your base case for the European economy for the UK economy are we we're Recessions would they be long will they be deep what are you expecting? Well I think our forecast are generally speaking that we're expecting recessions. Now whether they are deep or whether they are shallow I think is is the really important point going forward. And that depends on a number of factors. It depends mostly on you know what is the government's both in Europe and Response to this energy crisis also determines what's the between the demand destruction that is never to becomes from higher energy prices with soaring inflation and the need to raise interest rates so it's a very fine balance the central bankers are faced with but it is the same challenge It's the ECB or whether it's the bank of England.

The first order of business would be to do something about the cost of living crisis. What We expect to hear come Tuesday. We do have to talk about Liz Trust though it's not a done deal yet I mean obviously she has to come in and as Lizzy has made some very good points there about the challenges that face but obviously the big challenge is in a time of inflation particularly what to do about energy prices and I think that while she is a supporter of the small And she started off the campaign. Very cautious about supporting households and businesses. She's been converted now and I think that we are going to see a significant package of short term support. The precise form of it. We don't But I think it's coming. So the Europeans are in the form of the EU were talking about a cap on gas prices.

The argument for putting up rates even at a time when maybe the consumer is going to be is already going to be struggling with higher energy bills.

Over the next 12 months or so. The problem is then it goes much deeper than just commodity prices. This inflation rate problem that we're seeing particularly in in in the UK and to an also in the US for for different reasons. Because of the the destruction of supply and the kind of demand over hang leftover by stimulus in the So it's not so simple as saying okay we've got gonna have commodity disinflation because of you know the comparisons with the previous year get easier so if we stayed at these levels it's It's not possible to say that that's inflation sort of back down to more normal levels. It will still be elevated because of what services side of the economy now picking up the bat on. Exactly which is why we're calling it a disinflation mirage assuming that it does come through in the supply side doesn't throw up any kind of farther rate increase in income prices in in any significant sense. It's it's if it's the driven by commodities it's it's very much a mirage of disinflation because underneath that Stella demand supply mismatch in the US and particularly within Europe the UK are doing extent within the Euro area but Europe that Europe is outside of the UK is is quite lucky to have received quite AA reasonable rebounding in in participation and labor supply ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,553,2022-09-05 10:43:43

I don't know whether it's African, how much we have to pay for it. We can buy a limited amount of other countries. USA is the one that's really stepped in to ship record amounts of LNG Possibly Atlantic but there were capacity constraints. There's only so much energy that the US can ship because there are any saying the export terminals in America and there's only so much LNG that Europe can import because it it has the terminals but not in all the right places. Germany, for example, will not get any LNG Port capacity until later this winter when it puts a temporary facility in so it's it's difficult and it's especially difficult for Germany. So well do we have a European plan on how to deal with this? Not yet. But it's humming. There are plans. Obviously there's been a plan to reduce consumption for some time but I think we're gonna Phoenix celebration those plans energy ministers meet on Friday and there are clearly quite radical proposals on the table A to reduce demand to make this winter more manageable but second to alleviate the Pressure on consumers and businesses inside Europe.

They're pivot into rent. Those kind of payments. Which are most important for them to meet. But the real still stay the same. So the real which run debit and credit are exactly the same.

On which we can deliver services and that's really important MasterCard introduced PayPal it's first contact list payment system in 2002 but the technology took some time to gain traction I would say we first invested in this many, many, many, many years ago. The adoption rate on this in the early part. Even in markets like the UK, Canada, Australia, was belly slow in the early part. The inflection point of when It really started to hit it straight was when it was used in the transit vertical. So what we figured is let's get on the transit systems around the globe. Enable for contactless technology. That will create muscle memory for the consumer who will like the experience and transit elsewhere. How do you judge the revenue proposition for Mastercard with innovation like that and the adoption and the pace of it? Look, I mean, for us, we're agnostic as the weather. Somebody's using the chip technology or the contact list technology or you know, using the MagStripe which was the old way of doing business.

The revenue potential and upside for us comes from the fact that now more spend is being done on card based on supreme and then was being done in the past.

For the battery at this point. So, we are investing a ton into battery So around us we got the testing We're also building a new manufacturing cell manufacturing test facility where we're gonna test different ways of manufacturing cells cuz it's one thing to look at chemistry and say this is superior but can you replicate it ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,685,2022-09-05 20:19:09
