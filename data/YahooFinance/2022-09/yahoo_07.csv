I do think that over the winter commodities are gonna be a huge wildcard. You know, we've seen that July In the S and P 500. And I think that's been proven out because policy is still uncertain. The economy is still uncertain. And commodities really amplify that. We've had this decline for now but given the really low growth trajectory, Active oil is still where it is. Below where it was, right? But i think without Russia and Ukraine conflict, oil would be more like $70 a bar and not where it is today.

16,Say we have argue that US economy can achieve a soft landing even though the path is narrow what's your view just on the fed being able to navigate a soft landing at this Yeah I think the odds are probably one and three chances at this point and that's instinct with what Goldman has been saying given the ISM service data being stronger than expected but jobs numbers from last week also better than expected Is a buffer for the fed to continue to raise interest rates without Yeah knocking the economy back into recession so I think at this point the odds about one to three is is reasonable certainly as we get more data points that number certainly move quite a bit And Amy as you talk about the about that buffer there. How does the housing and rental sector play into that? It's a great question. I think as the affordability index for the real estate market continues to decline lower given that mortgage rates have shot higher quite a bit. I think the rental market is something where going to watch quite quite closely. You're you're seeing that on a month over month Increasing maybe half per percentage point but that may continue to be AA factor of YCPI numbers can stay elevated because again those leases are going to start to roll over into higher numbers as the as the real estate market continues to become less and less of affordable. Much more on the rental market across the country later in the show. What can be the next catalyst to move these markets back in the other direction?

Earnings here for the third quarter and then of course looking out to 2023 Morgan Sandley's Mike Wilson he was out with a note saying that in 2023 he expects profits to fall three% even in the absence of an economic recession I guess how Of a of a drop do you think we could potentially say You know, at this point, given the future earning season, the market is still expecting eight% growth rate for SMP 500 earnings. I think that is likely to move lower as we head into the Q, three earning season of course into the Year when companies can can report food here as well as 2023 guidance and so I think at this. Eight% broke is still pretty high I would expect something maybe low single digits to be probably the base case from what we're seeing given some of the management commentaries we've heard Alright, Amy calling always great to have you.

Of course, California's been moving very quickly in the direction of of clean energy which makes it so that when solar production begins to taper off in the in the evening hours, you begin to see tighter supplies. It's also been retiring more conventional power plants. In recent years. Now, of course, Climate change heat waves like this are becoming more severe and that you know creates AA challenge of managing demand. So there's a lot going on.

So as we look at some of the work that needs to be done what do we know about sort of the funding behind some of these projects really find reinforce the grid and really improve California's chances going forward Right? California have big capital spending plans if they're trying to push forward to help do two things to prepare the grid for this greater electricity demand. Not only with electric vehicles but also efforts to electric fire homes, phase out natural gas, Trying to you know make large investments and And do spending that will reduce wildfire risks.

The reality is you have a lot of technical teams of a lot of running a lot of tests. They've done a lot of what are called test snaps and so it's probably going to be fine but it's gonna change fundamentally how the network works and that's gonna have a big impact Ecosystem and it's uncertain how that's gonna go but it could be really good if it all goes well. That's a big gift cuz this is it's going to be happening live so a lot of people wondering that proof of steak, proof of work, the differences there. I know that it's gonna make a big difference when it To minus what are some of the other key differences that come with the match So, there's a few probably, I guess we could break it down into three areas. So, the first is just from the standpoint of environmental. I mean, we've had a big concern kind of from the whole ESG community Around issues of kind of the energy consumption involved in mining and so that's gonna go away the energy consumption will drop by orders of magnitude so that's you know positive Are a lot of security changes that this is bringing about with it and if you understand the way that blockchain networks work the key thing that they're doing is keeping your data secure. Right? There are security trade offs that come with this in one hand it is certainly more secure from certain types of attacks and certain type of attack of actors so that's a positive thing but there are as I said trade offs there's other types of attacks that are Potentially a bigger vulnerabilities and because of the fact that this hasn't been tested at this scale before there's uncertainty about how those things will play at so it's the second thing the third thing that's really important is the insurance rate of the underlying ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,91,2022-09-06 20:13:53
32,"For somebody who doesn't have it already I tend to be quite bullish on the changes that we'll see over time. The example I always give people is look at viruses in kind of the windows 2000 windows XP days. They were terrible, right? For a lot of years you Just one piece of malware after another That was a problem that we're able to solve with technology because it turns out that the vulnerabilities become somewhat predictable, somewhat repetitive, and you learn to develop best practice Where we can datamind all kinds of things and build Algorithms that are gonna allow us to self drive etcetera. So, when you can take that kind of automation, not a time of technology, it's one of the things we're doing it. Defy yield, my company, Basically Build almost a smart contract antiviruses then you're gonna be in a position where I think you can clean up a lot of that so we're in the early days and the fact that we have seen so many acts and so many scams and so much Is a sign of that but I think that given time we're going to address these things and so probably 10 years from now just like nowadays what was the last big virus or piece of malware that you heard about on windows or OSX You don't hear about them. It's probably the same as gonna be true in crypto at web 310 years from now. We know that a lot of retail investors really looking for sort of some of these high yield returns but we saw sort of the downfall of that things like voyager, some of these other Act like CD accounts.

34,"For Ukraine so that consumers in the West basically say I can't take it anymore I can't take this high energy prices we've got to make some deal with Russia even it if it requires selling out Ukraine that's what Putin wants and we need to be on alert to that here in the West because he exactly that is exactly what Putin is trying to do is cause so much pain Among consumers that they go to politicians and say enough let's make deals with Russia and of course that is not gonna help Ukraine at all if that happens. Then there's the issue of price caps I don't hate to put you on the spot here but how likely is that to succeed? So, that's for oil. That's for oil day, not so much for natural gas, and the difference here is really that oil is much more fundable than natural gas. You can put oil on a ship and it's original form, liquid, and move it around relatively easily whereas, financial gas, you can't do that, put it on a ship, you need to first convert it to a liquid liquid, look right natural gas, LNG So Russia can sell oil all over the world and it can do things if if one sedination says we're not buying Russian oil. They can just sell it to other countries. So the idea among many western nations led by the United States is create this buyer's cartel that will all agree on a price cap they are willing to pay for Russian oil and I I think Catch there is you could get some nations to agree to that but you're not gonna get China to agree to that you're not gonna get India to agree to that and a bunch of others in Russia can sell that oil there so the question is would this really dent Russia's energy revenues which are been very very high this year they make an all the money they need to finance this war so that's why we're looking so much for Other way to dent Russian energy revenue Very unlikely to get help from China nor India.

Are any of the developments in Trump case? Used as leverage at all. Is there any bearing on anything from that in what you were just discussing in terms of negotiations on the continuous resolution? Well you could have a situation where there could be AA bipartisan group of lawmakers who come together in order to look into specifically the documents that were retrieved from the Marla Lago investigation by the FBI but from a broader standpoint it's just Continuation of bad headlines for former President Trump. Now, some in the Republican circles feel that those bad headlines are only gonna embolden his movement and get out the vote for far right Republican setting into the midterms but others say that it will have reverse effect for more moderate leaning voters. Speaking of getting out the vote, right? And Biden is in Ohio he's gonna be talking about the chips act but of course there is also some perhaps campaigning tinges that will be to his commentary. You know this is really interesting because it was just a couple of weeks ago and nobody wanted to be caught with President Biden and now you've got Tim Ryan who's running for senate in Ohio against JD Vance a Who will be appearing with President Biden when he goes to Ohio to talk about semiconductor chip manufacturing at an intel plant of course in tell CEO Pac Elsinger really one of the top CEOs who had pushed for this high-tech manufacturing to onshore US innovation to onshore US jobs to compete against China ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,14,2022-09-06 14:38:08

Well, there are a lot of gaps and this is a very long conversation and I I honestly, I think it belongs in our secondary education system initially because a lot of a lot of young people are coming out of high school, entering the job market, and then moving into places where they're just, they just don't have the fundamentals. I will say There are a lot of places where good things are happening. First of all, I do believe employers may especially some of the larger employers are investing heavily and training their own job force. To meet the needs as their own business of alls. And they're not only training them for those specific jobs. Many players are beginning to Opportunities for employees to get credentials or even a college degrees that will help them move into other situations. So, I believe employers are beginning to look at this hard.

I think it may very well and it's interesting that you said quantitative tightening just a second ago guess who didn't say quantitative tightening chair pal didn't mention it once last Friday which was interesting because We still had over five% euro over year waging increases that's a little bit of the stickiness of the wage price thing so you put ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,34,2022-09-06 16:04:56

Is it is it market neutralizing in terms of the move that we've been tracking since last Friday since the feds and fetch air drone pals 8 minutes speech at Jackson Hole which triggered this this most Since seller. I think it's gonna be more about quantitative tightening and I was so glad you said it because That's what has the greatest chance of moving the dial In a longer end end of the curve where the suppression of yields is being removed that's where the impetus for rising rates in the fives and the tens can come from in the near term so yes I think that employment report was kind of neutral with regards to the bond market but the doubling of the shrinking of the balance sheet that started Is far from a neutral a neutral impact Send me an hyman pro share it's global investment strategy just always good to see you have a great weekend. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,35,2022-09-06 16:09:25

I think that the pandemic through that industry through a loop and also through the hotel And and and retail industry to a loop and also through the training industry the only industry that seems to have come back from that completely without having any disruption is retail and I think that a lot of the business practices that these companies are having They need to look at their business practices and trying to figure out how do you get back on track and we need to get workers back into the workplace that's quite honestly the bottom line. The airlines, I mean, I think a lot of these flights are being cancelled or delayed.

So, the bell bag is a cheaper item that Lulu has. If you recall, if we go back, Michael Coors and bring out a lot of people into their fold. Using the watch. Which was a lower price entry point.

554,"Senior investment strategist. Great to have both of you on the program this morning. I wanna start off with you, Alison in terms of what we saw overall in this report. Again, a Kiko mentioned the softish language that Under control without losing a lot of jobs. Does the sport? Does the report this morning support that argument? Yeah, thanks for having me this morning. I think this was really a Goldilocks. Jobs report. So if you look across the different indicators, there's really something everybody in this report. So on the one hand, you know, we saw a really strong hiring again in both of the surveys that are included in this employment report. Very much suggest that the US economy is still looking quite resili Despite the the fed tightening that we've seen here today. But then on the other hand, you know, we also saw an improvement in labor supply. We saw, we saw still very strong but somewhat softer wage print this morning. So, when I think you put these two things together, Really suggest there's really something for for everybody. I'm in beneficials with different views, you know, from the more hawkish to more double side. Can probably find good news in this report Yeah Mono let's pick up on that point specifically on the wage front is Brian said you know the big concern here has been about wage growth and employers continuing to have to sort of shell out because of the type pool mark at Hey What is that print that I tell you Make too much of it. The narrative that's kind of building around inflation may have peaked. This wage growth number this morning supports that to some extent. You know the five. Two% slightly below the expectation of five. Three% on your basis. But really in line with last month's and below the peak that occurred back in ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,43,2022-09-06 16:44:15
555,"To support their view so I think the decision for the September meeting and we've heard fede officials in recent weeks you know sort of putting out there the possibility of either another 50 basis point 75 basis point hike. I think it's really gonna ultimately come down to to the upcoming CPI report. You know I think that's really what's gonna be likely to push beneficials in one direction or another. More same question. Do you think 5075, in the next meeting? Yeah, you know, look, I think we are getting an elevated Federate hike in September whether it's 50 or 75. I think to that point, the the September 13 CPI report will probably be the final determinant. You know, generally, I think we're looking at about 150 basis points, more of Fed tightening until we get to a terminal rate of 375 to four% and interestingly of course markets are now expecting a fed pause but no longer a fed pivot in 2023 and so I think you know the markets and the fed have become much more in line as of late and I think the the good thing about that is it sets us up nicely as we head into 2023 with the potential fed Eyes and a potential post midterm election market which historically has been a nice setup so near volatility probably likely as a fed continues this rate hiking cycle but that could lead to some opportunities for the year ahead.

Yes I think the impact right now is primarily isolated to in video they made GP chips that are widely used by the industry for machine learning in AI training the implications here is you know the what the US wants to limit China Ability to develop kind of military applications with it. There are some broader implications. I would say generally all pretty negative. I would say one this is only gonna push China to more regionalize their vertical semiconductors supply chain which is gonna be inefficient for the broader It's also gonna limit demand for some of the other chip makers that supply into that data center server supply chain in terms of impacting EMD I think it's actually pretty minimal for AMD they're GPO data centers roughly about one% of revenues they're not Widely as widely as adopted as in video for machine learning in AI at this point in time but the impact right now is really focused on in video ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,47,2022-09-06 17:01:23

Bill welcome to influencers. Thank you so much for joining us. Great to be here So much to get to right now.

His end game is to go move forward to expand to attack to to take territory to declare victories but he has to keep on going no matter what it is and and this is just part of that process and it and it's not like it just started now. I mean, the most recent version of this just started now. He was feeling under pressure 1008 that's when he invaded Georgia In 2014 the same thing he took Crimea And so this is this is a long process of him trying to stay in power as a dictator and the most scary part of this whole He will stop so let's just say that that he's successful in Ukraine and and that's a very big question because the Ukrainians are valuingly fighting back but let's say he was successful in Ukraine that's not the end of his story He would then go to other countries. Maybe the easy ones, maybe the hard ones, maybe it grabs mold over at some point. But his, his, the ultimate goal for him Which means Estonia or Lapiania or Poland And then to test out something that has never been tested before which is are we ready to go to war is the United States ready to go to war with Russia to protect Estonia a country of a one 1 million people that that probably you know two% of Americans could locate on a map are we ready to do that or are we not Any and he's taken the bad They were not.

562,"Sanctions program about a week ago last Tuesday I would have given the Western governments a 2 out of 10 it was all very you know two little too late then the atrocities started happen and and the sanctions started getting real when they added the major Russian banks the big oil Companies etcetera by Thursday it was an 8 out of 10 then they did swift that's a 9 out of 10 and then they did vitamin Putin and nine and a half out of 10 so there's still some some gaps that need to be filled in Swift is only done so swift means disconnecting the Russian banks from the Financial system, and they've only done 70% of the banks and so logic would tell you that if 70% of the banks are disconnected, they'll just route all the payments through the 30% of the banks that are disconnected. That's just what anyone would do and certainly the Russians will do that. So, we need to sanction the other 30% of the banks and A lot of people ask me why why are those banks protected then I can imagine that there was some you know ugly backroom deal with you know in a smokey room where somebody said we have an interest there don't do that but so those other 30% of the banks need to be sanctioned I'm disconnected from Swift and then the the most important part of the whole exercise is Vladimir Putin's own money needs to be hit Oligarchs who look after it And so we need to freeze the assets of the oligarchs in the west And a lot of announcements have been made the best that's the intention A few oligarchs about have been added to the various EU US UK sanctions lists But that needs to be done in a much more coordinated manner cuz there's different oligarchs in the US that are been sanctioned in the EU and different ones in the U then UK.

I mean, everything from Disney to Shell to the banks. Curtailing or ending their financial relationships with Russia. What do you think about that? And is this effective Well, in a certain way, I would almost argue it's more effective because okay, so the, you know, the sanctions lists are important, government activities, important, but if every western company Stops doing business with the Russians. It's it's it's really dramatic. I remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for Sergey Magnitsky. My murdered lawyer. One of the first people people I met with I was I was in South Africa and I met with Who is one of the people involved in the one of the main people involved in the antipartide movement. I'd watched him movie called Tri Freedom and and she was one of the characters in the movie and I and I met with her shortly after her game. I guess he was murdered and we talked. And we talked about how they ended apartheid and she said it was all about Disinvesting from South Africa that when they became financially isolated that's when it became too much and so I think this is really really important and I think this is probably you know as I look at the next steps what can we do next when we watch these atrocities unfold in Ukraine I think it's just to to pressure every single Western business to To stop doing business to stop supplying goods to stop supplying services to Russia.

Well, thankfully, I think that the Trump situation was an aberration. Now, I don't think it was like AA permanent damage to the relations between the United States and the rest of the world and and I don't think it it's certainly hurt the US credibility for a short period of time but we can see right now in the multilateral approach towards Russia that things continue to work as they should. I mean, it's pretty horrifying. The idea that an American president would hand over Me and a bunch of US government officials to Putin Because Putin asked for that. I mean it's just unbelievable really. And and it also seems pretty unbelievable. It took him 4 days to walk it back and it was only after the senate Planned how to vote Whether or not to hand us over and they voted 98 to oh about 20 minutes before the boat Trump through his press secretary declined Putin's offer If Trump had been reelected so that that was during the Mueller probe So if And so he was sort of Under the spotlight as far as Russia goes if he was reelected i wouldn't have been able to travel back to the United States because ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,54,2022-09-06 17:31:55
