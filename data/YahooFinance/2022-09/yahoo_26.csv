So, the UK also in a very difficult circumstance they they left Europe but they Escape some of the challenges just on the other side of the channel and high food prices, high energy prices, also hurting UK consumers. We also think UK is gonna go into recession. The new energy package that was pretty complicated and once all the details are clear and how the money is gonna flow, it will matter but it seems like maybe a bit of near term lower inflation by capping some of the prices but there's a transfer. So, more Going to households more spending means more underlying impetus for inflation. So, you know, makes the recession that we think they're going to have at the end of this year, a little bit less severe, so not nothing cataclysmic. But it also sustains that underlying spending so the bank of England's just gonna have Keep raising rates. So, it doesn't, doesn't fix things by any stretch of the imagination.

But as it turns out in this case, the parts that seem likely to slow down the most, the goods producing parts of the economy, things like that. Overweight, in the S and B, probably gonna slow down even more. And so, as a result, Mike has been pounding the table that earnings expectations probably have to come down a fair bit more than they have so far. And I think that part of normal is part of the catch up we have to get to. We have to, I think, have everyone internalize where the economy is going, what it means for earnings, and again, just to get back to the feed There's there's there's this kind of one way riskier. Things turn out better than we thought in the economy of stronger. That's just going to cause chair pal and the others to say, you know, we need to do. We need to hike more so we can slow the economy down and get it back down to that slow growth rate And so the upside is very much capped in that regard and I think that kind of normal that that alignment of where things really are going and what the central bank means when they say they're serious about bringing inflation down I don't think we're there yet.

Button put out a short statement earlier today the first thing he said was yay Gasoline prices have fallen by a dollar 30 a gallon since June but we still have more work to do and I think that's the basic tone we're gonna get from Biden and his fellow Democrats leading up to the midterm elections which are now in less than 2 months we've One inflation report left before the midterm elections we've got two federal reserve meetings the one that's coming next week and then we have one at the very beginning of November so it seems pretty clear the fed is gonna do a 75 basis point hike three quarters of percentage point next week and then what's But I'm I'm not sure what's gonna happen after that but I think what you're gonna hear Biden saying he's just gonna keep talking about gas prices because that's the that's the good story and he's gonna continue to say we have more work to do on food and other categories You know, we have seen pretty consistently over the past few months. This this inverse relationship between the president's approval rating and gasoline prices.

So, bottom line, if we end up in the green somehow today doesn't seem very likely, that would be a huge risk on bull move. I would say the same thing happens if we end this In the green we do have options expiration that is coming on Friday and that could kinda mess with some things as well as we do not have a lot of liquidity in the market finally the bond market gotta show you this 13 week tea build you that is on the very short end of the curve that is up 12 basis points to the highest I'm gonna Since 2007 have to go back to the global financial crisis and that one was when it was coming down.

So, I think it was reasonable. Oh, to assume that that was going to continue.

But actually I think the fet is pretty much open to this idea that it won't need to tighten faster if inflation remains stickier than expected. We've seen Powell admit that he is willing to change his mind if the data does not come in line with the Feds expectations. The Fed's forecast. There is no Preset path I think at this stage from a feds perspective in terms of easing up on the pace of tightening so we could very well see some further large rate heights in the coming months especially if inflation proof stickier than anticipated and you've seen in most recent communication from Fed Palsy makers that they want to The errors of the past premature monetary policy easing is not something that they want to encounter in this tightening cycle they want to avoid the the errors of the past in the 1970's or monetary policy Became unanchored and we moved into a higher inflation regime.

Yo, tech companies are most likely to engage in buybacks because they usually have so much free cash flow You know, I was talking to a couple of experts about this and the thing they said is they were like, it's not like a financial services company.

We have upcoming guidance from the Fed. Give Macro economic challenges that are showing no sign of slow So we could really start to see some abnormal buyback activity from even a midsector that frequently does buy backed.

How important is this chart to you and can you break down some of the technicals here? Yeah I think it's extremely important it's a great point and and I think when people think back they have the muscle memory of 2008 and prior crisis mean credit is at the heart of those major market drawdowns not the 25% off the top isn't a major draw down but that's more consistent Traditional bear market in order to get a bigger crisis type decline in the mid 30s and perhaps even 40 plus percent as we saw on the financial crisis typically in an un And credit would be one of those key catalysts so to create a double bond I'm here in the HYG or the JNK some of those very well followed high yield ETF is critical and I think that's Exactly what's happening. So, again, I believe the HYG is a double bottom, the J and K is a double bottom, and take it a step further whether we look in munies or preferred, you're talking about a triple bottom and things like the MUB municipal bondy TF. So, I do think it's a key cog in that bullish call but again, my call is that we are bottoming on the credit side. Noted here and I wanted to keep it with credit but specifically the sovereigns and we got the 10 year yield three.

Once you get past that, it could actually trend lower assuming that growth doesn't fall, fall off the table, you know Well, let's talk about that potential, right? Because you say in your note reacting to CPI that the terminal rate probably isn't gonna be four%. Probably zoom in before and a quarter percent. It could be four and a half percent or even higher than that. What kind of damage as the fed is trying to beat inflation with a mallet? What kind of damages that gonna do to the US economy? Well it's a difficult question to answer. You know, I mean, how much damage has been done by by high inflation over the last 18? Good point. Specifically because it hurts lower income or so much more than higher income earners, right? And there's really very little that can be done to support those folks If inflation is gonna persist at that level indefinitely. So, really in order to establish a balance in the economy, we really need to take down the man pretty significantly in order to get inflation closer to two% and that's gonna require a very restrictive Policy at this point.

Really not just labor. It's not just rising wages but there's a lot of different dynamics that I think are contributing to the increase in prices. Whether it's supply chain complications. Yes, labor issues but sometimes lack of labor. A lack of the ability to be able to work consistently in their jobs. Which is Tie to pandemic controls and also there's a real distinction to be made between inflation and price gouging and there's a lot of evidence that particularly industries with high concentrations of corporate concentrations whether it's almost all agopoly Or industries. A lot of these price increases are potentially due to just straight price gouging by a corporations. Are you concerned about inflation and higher interest rates in the impact on working people?

So we engaged PWC to do a really significant piece of benchmarking work for us around our instructor compensation earlier on this year what that Told us was that we had somewhat of an unbalance between the across the pay spectrum so we found that there were some instructors who were paying a fairly significant premium versus our competitive market And others who were not quite at market minimum. We've been very proud of the fact that for many years we have paid a premium to our instructors. We have rockstar instructors at their the best in the world.

Okay, let's ask them. What are some of those names you led me there? Well, isn't interesting? One of the things one of the learnings I have from this FedEx situation is I do think it's the recessionary But it's also the lack of credibility that now the management team's got hanging over it.

Were they gonna announce some ski to try and pull back on the energy crisis And they're gonna have a skiing whereby based it the government steps in And there's a great call that that should be a windfalled tax on the energy companies who've done It won't go not gonna see any of that Am I gonna see announcements or things like freeports as I say and and fairly right-wing stuff but the question I was asked I'd like to talk about what I call the woman on the Myland Road Omnibus And the question you and your viewers should ask is what are they gonna announce this week that will help that woman pay her bills and prevent herself from freezing all starving and I think that's really where we are.

A lot to address after this this period of morning after the funeral takes place for for the UK economy but for where the people are right now both both in tenor and just in the pulse of the country you know What is the the vibe there for lack of a better word after they come out of this period of morning especially given all these things Privatized But I think you have to look at what's happened to public services and especially what's happened to the national health There are over 100 1000 vacancies people can't get appointments with doctors and impossible to get appointed with And peep thousands of people are waiting And I think the big story is a complete collapse in its tumor confidence as human confidence predicts pretty well Coming. The consumer confidence in the UK now is below what it was in 2007 and eight. It's lower than it was ever in the history of the index starting in 1974. So that the confidence of the people the We've had three prime ministers in no time flat so I think that's a really big deal and obviously the issue particularly is gonna be is this government actually gonna be able to get any of its policies through the parliament given that Victoria MP's didn't vote for Many of them will be thinking protecting a fifth or so what's called the red wall if they go along with this does that does that mean they're gonna end up losing their seat ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,3,2022-09-19 13:56:24

It doesn't have a lot of cash flow so it's not a value stock. And the thing that's exciting I think about this ad here for our numbers are right is if if 65 1 million new customers signing up for this is right we could go back and do growth mode right if the company starts adding 10 15 20 1 million subs a year that that would sort Take the growth investors Yeah, it definitely would. If if indeed, it gets, it gets back up to those levels. For now, I was just taking a look at the stock. It's 44% from its lows back in May but it's still down 60% on the year but there have you're certainly not the only person lately who's been enthusiastic about Based on the ad supported tier we've seen a lot of analysis come out in the last week or so I know I'm way early to ask this but like is there any risk if people getting too ahead of this and two enthusiastic in advance of this offering coming out? Of course, I mean, the street could get to enthusiastic. I would just say, you know, investors are in a pretty dower mood.

I don't see inflation getting down to even close to the target tart to the fence target until sometime next year or maybe even the following. So, as rates go up, as we see growth start to slow. It feels as though and this is something that Brad brought up earlier that all of this is going to hit lower income households the hardest but do you see it also starting to bite middle income even upper middle income households as this goes on.

You know, and it really never caught on and obviously the mining Companies have been under pressure to do more share repurchases in recent years than to invest. So, but we've reached the point where we do have to replace equipment. So, I think, you know, barring a further material decline commodity prices.

So, with that in mind, I mean, when do we expect some of those incentives that start to really take hold and and be factored into the sector as a whole? Well it's interesting because if we're going to is is California has now mandated the adoption of electric vehicles or every new vehicle sold in 2035 be electric and and the sort of widespread adoption of electric vehicles that's expected we're gonna need electricity and and more electricity Aimed at improving our grid Transitioning us away from traditional sources of electricity but the reality is is that we're gonna need a tremendous amount of natural gas to support that increase electricity demand through the transition which I think both well for energy and infrastructure companies in the business of transporting story and processing and To that end I think there's also some pieces in the inflation reduction act that are relevant to traditional energy companies specifically and increase in 45 Q credits which is the price that the government is going to credit these companies to for carbon and you look at X Energy infrastructure companies who are either in the business now or exploring and investing in the opportunity to sequester to capture And the repurpose carbon dioxide that's become much more economical with the increase in the price of carbon embedded in that deal and so I think investors ultimately have sort of a binary stance on energy.

Public opinion showed very strong support for pushing back on Russia, Support material and weapons for the Ukrainian government but the US public was very reticent and does not want to engage Russia directly On the ground and what Biden indicated yesterday is that at least his administration seems like they wanna make that commitment that is something new and I think that is a bit considered a bit of an es Particularly by the Chinese government And can you talk a little bit about that escalation because I know that euros had come out with a report back in July about the probability of conflict in Taiwan Also a given speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan I mean how does this all play out when you're talking about conflict there?

So for us, this idea that it's based on their career, but also based on these objective stats Now you know as an owner that there's this value you can rely on and it and it sort of anchors how prices move. So it's it's sort of you know Josh and I were talking about this Vinny that that feels like it it's more kinda like fantasy football where you where you sort of bet on a player with the expectation that Stock will rise throughout the season. Earlier on in their career. If you look at, you know, somebody like I mean their careers are pretty established so the stock can't rise that much higher right It's a good question. Two things. I wouldn't, I would say there's similarities to to fantasy but the big difference is that we're regulated by the New Jersey division of gaming and so here it's not a competition. You don't have a fixed budget. It's not like you can win a prize On mojo just like in the real stock market you can deposit $25 thousand $5100000 ultimately and more and take the stocks that you want so it's very very different from fantasy in that way it's your second question as to you know which of the the player stocks that are gonna rise and fall the most it is true that if you pick the players early in their career Because we have something called a multiplier Multipliers a tool which basically multiplies your profits or losses ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,30,2022-09-19 15:53:30

Completely and how popular it is there and you know, here, if it seems that consumers tend to trade down when they're buying chicken instead of beef because beef is more And so then you have that sort of treat but it's a popular item there and so it also goes to show you that there are some items which are just indispensable that that no matter how much they go up a consumer will prefer. They're not willing to give it up. They're To give up some other items perhaps but another fun fact by the way and you can tell I really looked into this fried chicken stand for South Korea. South Korea number three globally behind the US and China in terms of fried chicken revenue which by the way when you think about Population.

When you see these incredibly high prices that certainly means that demand slows down but when you add to that higher interest rates which also increases borrowing costs. That's a two fold. So that you could start to see demand slowing down rather dramatically Most likely next year we already see it in housing as you just had mentioned we start to we'll start to likely see the other areas and when demand Down.

You know we start about the issue with that he said but the pandemic isn't open isn't over it's over Correct and to your point about the stats. I mean, that's really where health experts are pointing to the daily cases, the daily death toll in fact, still more than 400 so that is really piling up to to concerning commentary Experts that the pandemic may not actually be over yet even though to be fair textbooks don't necessarily When pandemics end so that's really where the debate still stands in it. It remains to be seen just how the administration handles this. Of course, de The pandemic over As a result reduce the pandemic powers and emergency declaration powers of the president and his administration so if that was a declaration yesterday That would set into motion certain action otherwise we do have to remain vigilant and see exactly what the administration does.

And I mean esperay let's take a look at how stocks are trading this morning we are seeing all major averages that are slightly in the green they had to opened in red territory but then flipped into green terry throughout the session we're looking at the The US dollar index had touched 110 earlier that's down a little bit to just above 109 but certainly we have been watching that correlation to Kiko between that dollar index and Stocks. Of course, all eyes are on the fed this week. The fed rate decision this week at 75 basis point hike is baked in but money markets haven't discounted a full 100 basis point move. That last That happened was over four decades ago under then chair Paul Volker and a lot had this been compared to Paul and Jerome Powell basically channeling his inner vocal and the hawkishness that he has really talked about woker in in previous speeches etceter Yeah and we know the fed is gonna be squarely focused on inflation J Pals may that very clear in the lead up to this meeting it and because of that we've kinda seen the market Little rattled when you think about where the CPI print came in last week. It was higher than most people were expecting and you've seen sort of the rates move up as well. Worth pointing out today. Well, you've seen some big moves in the bond markets when you look at the 10 year yield hitting it's highest level there since 2000 ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,67,2022-09-19 18:35:42
1519,"Two of the US of defensive Taiwan but I think was different about yesterday's comments was that he explicitly endorsed the idea of US troops being deployed to defend the island as opposed to kind of you know doing previous presidents have said George Bush said that we do, you know, whatever it takes to help Taiwan defend itself, and that's the, did the extent of the US commitment so far, is the US would help I want offend itself, it's With arms but Biden really went beyond that yesterday and saying that troops would be committed to the island's defense and this is beyond even what the US is willing to do in Ukraine. Public opinion showed very strong support for pushing back on Russia, Support material and weapons for the Ukrainian government but the US public was very reticent and does not want to engage Russia directly Troops on the ground and what Biden indicated yesterday is that at least his administration seems like they be willing to make that commitment that is something new and I think that is a would be considered a bit of an escal Particularly by the Chinese government And can you talk a little bit about that escalation because I know that erase had come out with a report back in July about the probability of conflict in Taiwan especially also a given Conflict there. Yeah, and to be clear, you know, we don't think there's gonna be a military conflict between US and China over Taiwan, anytime soon, but The situation is getting more tense. You've got China who's making military preparations to take over the island and may have the ability to do so within the next several years. You've got a domestic political environment inside the US that is much more hawkish towards China than it was even 5 years ago ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,68,2022-09-19 18:39:57

So, you know, it's a pretty complicated dance that's going on right now between congress and the administration. But All signs are towards deteriorate in relations and much more hawkishness of the US government. Finally, John, I know the president's gonna be traveling here to New York later Week to address the you and general assembly. Obviously, a lot of issues on the table, what's happening with Russia and Ukraine but also the broader climate discussion It's kinda the first time all the world leaders are getting together since top 26 a lot has shifted since then as a result of the concerns around energy what do you think is gonna be a central message You know, I think Biden goes to this meeting. Actually, with a lot to say. The US passed probably the most significant climate spending bill in its history and it really, you know, in the inflation reduction act. It's gonna be dedicating hundreds of Of dollars to a clean energy transition over the next 10 years primarily in the private sector through subsidies for private sector activity, tax credits, and loan guarantees and the like and I think that gives Biden a lot to talk about especially in the context where European nations are now in their short run looking at They can, you know, keep the lights on throughout the winter due to gas shortages and spiking electricity prices but in the long run, you know, the European countries still have this commitment to decarbonization but where I think the real interesting topic is gonna be this week is in the developing world ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,69,2022-09-19 18:44:16

There needs to be a deeper explanation of how they're going to react to some of these macro headwinds a bit more acute to their network than to the rest of the transportation world and then we'll actually need to see it in in principle probably not as early as the second quarter that Year but hopefully as early as the second half of their fiscal year which would cover the first half of our calendar 23 and then more importantly going forward Was the one that has been taking the biggest kid when it comes to margins more than ground how was significant Is that and when we're talking about cost cutting measures that FedEx announced how effective do you think that they'll be? Well I think it's very significant because Opportunities at the ground you know they had their first investor day in a decade in late June in Memphis which we attended and the investor focus at that time was very much on how can they get the ground margins back Couple digit levels. As you probably saw from the release last week they missed revenue by about 300 1 million dollars but the operating income was a little bit better than expected.

At some point, this has got a break. This is gotta reverse because it can't be that much easing by one central bank, the yen, so to answer the question that we began with, what is the central bank that we care about, that's gonna ease first.

All this gloom and doom are you buying it? Oh they let me thank you again for having me on but the answer to that is yes I've been projecting, you know, this decline towards a recession for some time now. So, you know, Fred Smith is a long time friend. I have tremendous respect for him. I think he finally is looking at things realistically. He mentioned the other day that between FedEx and UPS. The basically move about 12% of the US TV. Some of the biggest banks like Goldman now again looking at the reality of where we are in this downward spiral. You're talking about housing which is a key indicator from my days of Home Depot while lumber prices are coming down.

Well, it's interesting. You bring that up. It's yeah, I hate to use this. You know, but it's like a theater It's a full house and somebody else fire and everybody's rushing for the door. So, everybody's looking for that rate increase that waging increase. They wanna get it before this thing really turns down and then they lose the justification. So, whether it was in the real, whether it was in the airlines, maybe we're seeing it in a number of our factories Recently negotiated a new contract for eight to 10% increase this year and then multiple increases in years to three so Is is it high demand and they've got leverage now and they're taking full advantage of it. It's not uncommon for some of the services residential services. I know I'm seeing it myself where the rate was $100 an hour and now it's 150 with with no justification other than you know fuel prices, cost of living, etcetera. So, again, we have a never increasing level of complexity that we're having to deal with both as a consumer and as a business leader. You talked about the housing slowdown earlier.

The same piece of quad dum Hey Facebook knows they have all these solutions that aren't about content And as long as we're arguing what censorship we're not gonna hold them accountable in these other things And so the main thing that I think there's a point of common ground is you know people on the left on the right believe that people have the right to make informed choices. Right there that that you only really can consent or like If you have enough information to make that choice. And so I've been pushing for I call like nutrition labels.

I I you know, who knows where mortgage rates are gonna go this time around, but if we could find a level and stay there even if it is a higher level, that helps people figure out Monthly payment is going to be and conversely helps the builders I think generate more and more web traffic and foot traffic to start people on that home buying journey And Jay, I wanna ask about the neutral rating on Toll Brothers and the $50 12 month target that you have for them.

Will it be unemployment going higher? What is going to make the Fed cry uncle That's a perfect question and I said it's unemployment going higher I think fundamentally of course we're looking at inflation that's been the focus of everybody but that's also the past focus I think the most most important focus the economically now is gonna be the unemployment rate remember the fed has a door mandate in unfortunately they've been in a box all year because it works both both work But is the unemployment rate goes up and and as you can see in the chart in 2020 that's up on the screen and also in any prior recession it goes up very quickly and nobody's thinking right before it starts to go up okay this is gonna go up very quickly they think it'll be a nice moderate move it's not the way it works so with the Tightening with the financial conditions tightening I think the most important thing to look for in the next few months is gonna be a higher unemployment rate which will allow the Okay some direction there as we wait for that fed decision at 2 o'clock this afternoon Tony Dwyer is always good to have you on can accord genuineity chief market strategist.

We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our two% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth. And it will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to step to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. We will keep at it until we're confident the job is done.

So, we are we are very much mindful for that. And that's why I know that in my in my opening remarks that Some point as the stance of policy tightens further it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our accumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation So, that's how we think about that. Your second question, sorry was I should know better than tonight. Alright. Question. Oh, there you go. Is it linear do you keep raising major is there a pause that you could envision where you kinda figure out what what has happened to the economy and give time to catch up in the real economy the rate of which stuff to catch up with the real Me. Thank you. So so I think I think it's it's very hard to say with the precise certainty the way this is gonna unfold. As I mentioned what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that's restrictive enough To bring inflation down to two% where we have confidence of that and what you see in the SEP numbers is people's views as of as of today as of this meeting as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now, those those those will those will evolve over time And I think we'll we'll we'll just have to to see how that goes.

And a soft landing would be would be very challenging and and we don't know no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be that's gonna depend on How quickly wage in price and flesh inflation pressures come down whether expectations remain anchored and whether you know also do we get more labor supply which would help as well. In addition, the chances of a soft lending landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive. Or restrictive for longer. Nonetheless we're committed to getting inflation back down to two%. It will because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean for a greater pain later on.

Yes vacancies are still almost two to one ratio two unemployed people that's a that and quits are are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different From other cycles where which where the generally the unemployment rate itself is the is a single best indicator we think those things have for a quite a time now Really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is.

What's the incentive to continue front loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still stronger So what what we've seen is inflation has our expectation has been that We would begin to see inflation come down largely because of of supply side healing by now we would have thought to that we've who would have seen some of that we haven't we have seen some supplies side healing but inflation has not really come down if you At Core PCE inflation which is you know a good measure of where inflation is running now if you look at it on a three six and 12 month trailing annualized basis you'll see that That inflation is at 4845%, and four. Eight%. So, that's those that's a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation And that's not where we expected or wanted to be.

Well, I think the initial reaction shot is fear. Oh my god, they really went to 75 basis points. And then when you look at this written statement, you have, you have a statement that says, yes, we're gonna keep going. But then of course it bounce back well hey that's good we're gonna get inflation but under control but then pal comes out and actually says the economy is out of balance and a big part of what he's talking about is getting examples of those out of balance numbers and that's why we have inflation and we're gonna keep going until we get into balance and I think on I think the markets are saying okay we do need to Back into balance. We got somebody up there that can be trusted to do that. So, I think that's why we're edging back into the green because yeah, we know where we're going and we know we're gonna get there. Hey, Brad.

We typically see jobs growing even during a recession but the labor force grows more. So, it could be bad but it's not necessarily as bad as those numbers would seem to suggest and I think ideally given the strength that the economy and the job market, Probably where it's gonna come from not mass job losses but simply slower growth. And staying on this trajectory at Pal said that no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant the recession would be and said that's going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation precious come down when you look at things like wages do we get me indication that they're moving Rexton at the Fed wants right now We've seen real wage growth in particular go negative and that's obviously most we do to inflation but we're not seeing too much in the way of the mitigation of wages and more to the point when you combine wage growth with job growth when you look at the total growth in purchasing power we're not seeing any mitigation at all. But that's why I say if we start to seduce a wage growth pull back and with that we also see drop a drop in That can be more of an impact to the economy as a whole but no we're not there yet and frankly if we're if that hasn't even peaked yet we've still got a ways to go.

I'm gonna pull up a 2 day chart because remember that Bitcoin trades 24 hours. So, and you can see the the volatility here right around here when that announcement came out. So, went down, went up, went down. So, Very similar to what happened with other assets as well and as far as a theory is concerned also a theorium that's been on a down trend by the way over the last 10 days or so but you can see also the volatility that we saw with a theorem. Look, the bottom line is this, that these Raid hikes are having an impact on crypto assets. The Fed wants assets to come down all types of acids, housing, equities, cryptocurrency, and it is having an effect. We're definitely in a crypto winter. Cryptocurrencies Of commodities, equities, etcetera. It seems sort of naive and retrospect, doesn't it? That view, the original view that crypto could be an inflation head, right? Because of your tightening financial conditions and you're taking liquidity out of the system. It makes sense. The people would have less to go out and spend on those cryptocurrencies.

In other words, if you ask someone how much more do you expect to spend How much of their answer depends on how much more they're gonna have to they think they're going to have to spend on the same stuff Yeah I I it's a good question. It's not really one of those things that we get into a lot of specifics and asking folks what they think about the inflationary aspect of what they're spending relative to what they're actually spending but but inherent in that obviously is at least some level of inflationary pressure that it goes into it but I think really the high level just suggest that Sooner regardless of what we're seeing and debating from a marketed macro standpoint that the consumers actually feeling a little bit more Bust or or less influenced by kind of some of those those higher level And and to your point I think the gas prices is really hard to kinda overstate what the impact was on on higher prices in early June and obviously lower prices on a relative basis from there and we ask the question on just how much Fact you're seeing from gas prices on spending and it's still it's still inflated relative to historical level 60% of our respond and say that they're expecting some impact from their spending on gas prices but it's that's down 10 points from where we were in June Obviously, gas prices are down materially since since June, still up.

We were seeing a little bit of movement there but 10 out of 11 sectors in negative territory. I wanna focus in on some technology names though as you're seeing XLK down by one% as of right now. Much mirroring what we were Composite there. Not one bright spot to be found on that semiconductor stockboard here today the deepest declines being seen in AMD and in video will keep a close tab on that here as semiconductors have been in focus especially given some of Hey spending mechanisms that have been put in place by chip companies and in related to the chips act as well but even more so going forward from here much to continue to watch to see how these names really navigate ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKJ8iKKfRfs,6,2022-09-22 14:07:15

We we heard a little bit about 100 basis points heading into this meeting but it never really you know kind of took sale on the way that some of the prior 100 basis point conversations have so I think we've taken that off the table. I think also with the. Plot only A 25 days 125 basis point hike next year in the median forecast you know I think that also kind of means that we're we're fairly priced at this point so I mean if you look at kinda where front end yields are we're essentially pricing most of those hikes very accurately that the Fed has projected Unless we see again some you know continued upsize surprise in CPI another really big print or if we see fence speakers come out and and start to suggest that they need to do more seventy-fives would really be the things that would I think take those front ends higher but for Largely avoided saying anything notable you know it's a job that none of us And be having right now being in the fed chair or being on the FOMC but if there is anything that stuck out to you that was not mentioned that you're expected to hear from the fed at this point in time you know what what is that just so that we know to pay attention to that going From here.

Now, there's discussion on whether or not this actually skirts, apples, own policies, as well as users wishes because obviously if you're choosing not to be tracked, you don't want meta following you whatever browser you use. So That's really where this conversation is going and so this all comes down to that security update that Apple had made that app tracking transparency feature that they had introduced in IOS 14 and essentially with that says is apps aren't allowed to track users They do on other websites or even in other apps. If they ask the app not to track them. If they say they can be tracked, then that's fine but this has been a big problem for meta it cost them approximately 10 1 billion dollars last year and so they're looking Four ways to get around this and apparently this is seemingly one of them at least as far as the class action or proposed class action suit is concerned.

I'm I'm a big component I've always allocating across the border and all sorts of different aspect classes anywhere from five to 10% should be no more than you know significant in one portfolio obviously you don't wanna be over weighted in any asset class right or set up for that But have you know anywhere from five to 10% waiting in your portfolio I think would be more than petition So where are you seeing the inflows right now when you talk about ETF products that are market that allow investors to trade in gold One there's a couple of products that are out there that are all fine products. GLB is one of them. It's the it was the first ETF in the marketplace to actually track gold. It's about 50 1 billion assets so it's if you wanna get access to gold that I had with the physical body by the metal.

1814,"Response. Well I'll tell you what the last time they they basically said what was expected and it ended up with a surprise anyway honestly if if you gave me a Gala if you gave me the News right now I'm not sure how to trade it it's not oversold enough to say that you know everything on a negative side is discounted but clearly there's still racing rates and that's not a great news item for the economy either Tony and us here and when could argue that the Fed wants asset prices to come down all sorts of assets including the stock market as well and it has been a relatively orderly decline if you think about it right now we're looking at the S and P that's Year to date about 18% but investors want to know Markets going lower. If the fed continues on this path, 75 basis points, let's say today, then another rate hike in November and December, then, are we going to see further declines and if so by how much? Well I know so I think it's a really important point to a month ago after the summer rally when people were saying that the market is likely discounted a recession I thought that I there's no way that was true so you fast forward and you know you take for example federal express which was down about 36% from its peak in 2021 into their pre Going forward So I think it's gonna be a lot more average stock base but I also can't find a time to answer the question directly I can't find a time where the market made put unquote the low while the fed was still raising rates pretty aggressively ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKJ8iKKfRfs,42,2022-09-22 16:43:16

He wants to see them rolling down. But I think that's exactly right. So, we're not even gonna think about slowing down or even stopping much less until we get to that point. So, we have an idea of what that metric is. So, when you look at that, I think the market is expecting and in fact, this is what the. Part is saying, we're probably gonna be done maybe towards the beginning or middle of next year. I think power is saying that yeah that's our best guest but the rest is through the downside it might go on longer. Bro do you think we've had peacockishness here from the fed? I would have said so Shawna before before the press conference But when you look at The way he's talking about it. I mean, it continues to channel Basically And he keeps saying what the dad it tells us is what we're gonna do i think right now he believes this is peacockishness but he's very explicitly left the door open to keep going I think probably yes the chances of a no or a lot bigger than I would have said 20 minutes ago. Yeah, clearly willing to take some pain as he said reiterated over and over again four. Four% unemployment.

So, the deceleration housing prices that we're seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals. And you know, that's a good thing. For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better lines so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level At a reasonable pace and that people can afford houses again and I think we so we probably in the housing market have to go through a correction to get back to that place.

Four by the end of next year where do you think mortgage rates are headed I'm hearing some feel we're headed to at least But it's not a given at this point. Long term rates have actually come down a little bit after the feds announcing today we'll see if they they stay in that territory but there's usually some variability in the spread between short-term rates and mortgage rates there's a little bit more consistency between 10 year treasury rates Mortgage rates and you know as 10 year treasure rates come down that gives mortgage rates some breathing room we are not necessarily going to see another 75 point basis point surge in mortgage rates but I do think as long as inflation remains rampant as long as we don't know exactly what the endpoint will be for those short term rates that continues to put upward pressure Mortgage rates. Daniel, how long do you see this challenging environment that we're currently in right now? How long do you see this lasting?

He doesn't believe any of that. He's just trying to come up with Narrative to give the Russian people something to chew on in order for him to have a war and his war is there to stay in power and so when you say what is his endgame There is no end game. His end game is to go move forward to expand to attack to to take territory to declare victories but he has to keep on going no matter what it is. This is just part of that process and it and it's not like it just started now. I mean, the most recent version of this just started now. He was feeling under pressure in 2008.

Nobody who's got a lot of financial interest with Russia who can say anything other than this was a brazen attack on a peaceful neighbor. And that's an extremely important part of the narrative Coordinated sanctions that are that have been done right now which are causing enormous financial pain to Vladimir Putin. Yo, let's drill down into that bill sanctions. How effective are they right now and what, you know, what grade would you give them for instance and what do we need to do from here? So I'm I'm a sort of connoisseur of sanctions. It's such a thing exist and so when they first started this sanctions program about a week ago last Tuesday I would have given the Western governments a 2 out of 10. It was all very you know two little too late. Then the atrocities Started to happen and the sanctions started getting real when they added the major Russian banks the Big oil companies etcetera by Thursday it was an aid out of 10 then they did swift that's a 9 out of 10 and then they did vitamin Putin and nine and a half out of 10 so there's still some some gaps that need to be filled in Swift is only done so swift means disconnecting the Russian From the International Financial System and they've only done 70% of the banks and so logic would tell you that if 70% of the banks are disconnected they'll just route all the payments through the 30% of the banks that aren't disconnected that's just ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKJ8iKKfRfs,50,2022-09-22 17:18:05

And that will happen and and they will probably succeed in protecting some of their assets, but even if you don't get all the assets, just having a person on the sanctions list means that they're no longer that they're they're pretty much out of the game. They're benched in the world, in the international financial world. Another remarkable development or correct me if if you think I'm wrong Bill is the is the response by the private sector both in Europe and in the United States I mean everything from Disney to Shell to the banks curtailing or ending their financial relationships with Russia What do you think about that and is this effective Well, in a certain way, I would almost argue it's more effective because okay, so the, you know, the sanctions lists are important. Government activity is important. But if every western company Doing business with the Russians it's it's it's really dramatic I remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for surrogate magnitsky my murdered lawyer one of the first people people I met with I was I was in South Africa and I met with a woman named Helen Zully who is one of the people ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKJ8iKKfRfs,51,2022-09-22 17:22:20

Yeah, let's talk about some of those sticky elements. So, obviously, we're keeping a close watch on the labor market but when you think about inflation, Has started to pull back just a bit although there's still a big unknown especially with what's playing out with Russia in Ukraine. What do you think are the stickiest parts right now when it comes That you think is is gonna keep the fed at bay from cutting rates. Yeah so you haven't make a good point on energy and we do wanna know that for goods prices and core goods prices we do think those should ultimately roll we see very high inventories we've had a strong dollar people are shifting their spending from goods to services so we think that should help but on those sticky elements services Core services prices. Those are really gonna be very sticky. And you know two things come to mind for us. First shelter prices which is the biggest component is CPI. You know the way the BLS calculates that it's an average so even as market rents start to come off it takes a while to filter into the CPI rent and CPIOER so we think that's gonna start to roll maybe next year but it's gonna be you know ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKJ8iKKfRfs,69,2022-09-22 18:42:16

Not good for business is created a great dialogue. But let's see where we go from here cuz we're definitely at a crossroads. And I know you have conversations with many companies on this particular issue. What's the sentiment right now around that? I think it depends which of the letters you're talking about.

He's created the right dialogue on the right issues. As all of us in business start to think about the externalities. What else do we affect? This is not just about profit. This is The impact we have on other stakeholders. Like the planet, light society. That's got to be a good thing. You said you you don't know where it's gonna go moving forward.

That'll make a real big difference though to the EU where Still going really strong to regulate this whole area. I really expect a lot more from companies in their reporting. So one thing we do know for sure is there's gonna be a division I think between where the US is and where the EU is.

Two to $two. 7 billion to cost it's an absolutely amazing press release I get it but now they It might mean as they cut back as they ground planes as they shut sorting facilities and might mean more market share loss to an Amazon more market share laws to UPS and we could very easily be sitting here 6 months from now and it's another earnings FedEx for the next 2 years.

Yeah, it that seems like the pressure from investors were hoping and urging them that this was not a good time to raise fees despite the fact that to your point.

I'm going the wrong direction. Apparently, here we go. As we go down to the sectors, we are seeing energy stocks really under pressure here.

We saw earlier this week, YouTube announced major changes to its YouTube partner program as well. Same way to compete more with TikTok and so, Is this really going to result in people moving away from TikTok creators moving away from TikTok to go over to YouTube shorts? You know, I think that's their goal obviously. I think they're giving away what 45% of their revenue is or their ad revenue is meant to be going towards creators which is I've talked to creators who are in the creator fund for TikTok and they are not seeing numbers even close to that like for a creator to make it on their own what they're often finding is that they have to do some brand deals like they have to work From businesses if they wanna actually make a living off of TikTok. It's really not coming from the creator fund despite what people may think. So I think that seems something like YouTube shorts do this like that could be a big push. I know where on YouTube shorts for Yoga Finance. So we're already in it but I don't know if we're eligible to make any money but Me. Other things that were tracking on TikTok is not just what's going on But also there's like I mean I track Fin Twit which is like the financial world on Twitter and I know there's something like that that it also occurs on TikTok.

1898,Offering a lower price ad support solution gets him out of that corner. Great upside opportunity for the company and for the stock. It's the most identifierable catalyst I see out in consumer tech today. Walk through a thesis so that you said 20% of children users are likely to return to Netflix with this cheaper ad supported model that means 10 1 million incremental subscriber net adds one to two 1 billion dollars in incremental revenue how That churn you think or return back to Netflix comes from previous subscribers how much of it is about bringing in new subscribers on board for those who may have said before A little too much for me. Well Kiko it's almost impossible to know that and in all honesty none of us know what the real price points gonna be for Netflix we don't know how they're gonna market it Rising price sensitivity amongst Netflix customers and we've seen declining satisfaction at least on their most mature markets like the US and then when we look at what the other streaming companies are doing they're able to generate five to 10 Subscription pricing by 2 to 3 dollars and still generate more revenue per user because they can get $five plus an adreb new per So we got something that kinda addresses the price sensitivity and is positive for unit economics. I don't think that was captured in the company's valuation. I still don't think it is. And I don't think it's captured in the street estimates.
