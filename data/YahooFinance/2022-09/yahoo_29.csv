So I think that expectations that inflation you know I I hate to use the word transitory because it's been kind of you know demonized in in the last 18 months but you know we there is still this sort of long held view that inflation is not a sustainable thing that can be generated by the US economy and that really is sort of a memory of past cy And yet we had virtually known flation over the course of Of a decade. So, I think it was reasonable. Oh, to assume that that was going to continue. You know, we pump the economy full stimulus both monitoring fiscal after COVID, initially, Wasn't really that much inflation but now as the economy has you know had to sort of restart itself and there's been a lot of supply constraints specifically in in labor at this point. It's been much stickier. And and quite honestly you know that The labor market has held up very well. Wage growth is continued and there's it's it's not as much of a supply store anymore. It's really demand driven and that's much more difficult to contain once it's started to get sort of out of control There have been calls or anticipations for the unemployment rate there to tick higher even if we are to see some type of soft landing constructed but I mean the odds of that you know it depends upon who you ask at this point and Where are you expecting the employment situation to trend towards ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASlvYsGqCTg,7,2022-09-14 14:15:21

They actually show some significant signs of of reaccelerating. You know, I mean, specific to, you know, some of the elements of the CPR report that are mentioned For years on on that specific category and you know just as we see gas prices come off from the highs and June and July it looks like you're starting to see Shift is you know consumers are are immediately turning that savings around and spending it on other things and retailers are seeing that they have more pricing power than they thought in order to get that down really gonna need to see interest rate That rise very significantly and the Fed can't afford to take their foot off the accelerator at this point. But is it that they're spending on on those other things? Question with the mindset of is it that they're actually spending cash that they're saving from the gas prices coming down on other things or are they just spending on other things and it's showing up and spending but it's really kind of that credit spending and what what type of kind of scenario does that create in this broader economic equation Yeah we've seen some mixed signals on that. It recent consumer credit data has been The the biggest increases we've seen on a monthly basis Several years if not I believe one would recently was actually a record high but at the same time if we look at household balance sheets there's still a massive amount of accumulated savings amongst households from the early days of the pandemic that is is still sitting there ready to be to be spent ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASlvYsGqCTg,8,2022-09-14 14:19:41

So, as we look into In the next few weeks into earning season we're gonna be we're gonna be watching very closely what's happening with corporate profit margins for now it looks like we're still going to eat out some some earnings growth in the year end and and stay ahead of the game but there's more questions certainly ahead And given these strength of yesterday's down movement went to the downside of course what without looking to far into one day's price action just being part of the course that we've seen a number of events where the market just had to reprice a more hawkish Seemingly more than the last time, but you got it at one point wonder, when does this come down?

But I would say if there's one sector Has seen a much deeper fall off In the private equity community it's been the venture world So Can you one could argue that this is a good time to buy?

Maybe they have their inventory and warehouses. It's not costing them that much. But this is certainly a phenomenon that we're going to keep watching over the next several months because you said Household furnishings and supplies to come down more than they have Of all these things.

It could be four and a half percent or even higher than that. What kind of damage as the fed is trying to beat inflation with a mallet? What kind of damages that gonna do to the US economy? Well it's it's a difficult question to answer. You know, I mean, how much damage has been done by by high inflation over the last 18 point? It's it's really a trade off, right?

Yo, tech companies are most likely to engage in buybacks because they usually have so much free cash flow You know, I was talking to a couple of experts about this and the thing they said is they were like, it's not like a financial services company.

We have upcoming guidance from the Fed. Give Macro economic challenges that are showing no sign of slow So we could really start to see some abnormal buyback activity from even a midsector that frequently does buy backed.

So, it did take a little bit of a dip when we announce the fee, change, which which Surprising and it's mount back to where it was before and that's because one our business models entirely aligned with our sellers. We only succeed when they succeed. And a six and a half percent commission is actually great value compared with what it would cost to market themselves in any other platform.

How important is this chart to you and can you break down some of the technicals here? Yeah I think it's extremely important it's a great point and and I think when people think back they have the muscle memory of 2008 and prior crisis mean credit is at the heart of those major market drawdowns not the 25% off the top isn't a major draw down but that's more consistent Traditional bear market in order to get a bigger crisis type decline in the mid 30s and perhaps even 40 plus percent as we saw on the financial crisis typically in an un And credit would be one of those key catalysts so to create a double bond I'm here in the HYG or the JNK some of those very well followed high yield ETF is critical and I think that's Exactly what's happening. So, again, I believe the HYG is a double bottom, the J and K is a double bottom, and take it a step further whether we look in munies or preferred, you're talking about a triple bottom and things like the MUB municipal bondy TF.

And there's really very little that can be done to support those folks If inflation is gonna persist at that level indefinitely.

Really not just labor. It's not just rising wages but there's a lot of different dynamics that I think are contributing to the increase in prices. Whether it's supply chain complications. Yes, labor issues but sometimes lack of labor. A lack of the ability to be able to work consistently in their jobs. Which is Tie to pandemic controls and also there's a real distinction to be made between inflation and price gouging and there's a lot of evidence that particularly industries with high concentrations of corporate concentrations whether it's almost all agopoly Or industries.

So, one of the things that he that that probably wanted to address was, hey, we already put people gotta have fixed pricing. Gotta go to order the vehicle and that's what you pay for. That's what tells the works, right? So, with the dealer structure as it is, dealers can set pricing but they'd, but Ford is on them, whatever price you put online, that is the final price you cannot change that Bars can crash up across deals for cheaper cars but once that price on the website that's it you cannot add any kind of mark ups and things like that. So, they wanna make that process, yes, yeah. So, between that and these fees that they're asking the dealers to pay, are are they gonna get push From the dealers. I mean, the dealer network is really important still to Yeah I mean I bet you'll see a certain percentage of them so you know what we don't want them we'll just stick with the traditional cars that the F one 50s the Mustangs of as we just saw and sell gas part and then you can revisit that later you can actually you know what 5 years time you can say Ford can we revisit this certification and they can Open that up apparently.

Were they gonna announce some ski to try and pull back on the energy crisis And they're gonna have a skiing whereby based it the government steps in And there's a great call that that should be a windfalled tax on the energy companies who've done It won't go not gonna see any of that Am I gonna see announcements or things like freeports as I say and and fairly right-wing stuff but the question I was asked I'd like to talk about what I call the woman on the Myland Road Omnibus And the question you and your viewers should ask is what are they gonna announce this week that will help that woman pay her bills and prevent herself from freezing all starving and I think that's really where we are.

The consumer confidence in the UK now is below what it was in 2007 and eight. It's lower than it was ever in the history of the index starting in 1974. So that the confidence of the people the We've had three prime ministers in no time flat so I think that's a really big deal and obviously the issue particularly is gonna be is this government actually gonna be able to get any of its policies through the parliament given that Victoria MP's didn't vote for Many of them will be thinking protecting a fifth or so what's called the red wall if they go along with this does that does that mean they're gonna end up losing their seat ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,3,2022-09-19 13:56:24

It doesn't have a lot of cash flow so it's not a value stock. And the thing that's exciting I think about this ad here for our numbers are right is if if 65 1 million new customers signing up for this is right we could go back and do growth mode right if the company starts adding 10 15 20 1 million subs a year that that would sort Take the growth investors Yeah, it definitely would. If if indeed, it gets, it gets back up to those levels. For now, I was just taking a look at the stock.

I don't see inflation getting down to even close to the target tart to the fence target until sometime next year or maybe even the following. So, as rates go up, as we see growth start to slow.

You know, and it really never caught on and obviously the mining Companies have been under pressure to do more share repurchases in recent years than to invest.

Public opinion showed very strong support for pushing back on Russia, Support material and weapons for the Ukrainian government but the US public was very reticent and does not want to engage Russia directly On the ground and what Biden indicated yesterday is that at least his administration seems like they wanna make that commitment that is something new and I think that is a bit considered a bit of an es Particularly by the Chinese government And can you talk a little bit about that escalation because I know that euros had come out with a report back in July about the probability of conflict in Taiwan Also a given speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan I mean how does this all play out when you're talking about conflict there?

A lot has shifted since then as a result of the concerns around energy. What do you think is gonna be a central message? You know, I think Biden goes to this meeting actually with a lot to say.

It's gonna be dedicating hundreds Millions of dollars to a clean energy transition over the next 10 years primarily in the private sector through subsidies for private sector activity, tax credits, and loan guarantees in the like and I think that gives Biden a lot to talk about especially in the context where European nations are now in their short Looking at ways they can, you know, keep the lights on throughout the winter due to gas shortages and spiking electricity prices but in the long run, you know, the European countries still have this commitment to decarbonization but where I think the real interesting topic is gonna be this week is in the developing world Finance these kind of commitments I think you're gonna see the UN and the developing world really hammer a lot on the developed world to try to contribute Help with their both climate transition and also climate resiliency and I think that's gonna be one of the big themes of the UN this week.

When you see these incredibly high prices that certainly means that demand slows down but when you add to that higher interest rates which also increases borrowing costs. That's a two fold. So that you could start to see demand slowing down rather dramatically Most likely next year we already see it in housing as you just had mentioned we start to we'll start to likely see the other areas and when demand Down.

Public opinion showed very strong support for pushing back on Russia, Support material and weapons for the Ukrainian government but the US public was very reticent and does not want to engage Russia directly Troops on the ground and what Biden indicated yesterday is that at least his administration seems like they be willing to make that commitment that is something new and I think that is a would be considered a bit of an escal Particularly by the Chinese government And can you talk a little bit about that escalation because I know that erase had come out with a report back in July about the probability of conflict in Taiwan especially also a given Conflict there. Yeah, and to be clear, you know, we don't think there's gonna be a military conflict between US and China over Taiwan, anytime soon, but The situation is getting more tense. You've got China who's making military preparations to take over the island and may have the ability to do so within the next several years.

It's gonna be dedicating hundreds of Of dollars to a clean energy transition over the next 10 years primarily in the private sector through subsidies for private sector activity, tax credits, and loan guarantees and the like and I think that gives Biden a lot to talk about especially in the context where European nations are now in their short run looking at They can, you know, keep the lights on throughout the winter due to gas shortages and spiking electricity prices but in the long run, you know, the European countries still have this commitment to decarbonization but where I think the real interesting topic is gonna be this week is in the developing world ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,69,2022-09-19 18:44:16

Obviously there were there was a quite a bit of discuss Online about whether or not since the president wasn't the one who called the pandemic whether he should be the one to sort of take that off the table given that they are still deaths in hospitalization so bit of control they see there but obviously COVID not gone yet he did state there's still a risk but saying the pandemic is over that's that's a strong move that not everybody is on board with yeah just take a look at this toxic Becomes more of a global play just from our revenue perspective in terms of getting the shots out there and making the vaccine available for other countries compared to maybe the slower growth obviously that we would see here in the US but again shares off seven% it wouldn't be surprised maybe if this drop continues down for a couple of days alright coming up next with FedEx flashing a warning sign about the Bob Nardelli doing this next ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxz0lF2NkbM,83,2022-09-19 19:45:22

So, everybody's looking for that rate increase that waging increase. They wanna get it before this thing really turns down and then they lose the justification. So, whether it was in the real, whether it was in the airlines, maybe we're seeing it in a number of our factories Recently negotiated a new contract for eight to 10% increase this year and then multiple increases in years to three so Is is it high demand and they've got leverage now and they're taking full advantage of it.

I know I'm seeing it myself where the rate was $100 an hour and now it's 150 with with no justification other than you know fuel prices, cost of living, etcetera.

You know, I think in an era like this We're inflation is running and it levels that we haven't seen in 40 years, right? I think much more of it is about how low the price point goes and much less of it is actually about the the type of attic experience that the consumer gets. You know, I would suspect that you know, Netflix has a history of sort of testing and learning, and going slow, and so I think whatever you see in terms of the attic experience early on is probably not indicative of the terminal urine answer. You know, we've seen this with YouTube as an example, right? Where the the types of ads, the quantity of ads, the number of ads, all those things have sort of changed quite a lot.

Well, I think I think it's a great question. I mean, obviously, it depends on the source of that of that inflation and it's essentially been driven by two shocks. The COVID shock and a war in you crank. How many interesting if you go to the bank of England's Forecast. So the question you always think about what is inflation gonna look like 2 years out.

I came forward because I saw that the information that Facebook Holding from the public was critical to the public public safety that people needed to know in order to make responsible choices And that Facebook was consistently resolving trade offs in a way that was in their own interests and not in the interest of public safety They're putting profits over people ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmKj2Mc7hTs,46,2022-09-20 17:05:06

They involve product choices. Like should you have a multi picker that lets you spam out to 10 groups at the same time. The same piece of quad dum Hey Facebook knows they have all these solutions that aren't about content And as long as we're arguing what censorship we're not gonna hold them accountable in these other things And so the main thing that I think there's a point of common ground is you know people on the left on the right believe that people have the right to make informed choices.

It sounds like you think that that makes sense. I think that the federal reserves responsibility is risk management No economist generally think that what really matters for the economy is the interest rate relative to the level of inflation So that means if inflation's running at four and a half percent five% And our workers and their families and small companies are expecting a place to continue at five% Even a three% or a four% interest rate is not actually that tight.

Okay, that's what they think. Maybe the most likely one About it.

Four% is the average of where it was in in previous cycles that actually you know that isn't a significant wise. That would be considered as a healthier economy.

The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to four. Four% at the end of next year a half percentage going higher than in the June projections. Over the next 3 years the median unemployment rate runs above the meeting estimate of its longer run normal level. Inflation remains well above our two% longer run goal.

Nine% by the end of 2025 still above the median estimate of it's longer run value Of course these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our two% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth. And it will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to step to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. We will keep at it until we're confident the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country Everything we do is in service to our public mission We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.

As I mentioned what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that's restrictive enough To bring inflation down to two% where we have confidence of that and what you see in the SEP numbers is people's views as of as of today as of this meeting as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now, those those those will those will evolve over time And I think we'll we'll we'll just have to to see how that goes. I I there is a possibility certainly that we would go to go to a certain level that we were confident in and and stay there for a time.

And a soft landing would be would be very challenging and and we don't know no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be that's gonna depend on How quickly wage in price and flesh inflation pressures come down whether expectations remain anchored and whether you know also do we get more labor supply which would help as well. In addition, the chances of a soft lending landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive. Or restrictive for longer. Nonetheless we're committed to getting inflation back down to two%. It will because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean for a greater pain later on. Do you still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there? Yes vacancies are still almost two to one ratio two unemployed people that's a that and quits are are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different From other cycles where which where the generally the unemployment rate itself is the is a single best indicator we think those things have for a quite a time now Really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is.

We didn't vote on that. I would say that, you know, we're committed to getting to a restrictive level Of For the federal funds rate and getting their pretty quickly And that's what we're thinking about Some discussion now Of overdoing it. What's the incentive to continue front loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still stronger So what what we've seen is inflation has our expectation has been that We would begin to see inflation come down largely because of of supply side healing by now we would have thought to that we've who would have seen some of that we haven't we have seen some supplies side healing but inflation has not really come down if you At Core PCE inflation which is you know a good measure of where inflation is running now if you look at it on a three six and 12 month trailing annualized basis you'll see that That inflation is at 4845%, and four. Eight%. So, that's those that's a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation And that's not where we expected or wanted to be. So, what that tells us is that we we need to continue and we can keep doing these and we did today do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to and we're still discovering what that level is but people are writing that down In the recipe where they think policy needs to be so that that's how that's how we're thinking about it Let's go to Colby.

And then when you look at this written statement, you have, you have a statement that says, yes, we're gonna keep going. But then of course it bounce back well hey that's good we're gonna get inflation but under control but then pal comes out and actually says the economy is out of balance and a big part of what he's talking about is getting examples of those out of balance numbers and that's why we have inflation and we're gonna keep going until we get into balance and I think on I think the markets are saying okay we do need to Back into balance.

We typically see jobs growing even during a recession but the labor force grows more. So, it could be bad but it's not necessarily as bad as those numbers would seem to suggest and I think ideally given the strength that the economy and the job market, Probably where it's gonna come from not mass job losses but simply slower growth. And staying on this trajectory at Pal said that no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant the recession would be and said that's going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation precious come down when you look at things like wages do we get me indication that they're moving Rexton at the Fed wants right now We've seen real wage growth in particular go negative and that's obviously most we do to inflation but we're not seeing too much in the way of the mitigation of wages and more to the point when you combine wage growth with job growth when you look at the total growth in purchasing power we're not seeing any mitigation at all.

Long term rates have actually come down a little bit after the feds announcing today we'll see if they they stay in that territory but there's usually some variability in the spread between short-term rates and mortgage rates there's a little bit more consistency between 10 year treasury rates Mortgage rates and you know as 10 year treasure rates come down that gives mortgage rates some breathing room we are not necessarily going to see another 75 point basis point surge in mortgage rates but I do think as long as inflation remains rampant as long as we don't know exactly what the endpoint will be for those short term rates that continues to put upward pressure Mortgage rates. Daniel, how long do you see this challenging environment that we're currently in right now? How long do you see this lasting?

We saw earlier this week, YouTube announced major changes to its YouTube partner program as well. Same way to compete more with TikTok and so, Is this really going to result in people moving away from TikTok creators moving away from TikTok to go over to YouTube shorts? You know, I think that's their goal obviously. I think they're giving away what 45% of their revenue is or their ad revenue is meant to be going towards creators which is I've talked to creators who are in the creator fund for TikTok and they are not seeing numbers even close to that like for a creator to make it on their own what they're often finding is that they have to do some brand deals like they have to work From businesses if they wanna actually make a living off of TikTok. It's really not coming from the creator fund despite what people may think. So I think that seems something like YouTube shorts do this like that could be a big push.

Walk through a thesis so that you said 20% of children users are likely to return to Netflix with this cheaper ad supported model that means 10 1 million incremental subscriber net adds one to two 1 billion dollars in incremental revenue how That churn you think or return back to Netflix comes from previous subscribers how much of it is about bringing in new subscribers on board for those who may have said before A little too much for me. Well Kiko it's almost impossible to know that and in all honesty none of us know what the real price points gonna be for Netflix we don't know how they're gonna market it Rising price sensitivity amongst Netflix customers and we've seen declining satisfaction at least on their most mature markets like the US and then when we look at what the other streaming companies are doing they're able to generate five to 10 Subscription pricing by 2 to 3 dollars and still generate more revenue per user because they can get $five plus an adreb new per So we got something that kinda addresses the price sensitivity and is positive for unit economics.

In fact, gasoline benefited to a degree from those high prices for diesel and jet fuel When refinery process is crude oil it cannot just say lake make one product they might wanna make more diesel more jet fuel but they have to make more gasoline and kerosene and home heating oil at the same time they cannot pars out those individual products so gasoline price Benefited from that. I was why we saw those decreases since mid June. Going forward, it's really going to depend on refinery capacity which is not able to keep up with demand for the most part. Well, barely able to keep up with demand And that we are seeing problems in some gas stations not being able to have all their pumps and operation because they cannot get all the gasoline that they need and it's still a shortage of truck drivers that affects things.

Well now let's take a closer look at the border market with Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist Jeffrey Kleintop so Jeffrey as you're taking a look at what markets are reacting to right now and you're really saying the currency story is the one to keep an eye on what are the currency markets telling you right now I think that's true. You know, stocks have completed this round trip voyage and and and at their new all-time lows for the year. They rose over the summer but then have come all the way back and European stocks, you know, Andrea into a pair of market as equities rallied from mid June to mid August this year. The currency market was skeptical. The dollar Can you do rise as a safe haven trade continued in the market it's difficult for me to imagine a durable rebound in global equities without the dollar at least stabilizing clearly there's no signs of that today Jeffrey taking a look at the declines once again today coming off what was a brutal week for the market's last week at the levels that we're looking at today do you think we're near the bottom? Well, that's hard to say. I think I think one of the concerns is are we going to get a mild recession or a deep one? I think a mild recession is probably more than priced in at this point. The question is, how much deeper is that going to go? Of course, that's very dependent upon central banks. Do they continue to push higher and higher wanting to be the poll volcars of their era until they get Policy rates into real Territory right now.

I think investors wanna focus on quality stocks across sectors not just trying to pick out a sector too that might be out performing one of the ways we've defined quality this year or what we call short duration stocks. Companies that get more of their cash flows in the near term than out over the next several years. So, that's a lower price to cash flow ratio. Those Even in the month of September. So, focusing on that is important. Second, I think high dividend payers. A very similar theme companies paying a high dividend generally a good cash flow and strong balance sheets. Those stocks have been doing very well this year. Not avoided losses but really I've only experienced about half the losses of the overall market. So, it's another theme investors wanna keep in mind. High dividend payers In every sector are outperforming you don't just have to go to those classic high dividend pairs and say utilities or or telecom you can find them even in the text sector the highest dividend pairs are the outperformers Jeffrey, do you have some cash on the sidelines right now like some of our viewers likely do? Are you putting money to work or should investors wait maybe for some of this volatility to calm down? Well I think it I I think you can use volatility as your friend if you if you've got a long time horizon you've got some cash I think dollar cost averaging into this type of a volatile market does make long term sense are they trying to pick a bottom is very hard you know increasingly we're seeing more value even in the bond market despite the sell out there with high yield bonds now yielding over nine% We've got you know divide to the US are now higher than they've been in quite some time.

We're all central banks are tightening in a synchronized manner but in an uncoordinated matter. And this combine tightening of monetary policy around the world We'll have consequences that I'm not sure everyone is capturing at this point. And so when you look at obviously what the feathers looking at is is backwards looking when you look at some of the CPI data and there was concern that perhaps you should sort of wait and sort of see how these things are impacting the real economy before continuing to be so aggressive what's your take on that I think all Central Banks and all policy makers right now are convinced that they need to regain control over inflation. They were all a bit late to the game in terms of tightening monetary policy in the face of what has become persistently elevated inflation and they want to regain control over the inflation and the inflation narrative. And in doing so, they will want to tighten monetary Aggressively continue doing so even if that entails some pain in the form of higher unemployment rate and has power set it below potential trend growth that means essentially that the fed another central banks are looking for a significant cooling of demand a significant tightening of financial conditions and they won't back down at Signs of an economic slowdown. If anything, that slowdown is what they want to see to hope for lower inflation.

And and sticking with the consumer in terms of where we are with supply and demand. Are we seeing any sort of leveling off at this point? Any sort of parity coming in now? We are in some sectors.

Think about 2008 when Lehman brothers went down Policy shifted to ESA. And that is one of my scenarios as a possibility for the future Scenario would be that the very strong dollar Because the strong dollar reads to typically leads to financing issues and if that happens and if you have a coordinated Of supporting the dollar like we did with the plaza accord in 1985 that will be a turn around in policy as well so you need accidents to change it your knock it's not going to happen With the normal course of time Finally Shri while we're talking about the fed right now obviously we're in a global higher rate environment a lot of focus being placed on the bank of England given what has played out over the last few days the huge swing that we've seen in the pound also on the back of these tax cuts that have been propos By this new administration.

No i don't think so at all all of those companies profit on higher commodity prices utilities really only have their fortunes based on solid regulation and the investments that they have in their company so if the price of natural gas goes It really is a pass through from from the utility to the customer.

I mean, it doesn't make sense for them to leave and sort of to turn the page here and then, What's next I mean, it wouldn't be a surprise if after 2 years, you start to see some turnover in the cabinet. That's a normal thing. You know, as they say for the advisers to the president, it's a sprint and for the president It's a marathon. So, They've had a remarkably low amount of turnover in the first 2 years. So, Part is is natural. I guess the only thing that i would say about fiscal Message to monetary policy It probably won't be. You know, if you, if you look at the historic Pattern of of legislative activity Almost everything they're gonna do legislatively on the fiscal side and then as you go through the administration they rely more on executive orders and regulatory actions and things like that but at a much smaller scale than what they do in the first 100 days or the 1 year when they when they kind of enacting their mandate.

The way we interpret that is really that for most investors, this is a good time to be underweight stocks which is what we're doing in the global location fund. Why is that? I think there are couple reasons. You know, the first of which we've been living with all year. Given multi-decade highs and inflation were seen Most aggressive tighten campaign from the feded other central banks and decades that is causing valuations and multiple scroll down I think most of that process is down but it doesn't mean you can't go a bit further But going forward arguably the larger risk for equities is not so much the multiple it's earnings and we're still in an environment where endless have been very Keeping optimistic earnings assumptions is the economy slows as recession risk does go up the odds that you can be able to deliver on those earnings go down or I think one of the challenges one of the key things from vest is going forward is to look for companies that are gonna be able to demonstrate earnings resiliency In a much much tougher macro environment. Do you believe that software is gonna be able to do that? Software has been extremely hit hard. It yet it's kind of leak or kind of linked in with your stable growth equities play right now. Industry such a software and and health care Services. That is correct do we do think that these areas are gonna be more resilient and are exactly right Saw for companies tech companies obviously very aggressively valued early in the year late last year and as real rates have had this massive adjustment ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMzGq1hnpU,9,2022-09-28 14:23:32

Now, for investors out there, frame that for us, what is that look like? What does it look like for GDP? People losing their jobs like, what is coming at investors that they can't probably see right now? So I think there are couple things I I think the truth is most investors do see them which is why we're at where we're at you know look That only has one instrument that they can use right now and that is to hammer demand. You you can't fix the supply issues from the perspective of a monitoring policy. So, lower demand means you are probably going to see.

See you highlighted a key component of our growth story. This is an organic growth story that's complimented with the consolidation or the roll up of a very fragmented competitor base inside of our industry. Acquisitions to historically been a good part of that.

It is a bandage but it's a band aid on a gaping 1 day that's that's the problem that I'm seeing here because if you're looking at it again when inflation is a problem and the Bank of Central Bank of your country is trying to contain inflation air pressure yet the government is coming in ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMzGq1hnpU,74,2022-09-28 19:07:30

It is at this point that probably your taxes increased dramatically. Can they do something? Yes, they can they can go go back. They can reverse this policy and they can focus on the long-term issues as I mentioned while with the government playing ball with the Bank of England because bankruptcy made a very interesting statement today When I read that I said okay they're actual targeting the government here. They said the decision might the government to do this tax policy. The tax announcement has caused the UK stock market to decline significantly and create it a material risk.

I'm certainly this to me reminds me of Mario Draggy's words about a decade ago when he said, no, by many, any means We're gonna be supporting the Euro on paraphrasing. And and that's what we heard today, you know, at any scale necessary, we're we're gonna be buying. So, that to me is is a big, signal that there, there's going to be support there. Does this change the inevitable future that's ahead in the UK economically I don't know the answer to that. It remains to be written. But certainly, at least for the time being, this is, this is a good sign, and you know, who knows what the future holds in terms of amending this mini budget, all kinds of things could happen But at least for now the free fall that that was occurring has has been stopped.
