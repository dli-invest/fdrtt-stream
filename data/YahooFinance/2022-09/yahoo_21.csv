I do think that over the winter commodities are gonna be a huge wildcard. You know, we've seen that July In the S and P 500. And I think that's been proven out because policy is still uncertain. The economy is still uncertain. And commodities really amplify that. We've had this decline for now but given the really low growth trajectory, Active oil is still where it is. Below where it was, right? But i think without Russia and Ukraine conflict, oil would be more like $70 a bar and not where it is today.

16,Say we have argue that US economy can achieve a soft landing even though the path is narrow what's your view just on the fed being able to navigate a soft landing at this Yeah I think the odds are probably one and three chances at this point and that's instinct with what Goldman has been saying given the ISM service data being stronger than expected but jobs numbers from last week also better than expected Is a buffer for the fed to continue to raise interest rates without Yeah knocking the economy back into recession so I think at this point the odds about one to three is is reasonable certainly as we get more data points that number certainly move quite a bit And Amy as you talk about the about that buffer there. How does the housing and rental sector play into that? It's a great question. I think as the affordability index for the real estate market continues to decline lower given that mortgage rates have shot higher quite a bit. I think the rental market is something where going to watch quite quite closely. You're you're seeing that on a month over month Increasing maybe half per percentage point but that may continue to be AA factor of YCPI numbers can stay elevated because again those leases are going to start to roll over into higher numbers as the as the real estate market continues to become less and less of affordable. Much more on the rental market across the country later in the show. What can be the next catalyst to move these markets back in the other direction?

Earnings here for the third quarter and then of course looking out to 2023 Morgan Sandley's Mike Wilson he was out with a note saying that in 2023 he expects profits to fall three% even in the absence of an economic recession I guess how Of a of a drop do you think we could potentially say You know, at this point, given the future earning season, the market is still expecting eight% growth rate for SMP 500 earnings. I think that is likely to move lower as we head into the Q, three earning season of course into the Year when companies can can report food here as well as 2023 guidance and so I think at this. Eight% broke is still pretty high I would expect something maybe low single digits to be probably the base case from what we're seeing given some of the management commentaries we've heard Alright, Amy calling always great to have you.

Of course, California's been moving very quickly in the direction of of clean energy which makes it so that when solar production begins to taper off in the in the evening hours, you begin to see tighter supplies. It's also been retiring more conventional power plants. In recent years. Now, of course, Climate change heat waves like this are becoming more severe and that you know creates AA challenge of managing demand. So there's a lot going on.

So as we look at some of the work that needs to be done what do we know about sort of the funding behind some of these projects really find reinforce the grid and really improve California's chances going forward Right? California have big capital spending plans if they're trying to push forward to help do two things to prepare the grid for this greater electricity demand. Not only with electric vehicles but also efforts to electric fire homes, phase out natural gas, Trying to you know make large investments and And do spending that will reduce wildfire risks.

The reality is you have a lot of technical teams of a lot of running a lot of tests. They've done a lot of what are called test snaps and so it's probably going to be fine but it's gonna change fundamentally how the network works and that's gonna have a big impact Ecosystem and it's uncertain how that's gonna go but it could be really good if it all goes well. That's a big gift cuz this is it's going to be happening live so a lot of people wondering that proof of steak, proof of work, the differences there. I know that it's gonna make a big difference when it To minus what are some of the other key differences that come with the match So, there's a few probably, I guess we could break it down into three areas. So, the first is just from the standpoint of environmental. I mean, we've had a big concern kind of from the whole ESG community Around issues of kind of the energy consumption involved in mining and so that's gonna go away the energy consumption will drop by orders of magnitude so that's you know positive Are a lot of security changes that this is bringing about with it and if you understand the way that blockchain networks work the key thing that they're doing is keeping your data secure. Right? There are security trade offs that come with this in one hand it is certainly more secure from certain types of attacks and certain type of attack of actors so that's a positive thing but there are as I said trade offs there's other types of attacks that are Potentially a bigger vulnerabilities and because of the fact that this hasn't been tested at this scale before there's uncertainty about how those things will play at so it's the second thing the third thing that's really important is the insurance rate of the underlying ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,91,2022-09-06 20:13:53
32,"For somebody who doesn't have it already I tend to be quite bullish on the changes that we'll see over time. The example I always give people is look at viruses in kind of the windows 2000 windows XP days. They were terrible, right? For a lot of years you Just one piece of malware after another That was a problem that we're able to solve with technology because it turns out that the vulnerabilities become somewhat predictable, somewhat repetitive, and you learn to develop best practice Where we can datamind all kinds of things and build Algorithms that are gonna allow us to self drive etcetera. So, when you can take that kind of automation, not a time of technology, it's one of the things we're doing it. Defy yield, my company, Basically Build almost a smart contract antiviruses then you're gonna be in a position where I think you can clean up a lot of that so we're in the early days and the fact that we have seen so many acts and so many scams and so much Is a sign of that but I think that given time we're going to address these things and so probably 10 years from now just like nowadays what was the last big virus or piece of malware that you heard about on windows or OSX You don't hear about them. It's probably the same as gonna be true in crypto at web 310 years from now. We know that a lot of retail investors really looking for sort of some of these high yield returns but we saw sort of the downfall of that things like voyager, some of these other Act like CD accounts.

34,"For Ukraine so that consumers in the West basically say I can't take it anymore I can't take this high energy prices we've got to make some deal with Russia even it if it requires selling out Ukraine that's what Putin wants and we need to be on alert to that here in the West because he exactly that is exactly what Putin is trying to do is cause so much pain Among consumers that they go to politicians and say enough let's make deals with Russia and of course that is not gonna help Ukraine at all if that happens. Then there's the issue of price caps I don't hate to put you on the spot here but how likely is that to succeed? So, that's for oil. That's for oil day, not so much for natural gas, and the difference here is really that oil is much more fundable than natural gas. You can put oil on a ship and it's original form, liquid, and move it around relatively easily whereas, financial gas, you can't do that, put it on a ship, you need to first convert it to a liquid liquid, look right natural gas, LNG So Russia can sell oil all over the world and it can do things if if one sedination says we're not buying Russian oil. They can just sell it to other countries. So the idea among many western nations led by the United States is create this buyer's cartel that will all agree on a price cap they are willing to pay for Russian oil and I I think Catch there is you could get some nations to agree to that but you're not gonna get China to agree to that you're not gonna get India to agree to that and a bunch of others in Russia can sell that oil there so the question is would this really dent Russia's energy revenues which are been very very high this year they make an all the money they need to finance this war so that's why we're looking so much for Other way to dent Russian energy revenue Very unlikely to get help from China nor India.

Are any of the developments in Trump case? Used as leverage at all. Is there any bearing on anything from that in what you were just discussing in terms of negotiations on the continuous resolution? Well you could have a situation where there could be AA bipartisan group of lawmakers who come together in order to look into specifically the documents that were retrieved from the Marla Lago investigation by the FBI but from a broader standpoint it's just Continuation of bad headlines for former President Trump. Now, some in the Republican circles feel that those bad headlines are only gonna embolden his movement and get out the vote for far right Republican setting into the midterms but others say that it will have reverse effect for more moderate leaning voters. Speaking of getting out the vote, right? And Biden is in Ohio he's gonna be talking about the chips act but of course there is also some perhaps campaigning tinges that will be to his commentary. You know this is really interesting because it was just a couple of weeks ago and nobody wanted to be caught with President Biden and now you've got Tim Ryan who's running for senate in Ohio against JD Vance a Who will be appearing with President Biden when he goes to Ohio to talk about semiconductor chip manufacturing at an intel plant of course in tell CEO Pac Elsinger really one of the top CEOs who had pushed for this high-tech manufacturing to onshore US innovation to onshore US jobs to compete against China ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,14,2022-09-06 14:38:08

Well, there are a lot of gaps and this is a very long conversation and I I honestly, I think it belongs in our secondary education system initially because a lot of a lot of young people are coming out of high school, entering the job market, and then moving into places where they're just, they just don't have the fundamentals. I will say There are a lot of places where good things are happening. First of all, I do believe employers may especially some of the larger employers are investing heavily and training their own job force. To meet the needs as their own business of alls. And they're not only training them for those specific jobs. Many players are beginning to Opportunities for employees to get credentials or even a college degrees that will help them move into other situations. So, I believe employers are beginning to look at this hard.

I think it may very well and it's interesting that you said quantitative tightening just a second ago guess who didn't say quantitative tightening chair pal didn't mention it once last Friday which was interesting because We still had over five% euro over year waging increases that's a little bit of the stickiness of the wage price thing so you put ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,34,2022-09-06 16:04:56

Is it is it market neutralizing in terms of the move that we've been tracking since last Friday since the feds and fetch air drone pals 8 minutes speech at Jackson Hole which triggered this this most Since seller. I think it's gonna be more about quantitative tightening and I was so glad you said it because That's what has the greatest chance of moving the dial In a longer end end of the curve where the suppression of yields is being removed that's where the impetus for rising rates in the fives and the tens can come from in the near term so yes I think that employment report was kind of neutral with regards to the bond market but the doubling of the shrinking of the balance sheet that started Is far from a neutral a neutral impact Send me an hyman pro share it's global investment strategy just always good to see you have a great weekend. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,35,2022-09-06 16:09:25

So, the bell bag is a cheaper item that Lulu has. If you recall, if we go back, Michael Coors and bring out a lot of people into their fold. Using the watch. Which was a lower price entry point.

Again, a Kiko mentioned the softish language that Under control without losing a lot of jobs. Does the sport? Does the report this morning support that argument? Yeah, thanks for having me this morning. I think this was really a Goldilocks. Jobs report. So if you look across the different indicators, there's really something everybody in this report. So on the one hand, you know, we saw a really strong hiring again in both of the surveys that are included in this employment report. Very much suggest that the US economy is still looking quite resili Despite the the fed tightening that we've seen here today. But then on the other hand, you know, we also saw an improvement in labor supply. We saw, we saw still very strong but somewhat softer wage print this morning. So, when I think you put these two things together, Really suggest there's really something for for everybody. I'm in beneficials with different views, you know, from the more hawkish to more double side. Can probably find good news in this report Yeah Mono let's pick up on that point specifically on the wage front is Brian said you know the big concern here has been about wage growth and employers continuing to have to sort of shell out because of the type pool mark at Hey What is that print that I tell you Make too much of it. The narrative that's kind of building around inflation may have peaked. This wage growth number this morning supports that to some extent. You know the five. Two% slightly below the expectation of five. Three% on your basis.

555,"To support their view so I think the decision for the September meeting and we've heard fede officials in recent weeks you know sort of putting out there the possibility of either another 50 basis point 75 basis point hike. I think it's really gonna ultimately come down to to the upcoming CPI report. You know I think that's really what's gonna be likely to push beneficials in one direction or another. More same question. Do you think 5075, in the next meeting? Yeah, you know, look, I think we are getting an elevated Federate hike in September whether it's 50 or 75. I think to that point, the the September 13 CPI report will probably be the final determinant. You know, generally, I think we're looking at about 150 basis points, more of Fed tightening until we get to a terminal rate of 375 to four% and interestingly of course markets are now expecting a fed pause but no longer a fed pivot in 2023 and so I think you know the markets and the fed have become much more in line as of late and I think the the good thing about that is it sets us up nicely as we head into 2023 with the potential fed Eyes and a potential post midterm election market which historically has been a nice setup so near volatility probably likely as a fed continues this rate hiking cycle but that could lead to some opportunities for the year ahead.

Yes I think the impact right now is primarily isolated to in video they made GP chips that are widely used by the industry for machine learning in AI training the implications here is you know the what the US wants to limit China Ability to develop kind of military applications with it. There are some broader implications. I would say generally all pretty negative. I would say one this is only gonna push China to more regionalize their vertical semiconductors supply chain which is gonna be inefficient for the broader It's also gonna limit demand for some of the other chip makers that supply into that data center server supply chain in terms of impacting EMD I think it's actually pretty minimal for AMD they're GPO data centers roughly about one% of revenues they're not Widely as widely as adopted as in video for machine learning in AI at this point in time but the impact right now is really focused on in video ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinYGgnrDs8,47,2022-09-06 17:01:23

His end game is to go move forward to expand to attack to to take territory to declare victories but he has to keep on going no matter what it is and and this is just part of that process and it and it's not like it just started now. I mean, the most recent version of this just started now. He was feeling under pressure 1008 that's when he invaded Georgia In 2014 the same thing he took Crimea And so this is this is a long process of him trying to stay in power as a dictator and the most scary part of this whole He will stop so let's just say that that he's successful in Ukraine and and that's a very big question because the Ukrainians are valuingly fighting back but let's say he was successful in Ukraine that's not the end of his story He would then go to other countries. Maybe the easy ones, maybe the hard ones, maybe it grabs mold over at some point. But his, his, the ultimate goal for him Which means Estonia or Lapiania or Poland And then to test out something that has never been tested before which is are we ready to go to war is the United States ready to go to war with Russia to protect Estonia a country of a one 1 million people that that probably you know two% of Americans could locate on a map are we ready to do that or are we not Any and he's taken the bad They were not.

That's just what anyone would do and certainly the Russians will do that. So, we need to sanction the other 30% of the banks and A lot of people ask me why why are those banks protected then I can imagine that there was some you know ugly backroom deal with you know in a smokey room where somebody said we have an interest there don't do that but so those other 30% of the banks need to be sanctioned I'm disconnected from Swift and then the the most important part of the whole exercise is Vladimir Putin's own money needs to be hit Oligarchs who look after it And so we need to freeze the assets of the oligarchs in the west And a lot of announcements have been made the best that's the intention A few oligarchs about have been added to the various EU US UK sanctions lists But that needs to be done in a much more coordinated manner cuz there's different oligarchs in the US that are been sanctioned in the EU and different ones in the U then UK.

And is this effective Well, in a certain way, I would almost argue it's more effective because okay, so the, you know, the sanctions lists are important, government activities, important, but if every western company Stops doing business with the Russians. It's it's it's really dramatic. I remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for Sergey Magnitsky. My murdered lawyer. One of the first people people I met with I was I was in South Africa and I met with Who is one of the people involved in the one of the main people involved in the antipartide movement. I'd watched him movie called Tri Freedom and and she was one of the characters in the movie and I and I met with her shortly after her game. I guess he was murdered and we talked. And we talked about how they ended apartheid and she said it was all about Disinvesting from South Africa that when they became financially isolated that's when it became too much and so I think this is really really important and I think this is probably you know as I look at the next steps what can we do next when we watch these atrocities unfold in Ukraine I think it's just to to pressure every single Western business to To stop doing business to stop supplying goods to stop supplying services to Russia.

What are you already seeing in terms of demand as we head into the fall and winter? Thanks for having me. Yeah, the the this weekend was okay.

You know, I dropped my kids off to school You know people this is really gonna be the business travel season so that's the big question mark for live investments just how strong is it gonna be you know one thing that we we've been looking at a fair bit is airlines with international exposure should be okay we've seen you know international demand remain pretty robust For quite some time. The dollar index is at all time guys. So, you know, you're getting more for what you're doing internationally. So, you know, that's that's an encouraging sign but yeah, the real question mark is really around. No, business travel. You know, we struggle with the idea just around capacity right now. As you mentioned, there were a lot of delays over the weekend. Delays are better than cancellations. We'll obviously not great. But you know, we're getting we're we're moving in the right direction, I guess And so, you know, there's still a lot of uncertainty about 2023 and what that's gonna look like. Our preference right now is airlines that are that are willing to be smaller for longer. Or are the ones that are gonna perform the best. You know, that's the delt is the world. Southwest to some extent in Alaska on air group is is their other topic Conor we've been talking all morning long about rising energy prices in Europe because of what's going on there with Russia and as it battles the eurozone you don't think that's going to have an impact Those international focused airlines.

605,"At this point did the last few weeks mean Stocks and maybe also the bond market have now gotten that message. They're beginning to get it but i don't think they have fully embraced it yet. So one way that we look at that is by looking at the equity market PE multiples. If we look at what happened in the month of August The PE only contracted a few percent if the market really believe that rates were going to remain higher for longer the PE would have contracted by more than that so we think the bond market is closer to pricing it in than the stock market is the stock market is still trying very hard to be optimistic so we still think We we're likely to see continued volatility The realization continues to grind into investors that rates will stay higher for longer. Well, then Allen, how do you navigate this environment? What moves should you be making and not making to portfolios? What we're doing is we are reducing and have been for several months now exposure to economically sensitive areas like retail which is facing such an inventory correction at the moment as well as shifting consumer demand Like some areas of energy where we may see gas prices and oil prices continue their their modest decline And we're also reducing exposure to poem areas such as the home Retailers and home builders etcetera and where we're increasing exposure our classically defensive areas areas like defense Areas like pharma and areas like consumer staples. So we don't think it's too late to be making those shifts. As I said we've been making them for a few months but we still think that's the right move to be making. And when you look at defensive groups how I mean when rates go higher Do they just sort of navigate that environment better they more resistant in that environment?

Our own electricity prices Can I take this is something people miss when they think about Slowing the US economy down there's a lot of focus on fed policy and the fact that higher interest rates will impact US household spending the reality is higher energy prices have a much more direct impact on US household spending For most households the top quartile are gonna be more than wealthier folks are gonna be more impacted by higher interest rates but everybody else really higher energy prices is very punitive and it's not just the prices at the pump we have to look across the board ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffamO5bzvOk,38,2022-09-07 16:32:15

You don't expect inflation to come down below a certain percentage by the end of this year, next year. What's going on? What is it gonna take to see a transmission such that inflation reaches the Fed's goal here of two%? Well, this is a key question that the transmission mechanism is as follows. If the money supply changes, there there's a delay between the change and the money supply and inflation and this lag is long and variable. It last about 12 to 24 months. That can stretch out actually to 3 years. What we have had is this huge increase in the money supply The way I like to look at it is think of a bathtub a monetary bathtub so so the money goes in the bathtub and and the money supplies increase since February of 2020 by about 31% so that money goes Drains out of two drains one is Is needed to accommodate real economic growth and activities so that drains some of it out and then you have another drain that's So those drains have drained some of that 31% out but your left with a bot 20% The bathtub and where does that go?

So I, yeah, par for the course here that we're having airline delays here That has come to this that an airline removing service potentially from one of the largest airports in the US. Yeah and this comes also as the airlines are trying to sort of Retain some capacity discipline even as we have seen this big up chicken demand from flyers and another part of the backdrop here is that United Airlines reported this morning that operating revenue is gonna be up about 12% for this quarter and it might fly slightly more than previously planned so an a little bit of In capacity there. So, they say exiting a robust summer. The company continues to see a strong demand environment. So, we'll see how the JFK fights please into all of that and what ends up happening there.

So, of course, in that sense, none of this high inflation that we see around the world now would have happened without the pandemic.

So, The pandemic. You know, as I just discussed, it is very important that inflation expectations remain anchored. I think the evidence today is that if you look at longer term expectations Households, businesses, and forecasters and also markets. You'll see that they are pretty well anchored around two%. Of course, short-term expectations Or higher because of high current inflation and also the clock is ticking as I mentioned the longer Inflation remains well above target the the greater the concern that the public will start to just naturally incorporate higher inflation into its economic decision making and our job Is to make sure that doesn't happen and we're committed to doing that job. It seems to me there's a chance. There's there's a real risk that the labor market Does that create a risk that takes some of the ability to manage Process out of your hands.

So, it it is very much our view and my view that we need to act now forthrightly strongly as we have been doing and we need to keep at it until the job is done To avoid that we think we can avoid the the kind of very high social cost that that Paul Volker and the Fed had to bring into play in order to get inflation back down and set us up then for for a long period of prostability You know that that that speech that the point really there was to deliver a speech that was narrowly focused on inflation more direct and a lot shorter than a typical Jackson Whole speech and I thought that what was appropriate was a very you know kinda concise Focus message to your question the message really was that the Fed has and accepts responsibility for priability by which we mean two% inflation over time That again. Inflation remains well above target the greater the risk at the public does begin to see higher inflation as the norm and that has the capacity to really raise the cost of of getting inflation down So, finally, history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.

The other products are excellent products by the way. I just wanna be very clear. A lot of those we expected but I think this this watch ultra, you know, is really gonna go after a different crowd and I I'd say watch for some some marketing to follow very, very soon to really target that audience. Hey, On the phone front do you think what apple is rolling out is enough to sort of hold its position against the likes of Samsung I think so. I don't think it gains more but I don't think it loses anything.

So, it it is very much our view and my view that we need to act now forthrightly strongly as we have been doing and we need to keep at it until the job is done To avoid that we think we can avoid the the kind of very high social cost that that Paul Voker and the Fed had to bring into play in order to get inflation back down and set us up then for for a long period of prostability You know that that that speech that the point really there was to deliver a speech that was narrowly focused on inflation more direct and a lot shorter than a typical Jackson Hull speech and I thought that what was appropriate was a very you know kinda concise Focus message to your question the message really was that the Fed has and accepts responsibility for price stability by which we mean two% inflation over time The longer inflation remains well above target the greater the risk at the public does begin to see higher inflation as the norm and that has the capacity to really raise the cost of of getting inflation down so finally history cautions strongly against premature Loosening policy.

I didn't know that delete had that They're Back and forth charging thing to the car and then in peak times taking power from the car to the bridge and like you mentioned in place of California where the leaf cells actually pretty well this is a big deal for owners that that wanna do something more to alleviate that Big deal that maybe hopefully they can start adding to the grid right now using leafs as a power source. Yeah, we have the San Jose Mayor on yesterday saying that he believes that Evie's could actually be a really important power source in the future What some of the streams they've had out there.

Early December. Yeah, how effective do you think that price cap can be? We're talking about Gseven nations that have already imposed some pretty strict sanctions on Russia. They're still too big out liars in China as well as India. That's right. Those those are the key questions. How China and India will react to the price cap but the Gseven and and it's and his friends and her eyes obviously the Europeans, the Japan. Agreed oil than Brent for example. So this is increasing that discount. It it is certainly doable. The details and implementation are being worked out now. A couple of months to do that remains to be seen if China and India wanna pay more than they're going rate for rush now well they can do that if they want not sure why they would want to do that they don't typically do that it typically paid market rate And the G seven has the buying power to introduce this differential On Russian oil. So, I I I think the prospects here are are quite promising. What do you think the the one risk is when we talk about the risk of global economy that the market is overlooking I mean we we've hit on some of the key issues we've been talking about what what's happening in China with the oh COVID palsy over in Europe here in the US as well but What do you think that maybe we're we're missing here in terms of what could be a significant risk ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ciqE_NO8gk,14,2022-09-08 15:44:33

Today the labor market is Carol Bruner who spoke at Kato's first monetary conference pointed to the importance. According to Brunor quote we neither we suffer neither under total ignorance nor do we enjoy full knowledge. A non activist that is rules based Regime emerges under the circumstances as the safest strategy It does not assure us that economic fluctuations will be avoided But it will assure us that monetary policy Impose additional uncertainties on the marketplace.

At a foreman Forum hosted by the ECB in June. Bitch, German, Jerome Paul stated quote We now understand better a little we understand about inflation go school I hope today's conference will help shed light And the causes of inflation and provide positive lessons for improving monetary policy. Before moving to the Little J Bowen Jr. And Duval Bowen family foundation for supporting today's event. I'd also like to thank Kato's excellent staff for helping with the conference Especially Nick Anthony and Keana Graham as well as David Tassie and Jonathan Fields. Finally thanks to all our speakers and moderators for taking time from your busy schedules to join us Now let's begin with Fed Sherman J Paul and Peter Getler president and CEO of the Cato is too. Thank you Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Before proceeding I wanna offer my congratulations to you Jim 2 weeks ago at Jackson hole 10 days ago Would Paul Volker did and the Fed did to finally get inflation under control followed several failed attempts to get inflation under control and and what had happened over the course of that long period of the great inflation is that the public had really come to think of higher inflation as the norm And to expected to continue and that's what what made it so hard To get inflation down in that case. So, it it is very much our view and my view that we need to act now forthrightly strongly as we have been doing and we need to keep at it until the job is done To avoid that we think we can avoid the the kind of very high social cost that that Paul Voker and the Fed had to bring into play in order to get inflation back down and set us up then for for a long period of prostability You know that that that speech that the point really there was to deliver a speech that was narrowly focused on inflation more direct and a lot shorter than a typical Jackson Whole speech and I thought that what was appropriate was a very you know kinda concise Focus message to your question the message really was that the Fed has and accepts responsibility for price ability by which we mean two% inflation over time The longer inflation remains well above target the greater the risk at the public does begin to see higher inflation as the norm and that has the capacity to really raise the cost of of getting inflation down so finally history cautions strongly against prematurely ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lk7w3OVZ_U,780,2022-09-08 16:19:39

It'll come down in the second half of this year. We're looking inflation of two. One% next year. So in our view with the slowing economy next year inflation getting Under control.

So, that's definitely reflective when you see the pound at these multi-year lows.

Now, I'm talking about the average consumer, even if it's an outdoorsy person that you would go in the areas without self service.

Alright, that's bad for the Fed. Stocks going down. That is good and why is that? That's because financial conditions that something the fed is trying to keep a rain on a lid on when those are Easy when stocks are going up too much when bond spreads her narrow it's easy to borrow money that is not the fittest friend to do with inflation so big underlying underscore here for the markets are the fed really really means it.

So, 70% roughly have a specific number of days they expect people in the office. 30% are saying whatever makes the most sense for you.

The reality is employees expect flexibility where they work nowadays. It's gone from a privilege to a right that expectation that a lot of employees have.

They wanna have control over what they do, what they work on, when they work on it And if you can communicate to those candidates on the labor market that you're giving them as much flexibility as possible you're actually more attractive employer So, those companies that offer more radical flexibility, it's gonna be easier for them to attract and retain employees compared to those that put specific constraints or have specific plans on the number of days that people have to be in the office.

It's not only you share that pessimism. I think it will be a bit As well as difficult for stocks you know I think We have a fad that's committed to fighting inflation which will be good in terms of getting inflation down but the path there it can be tumultuous certainly we do expect to see further right hikes and as soon as the next FLMC meeting later this So now how aggressive do you expect the fed not necessarily to be in September but looking out further to October could we see another Aggressive hike or saying about 50 beasts points or potentially more. Yes you know we are expecting a 75 later this month and we do think that that is committed we heard it earlier today too from Chara Powell that you know and when you think about their dual mandate between you know keeping employments in As well as curbing inflation. They really have done a good job on the employment perspective and so it makes sense that they are dedicated to getting inflation down. It's very high today. And even with all the effort and the expected further hikes.

One, it Great transparency with regard to the price that those in the price cap coalition are willing to pay and put countries like India, indonesia, countries throughout Asia, and a better position to negotiate lower prices with the Russians going forward. We've already seen that Russia's negotiating with some countries prices as low as with a 30% On the current price of oil in light of the coming press cap and the six package we've also heard from a number of countries that are interested in joining the price cap coalition that ended that the Russians are approaching them looking for new homes for their oil to go and our second goal is going to be that if Russia can't use the services provided by Countries To make it far more expensive for them to find services to use to ship their oil and that again will reduce their revenues.

Rad, good to talk to you Lot to pass through based on those headlines we got over from the EU. Let's start with that oil price cap though. If it is really about The pain on consumers how effective do you think something like this can be and keeping those prices capped It really does depend on what the price cat looks like and you know, fundamentally, what punitive measures can be brought to bear and the price cap, you know, on the oil side is really trying to get Industrial countries out of a bind. When it's when it agreed to its sanctions package in June Decided to implement Cargo from Russia on Sibong cargos from Russia and that's really what the oil price cap is designed to unwind it's to link exemptions to that that insurance ban by having countries agreeing to lower revenue now you know ultimately You've seen Justifications in Russian flowers you've seen sort of adjustments in Russian flows over the last 6 months so it depends on what Asia does and at the end of the day weather two things one weather Asia can be convinced and particularly China and India can be But more importantly whether there are caveats made if there are caviars made or Asia or Asian buyers are allowed to adjust their prices or simply align their prices then they're disruption to Russian crude maybe fairly minimal as I say that ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4BMLs65f4Y,68,2022-09-09 18:38:59

So then it's it's worth differentiating between crude oil and products in this one and and you know the administration has had a tendency to get the two mixed up when it's when it's addressed this debate. But looking Again if if Price cap fundamentally is put in place and all it does is Sanctify or at least make official you know the the changes in flows that are we're already seeing then the market isn't gonna be short crude if it does start to be disruptive if there Unit additional punitive measures there. I mean again which haven't been discussed but something like secondary sanctions to force the likes of India and China to abide by To abide by it then you face it a greater problem but at the end of the day I go back to my original point which is you know what the US is doing what the G seven is doing is trying to get itself out of a bind it once it's cake and it wants to While not having to face the the consequences and the price consequences in the midst of a global energy crisis that is only ballooning ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4BMLs65f4Y,69,2022-09-09 18:43:19

So, Ethereum was launched as approval work blockchain which is what's considered the consensus algorithm that's used to kinda secure the network Bitcoin has a proof of work consensus mechanism so does a theorium there's been a lot of Hi criticisms of proof of work mainly environmental concerns there's also speed concerns and so several years ago the Ethereum Foundation decided that on its road map they really needed to pivot and institute a proof of stake can send this mechanism So they basically started out on multi year road map where they would solely upgrade the Ethereum blockchain very carefully so it's not to break anything Get to that proof of steak state. So, the merge basically represents Ethereum going completely from proof of work to proof of steak and that is set to happen this Wednesday. Hey Katie yeah you know we have this the the CPI coming out tomorrow Biggest event this week and you know perhaps this quarter I was really curious if you could sort of explain how the US CPI and the merge together might sort of play into investing decision making this week around cryptocurrency it's obviously the Environment is kind of driven cryptocurrencies for most of this year.

But just to follow up Sorry just a photo there are there are businesses of course that have to be synced to that so there is an element to the merge that doesn't really have to do with the technological side of what the developers have done so would you just sort of add is there anything else that you know businesses should be mindful of a They can be expected there Definitely there are there are definitely a concerns around some of the applications that are built on top of Ethereum and how those are going to behave during the merge.

I mean, I know developers have been working on this effort for months obviously But you know, it's such a big project and there's billions of dollars on the line. So, Yeah David this is definitely a misconception at this point there's definitely not much that can kinda go wrong from a technological standpoint the Ethereum developers have done several test nets which are basically like You know, pre pre testing. I've done on shadow networks that aren't, you know, on the real full network. Those have gone off completely smoothly. They've had maybe some like issues with kind of node sinking here and there, but that was quickly corrected within a few minutes. In addition, they did the first part actually of the merge hard fork last Monday and that went through fine without a hitch. So no, we're not actually expecting any issues around the merge. You know, the last estimate that I read was that it was going to happen at about maybe 5 o'clock Pacific on Wednesday. So, all eyes are you know, on that date and time. But just to follow Sorry just a photo there are there are businesses of course that have to be synced to that so there is an element to the merge that doesn't really have to do with the technological side of what the developers have done so would you just sort of add is there anything else that you know businesses should be mindful of a They can be expected there ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCd1ifStfnk,69,2022-09-12 18:41:51

More of that good side of inflation You've seen some of that pricing come down. So, yeah, I think, you know, when even when you control for inflation, you're still seeing quantity increases. You're still gonna be seeing consumers going out there and spending. And it'll be really fascinating to watch those decisions that they make in a sense of what they spend on, when they spend, where are they spend, all of that, I think Gonna be fasting as we see that evolve and as we look at the data. And you know, Michelle, I'm thinking back to where we were a year ago. We had all those warnings from retailers saying that supply may not be there. Come holiday season. You gotta get your shopping in early. That kind of push the timeline Holiday season this year we're hearing about retailers with a lot of inventory left deep discounts that are out there That sort of shift the timeline and what are we talking about in terms of the bargain shopping that's likely to be had because of the high levels of inventory? Sure. So, I mean, I still think from the last 2 years is kind of, you know, extension of a holiday season.

In Katie at this point it's sort of a moving target but it looks like the Ethereum the merge will be completed in less than 3 days at this point and on the technical side what sort of hiccups are you anticipating could realistically happen at this stage I mean I know Operas have been working on this effort for months But you know, it's such a big project and there's billions of dollars on the line.

1149,"But beyond that do I guess I wanna back up for just a second Thomas. Why are we expecting inflation to come down more It's not happening at the rate that we expected or hoped. So I think that expectations that inflation you know I I hate to use the word transitory because it's been kind of you know demonized in in the last 18 months but you know we there is still this sort of long held view that inflation is not a sustainable thing that can be generated by the US economy and that really is sort of a memory of past cy And yet we had virtually known flation over the course of Of a decade. So, I think it was reasonable. Oh, to assume that that was going to continue. You know, we pump the economy full stimulus both monitoring fiscal after COVID, initially, Wasn't really that much inflation but now as the economy has you know had to sort of restart itself and there's been a lot of supply constraints specifically in in labor at this point. It's been much stickier. And and quite honestly you know that The labor market has held up very well. Wage growth is continued and there's it's it's not as much of a supply store anymore. It's really demand driven and that's much more difficult to contain once it's started to get sort of out of control There have been calls or anticipations for the unemployment rate there to tick higher even if we are to see some type of soft landing constructed but I mean the odds of that you know it depends upon who you ask at this point and Where are you expecting the employment situation to trend towards ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASlvYsGqCTg,7,2022-09-14 14:15:21

They actually show some significant signs of of reaccelerating. You know, I mean, specific to, you know, some of the elements of the CPR report that are mentioned For years on on that specific category and you know just as we see gas prices come off from the highs and June and July it looks like you're starting to see Shift is you know consumers are are immediately turning that savings around and spending it on other things and retailers are seeing that they have more pricing power than they thought in order to get that down really gonna need to see interest rate That rise very significantly and the Fed can't afford to take their foot off the accelerator at this point. But is it that they're spending on on those other things? Question with the mindset of is it that they're actually spending cash that they're saving from the gas prices coming down on other things or are they just spending on other things and it's showing up and spending but it's really kind of that credit spending and what what type of kind of scenario does that create in this broader economic equation Yeah we've seen some mixed signals on that. It recent consumer credit data has been The the biggest increases we've seen on a monthly basis Several years if not I believe one would recently was actually a record high but at the same time if we look at household balance sheets there's still a massive amount of accumulated savings amongst households from the early days of the pandemic that is is still sitting there ready to be to be spent ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASlvYsGqCTg,8,2022-09-14 14:19:41

So, I write the book a little bit the Russian approach is a variation on the one that you mentioned with Dan Bruke and the J and J one. It's not quite as good and frankly, we just heard how much data that's reliable. It doesn't help that Putin himself didn't take the vaccine from Revolutionary as it is it just Is so much better than these other vaccines How come Merk and Santa Fe and other companies that are known as leaders in this space We're not at the four It's a great question and frankly, when I started researching this book, iconic expected the vaccine giants to be the ones to save us. I mean, markers the one that created the MMR vaccine that we're GSK and yet these are About an internal rift within work about whether to pursue a vaccine for COVID-19 or not.

Maybe they have their inventory and warehouses. It's not costing them that much.

1272,"Alright and just moving on to I wanna take a look at HYG the credit market this is an ETF that tracks high yield I was watching this with particular interest in that in that rally that we had in the first part of August then we saw a big decline it was one of the leaders in Climb one of the lagers in that rise. How important is this chart to you and can you break down some of the technicals here? Yeah I think it's extremely important it's a great point and and I think when people think back they have the muscle memory of 2008 and prior crisis mean credit is at the heart of those major market drawdowns not the 25% off the top isn't a major draw down but that's more consistent Traditional bear market in order to get a bigger crisis type decline in the mid 30s and perhaps even 40 plus percent as we saw on the financial crisis typically in an un And credit would be one of those key catalysts so to create a double bond I'm here in the HYG or the JNK some of those very well followed high yield ETF is critical and I think that's Exactly what's happening. So, again, I believe the HYG is a double bottom, the J and K is a double bottom, and take it a step further whether we look in munies or preferred, you're talking about a triple bottom and things like the MUB municipal bondy TF. So, I do think it's a key cog in that bullish call but again, my call is that we are bottoming on the credit side. Noted here and I wanted to keep it with credit but specifically the sovereigns and we got the 10 year yield three. Five% a huge big technical level potentially a double top here I don't know because the federal funds projected Somewhere about a percentage point higher it's 100 basis points what are you reading in the chart of the tenure right now ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PgkBjIdMDI,27,2022-09-15 15:39:51

Specifically because it hurts lower income or so much more than higher income earners, right? And there's really very little that can be done to support those folks If inflation is gonna persist at that level indefinitely.

Really not just labor. It's not just rising wages but there's a lot of different dynamics that I think are contributing to the increase in prices. Whether it's supply chain complications. Yes, labor issues but sometimes lack of labor. A lack of the ability to be able to work consistently in their jobs. Which is Tie to pandemic controls and also there's a real distinction to be made between inflation and price gouging and there's a lot of evidence that particularly industries with high concentrations of corporate concentrations whether it's almost all agopoly Or industries.

1300,"MKM partners chief economist macro strategist here. Thanks so much for joining us here this morning, Michael. You know, first and foremost, when you think about the Fed and and what you've said and what you kind of have wrapped up to be the reactive nature of the Fed rather than proactive, what is the best way that the Fed could be proactive as as they've been kinda At this point Yeah, thanks for having me on. So, I think the best thing they could do would be to focus on forward looking In reading indicators we have a bit of a problem here with the chasing backward looking information They're very focused on things like wages and rents and services inflation. Those are all very important variables. But they don't move first when economic conditions change because many of those prices are tied to leases in contracts so we have a big problem that that is driving the vehicle looking through the rear view mirror and it puts us into Rebounded was coming focusing on those la Indicators gave them a false set of comfort so you all probably remember the temporary transitory in Rolio And now just the opposite is the setup with the fade getting aggressive here and persisting with aggressive policy likely to to take take it too far in in the creator Economic upheaval next year.

Michael doesn't seem like the vets listening to you. Saying this stuff i mean if the fed was paying attention to the indicators that you're talking about Would there not be a 75? I mean, should the fed not raise 75 basis points? Next week, should it pause after that or at some point? Like, if they were doing what you're suggesting, what then would the the rate increase strategy look like or not rate Strategy. Yeah well if they were looking forward instead of backward then I think they would have limited the easing they would not have persisted with the short rated oh for so long they would have started more sooner and more aggressively on the rate hikes and the balance sheet reduction so we wouldn't be Situation now where they're going really aggressively. But I guess now that we're here, now what how can they correct if they were going to correct for those mistakes made in the past? Hey Hey Facebook slow it down Alright, there.

They haven't been delivered yet in in mass. Right. And so much of that has been online reservations. So, what is the pivot that they're expect Go over to dealerships. That's a good question. So, one of the things that he that that probably wanted to address was, hey, we already put people gotta have fixed pricing. Gotta go to order the vehicle and that's what you pay for. That's what tells the works, right? So, with the dealer structure as it is, dealers can set pricing but they'd, but Ford is on them, whatever price you put online, that is the final price you cannot change that Bars can crash up across deals for cheaper cars but once that price on the website that's it you cannot add any kind of mark ups and things like that. So, they wanna make that process, yes, yeah. So, between that and these fees that they're asking the dealers to pay, are are they gonna get push From the dealers. I mean, the dealer network is really important still to Yeah I mean I bet you'll see a certain percentage of them so you know what we don't want them we'll just stick with the traditional cars that the F one 50s the Mustangs of as we just saw and sell gas part and then you can revisit that later you can actually you know what 5 years time you can say Ford can we revisit this certification and they can Open that up apparently.

Really Position is very strongly for the future. And what is that new conversation package look like? So we engaged PWC to do a really significant piece of benchmarking work for us around our instructor compensation earlier on this year what that Told us was that we had somewhat of an unbalance between the across the pay spectrum so we found that there were some instructors who were paying a fairly significant premium versus our competitive market And others who were not quite at market minimum. We've been very proud of the fact that for many years we have paid a premium to our instructors. We have rockstar instructors at their the best in the world. And we will continue to pay a premium to the market. What we're seeking to do with the new compensation plan. It's just read Start plan to some extent. So, reducing the premium amongst our most senior instructors and bringing a number of others up. So, it benefits very many across the organization. What is the feedback been like so far? Have you gotten any feedback yet? Well, just announced. Hey, guys. Hey, it's kind of a very, very current news and so, what I will tell you is, I don't think I've ever worked at any company where people just can't wheels when you Your compensation is at risk of being reduced somewhat but of course those that are receiving a compensation increase the thrill In Evelyn what is it been like just the experience here especially over the last 6 to 12 months in recruiting instructors because we are obviously facing a massive labor shortage one that is affecting the fitness industry have you guys been having a Get a new instructor through your doors.

Of course as behaviors change as people return to the office. The balance of what is convenient might change. That inclination of the last couple of years of course has been to work out at home. But as we return to the office they'll probably start coming into the studio as well. So we'll see behaviors change. But the ecosys Is what's important. Making sure that we are where our consumers want us to be. What about differentiating yourself from some of the competitors out there because you are going after the same writers in a lot of of a lot of instances. What has happened like and I guess What type of risk does this potentially post to your business It is I mean it's very difficult for me to comment on what other organisations are doing but look what I can say about soul cycle is the soul cycle experience is truly unique. There is more division than unity in the world right now. What we are thinking consumers seek is human connection and community. And they are Cycle superpowers. So for all those I see a very exciting future as the world gets back to normal as we see people coming back to the studios connecting with each other So excited to be back as a community. That presents an abundance of opportunity for the business as we And even speaking of the future there we have had we have had soul cycle shelf plans to go public in the past lots of speculation about whether or not that is in the pipeline what do you think? ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PgkBjIdMDI,85,2022-09-15 19:53:08

It doesn't have a lot of cash flow so it's not a value stock.

Public opinion showed very strong support for pushing back on Russia, Support material and weapons for the Ukrainian government but the US public was very reticent and does not want to engage Russia directly On the ground and what Biden indicated yesterday is that at least his administration seems like they wanna make that commitment that is something new and I think that is a bit considered a bit of an es Particularly by the Chinese government And can you talk a little bit about that escalation because I know that euros had come out with a report back in July about the probability of conflict in Taiwan Also a given speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan I mean how does this all play out when you're talking about conflict there? Yeah, and to be clear, you know, we don't think there's gonna be a military conflict between US and China over Taiwan, anytime soon but The situation is getting more tense. You've got China who's making military preparations to take over the island and may have the ability to do so within the next several years.

A lot has shifted since then as a result of the concerns around energy. What do you think is gonna be a central message? You know, I think Biden goes to this meeting actually with a lot to say. The US passed probably the most significant climate spending bill in its history and it really, you know, in the inflation reduction act. It's gonna be dedicating hundreds Millions of dollars to a clean energy transition over the next 10 years primarily in the private sector through subsidies for private sector activity, tax credits, and loan guarantees in the like and I think that gives Biden a lot to talk about especially in the context where European nations are now in their short Looking at ways they can, you know, keep the lights on throughout the winter due to gas shortages and spiking electricity prices but in the long run, you know, the European countries still have this commitment to decarbonization but where I think the real interesting topic is gonna be this week is in the developing world Finance these kind of commitments I think you're gonna see the UN and the developing world really hammer a lot on the developed world to try to contribute Help with their both climate transition and also climate resiliency and I think that's gonna be one of the big themes of the UN this week.

When you see these incredibly high prices that certainly means that demand slows down but when you add to that higher interest rates which also increases borrowing costs. That's a two fold. So that you could start to see demand slowing down rather dramatically Most likely next year we already see it in housing as you just had mentioned we start to we'll start to likely see the other areas and when demand Down.

Public opinion showed very strong support for pushing back on Russia, Support material and weapons for the Ukrainian government but the US public was very reticent and does not want to engage Russia directly Troops on the ground and what Biden indicated yesterday is that at least his administration seems like they be willing to make that commitment that is something new and I think that is a would be considered a bit of an escal Particularly by the Chinese government And can you talk a little bit about that escalation because I know that erase had come out with a report back in July about the probability of conflict in Taiwan especially also a given Conflict there. Yeah, and to be clear, you know, we don't think there's gonna be a military conflict between US and China over Taiwan, anytime soon, but The situation is getting more tense.

You know, I think in an era like this We're inflation is running and it levels that we haven't seen in 40 years, right? I think much more of it is about how low the price point goes and much less of it is actually about the the type of attic experience that the consumer gets. You know, I would suspect that you know, Netflix has a history of sort of testing and learning, and going slow, and so I think whatever you see in terms of the attic experience early on is probably not indicative of the terminal urine answer.

You know we don't think that we're going to see a negative number in the third quarter the big swing factor is going to be inventories and given that we had a big drag from the inventory number in the first and the second quarter those 12 unwind themselves in subsequent quarters so if Maybe it's going to there might be some superficial strength in the third quarter number keeping it positive mainly due that to that inventory swing number what we like to do track is the gross domestic income instead of gross domestic product and that's just kind of a different way of looking at the same coin it's Are you looking at what's produced or at the income that's generated based off of selling what's been produced and that GDI or gross domestic income number has been more positive and a little bit more stable and we think that that's perhaps a bit more indicative of the underlying trend which unfortunately is still downwards but not yet make it If I need to talk about the likelihood of new lows at least for the S and P For some silver lining here what could be the catalyst that turns things around for equities here ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmKj2Mc7hTs,75,2022-09-20 19:12:59
