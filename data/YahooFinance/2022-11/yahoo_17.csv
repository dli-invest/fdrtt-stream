4607," do to reinvigorate the revenue line as they continue to pour money into the metaverse. But to me, you know, this is very similar to what we saw with second life almost a decade ago, where there was an initial spur and then it fizzled. The question that I struggle with when it comes to the metaverse is what is the killer app? Why will people go and continue to go in mass and how do they drive revenue? Not just meta, but really anybody. And I don't think it's really the, I don't think the answer is there yet. Just to follow on that with the kind of present nature of the vacuum of easy money policies, does the metaverse actually become a reality? I think it, well, look, anytime we have these new technologies, right? And I'm going to date myself here a little bit Brad. So back in 1999, 2000, when I was a younger man, I heard all about 3G, 3G is coming, 3G is going to revolutionize everything. And it's going to be here next year. And it took several years for 3G not only to really have the networks built the devices there, but for the applications to emerge that really drove the incremental average revenue per user that carriers were booking. So I think we're going to see that again. You know, and will it happen? Yes, I think like autonomous cars and everything else at the timeline is just going to be a lot longer than we originally think. 3G in second life, you're really taking me back here. So within technology, then what is more attractive to you? If you're looking specifically in that, you know, does it, does it pay to stay more boring for lack of a better word right now? Well, you know, it's an interesting question. And I say that because, you know, over the last several months, you know, in the actual, excuse me, action alerts plus portfolio that we run for the street, we've actually exited a number of technology companies. You know, when we took the portfolio over, it was over invested in technology. You know, again, this was about a year ago. And we've whittled that away. And the landscape, I think, is a little murky right now to be kind. You know, we heard what AMD said last night. Data Center looks like it's holding up better. PC continues to be worse. You know, we're hearing repeated conversations about slowing smartphone sales. So it's hard to get excited about technology. And I know some people will come out and they'll say, well, you know, these stocks are cheap. And my reply is Brian will probably guess is, you know, when I put my analyst hat on is, well, how are they cheap when I don't really know what the E is or I don't know what the S is in price to sales because those numbers are coming down. So I, you know, I want to like technology because it does have a lot of, you know, disruptive and productivity plays. But I don't think we're there yet, Julie. Chris, what about industrials then? So industrials are an interesting way to look at it. You know, I used to cover that back in my early days. And it's a very wide category. You know, so you can have everything from trucks and rails to construction equipment and ag equipment. I think those latter two are a lot more interesting. Construction equipment, you know, caterpillar, plus some great numbers with your US construction business in the September quarter. We're starting to see some of the benefits flow through for demand on the Biden infrastructure law. That's why we like United Reynolds. We like Volcano materials as well. And that thesis was really confirmed this morning by what merit, excuse me, Martin Marietta had to say. So we like those. And then on the ag equipment side, look, farmer income is killing it. And when historically when that happens, they tend to replace their equipment. We also have, if you want to talk, you know, a little bit of technology, this real push and precision ag, you know, farmers are struggling with high fertilizer costs. I think that's going to accelerate that move. Interesting. Love to talk some precision ag. We'll do it at more length another time, Chris. Thanks so much, Chris Versace. I'm not even kidding. Tomato Gare Research Chief Investment Officer. Thank you. Thanks. Coming up, Sass is going to share the top things he said should terrify. I thought we went with worry, but okay, terrify school.

4608," [♪intro music plays === Today is indeed a Fed decision day in America. And while investors are obsessing over what the Fed says and doesn't say, the reality is that today's borrowing costs will be headed even higher after what the Fed unveils this afternoon. And that can spell bad news for retailers of all kinds. This holiday season saws at the great end. It's a little downer. Yeah. Well, it's the reality. So, first graphic here up in this is, you know, we're getting more or increasing signs of a lot of consumer weakness and it's starting to pick up. We've been talking about this past two weeks as these warnings have come. First, whirlpool, cut its guidance. You have Generac, the Generator Maker, warning about bloated inventories despite hurricane season, which theoretically should be causing more generator sales nonetheless. You have deck maker treks like we talked about yesterday. They're seeing sales or they saw sales in a third quarter flat out plunge, terrible outlook. American Express, when I talk to CEO Steven Squarie about a week and a half ago when they reported earnings, touch of caution in their full year outlook, not dire by anybody by any means, but still some red flags there. Bank of America, when I talked to Brian Monahan, the CEO of that company, noting that card spending through October, up 10%, but that was a little bit, just a little bit slow rate than what they saw coming out of the third quarter. Just a little red flags, but now we have a couple charts here. First off, speaking of B O V A, they put out a lot of good data on card spending. You could see really card spending among B O V A customers has started to weaken a little bit during the holiday season. Now, is it falling off a map? No, of course not. But when you're trying to put the pieces together and think about how you should be investing into the holiday season or investing into next year, you have to take all these pieces and think about them. I think consumers are also reminiscent of recessions passed or economic downturns passed and trying to take a different approach perhaps, reading their wallets, reading their credit as well to be able to sustain through a period like that, which means kind of the vacuum of some of that spending, at least in portion over time. It's not just, there's a lot of focus on low income shoppers, middle income consumers, but look at this next card from B O V A. It shows consumer sentiment by income group. Really, this card I think signifies that the plunge in the market this year may start to impact the market. Hold on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,2,2022-11-02 13:56:21
4609," Could this next chart from B of A, it shows consumer sentiment by income group. And really this chart I think signifies that the plunge in the market this year may start to impact consumer spending amongst wealthier households this holiday season. I haven't seen it within luxury goods. Maybe this SD-loader quarter today is a sign of what could be to come from hiring, come shoppers this holiday season. They'll still be out there shopping, but maybe not at the rate the market thinks. Yeah, and that's not surprising to me because of what's happened with the market, right? In other words, the top third of income have the most invested in stocks and stocks on the year have not done that well. Yeah, and lastly, we're tracking also city, this comes from city group, restaurant sales. Restaurant sales again, no big falling off a cliff here, but still a steady decline. We saw even McDonald's had a great quarter, but they're trafficked to the restaurants under a little bit pressure. We talked to Wingstop yesterday, good quarter, traffic a little bit under pressure. Dinebrads reported earnings today, I'm talking to CEO John Payton a little bit later on, but sales there were under a little pressure as well. I don't look like the traffic was up above 2019 in that chart now. Yeah, I mean relative to then, but it is not spiking, it is not going up, theoretically you want to see these things going up. Overall, here's my take, I think you're going to see more retail blowups coming very soon. As these companies report earnings throughout November, they're sent to saws coming out of the chimney. It will start early on next week. We'll get some results, I believe out of tapestry, some high income companies, and then Walmart target you name a little report. I mean, this is in line with what we heard from Lorraine Hutchison yesterday over at Bank of America, where she in particular was highlighting the inventory numbers, which continued to be alarming. She inspired me to do this because I, her comments were very on the mark. Yeah. On the mark. We had Santos saws there, but it had a Grinch tenor if you would have said so. Yeah, we should have had a green. I want to be Grinch, I just want to be happy. I just want to be happy guys. Well, then stop telling me, you're going to be terrible. I'm sorry, son. Coming up, we're going to break down some of the market action and more big earnings reports from Aramount, Match Group, and the A-Sports. It's in the game. Oh, I just, I was just going to do that show in the game. Here you go. Till the next reaction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,3,2022-11-02 14:00:33
4610," I'm fond of Apple's Food Box Super Bow my son have I been recording vlogs about this food box viewer and the internet as well T Guys. Is this a holiday house? Yes Hotnovs will do. Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saussing. Looks like Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. And we're just a few hours away from the Fed's latest decision on interest rates, FOMC officials for seeing hiking rates by another 75 basis points right now we're seeing markets really tiptoe in that Fed decision, all three major indices slightly in the red. Now here's what else is on tap for this hour. Tuning into Paramount. Yowl Finance's Ali Canal has some instant analysis on earnings results out of Paramount, which was also whacked by a Wells Fargo downgrade earlier in the week. And swiping the plastic, I talk with Mastercard CEO Michael Mebach on why he doesn't see a cold-filled holiday shopping season. And CEO ChatFest will also check in with the CEO's XPO, Travago and Rockwell automation to get a pulse on the global economy in two year end. Brad, over to you. All right, thanks so much. Big Fed day. We're going to get to the decision later on this afternoon. We're taking a look at how the major averages are moving on today's session going into that announcement. And then the press conference as well. You're seeing the Dow down by about four tenths of a percent. Let's set the mood with some candlesticks here and take a look at some of the larger movements that have been taking place there. Also getting just another look at some of the other major averages here on the day. We'll try to get markets back later on. Oh, there they are. Okay. Well, anyway, we've moved on. We're going over to sectors right now. Sector's on the day. As we had seen some major laggards throughout the early morning session. We've now seen all 11 S&P 500 sectors in negative territory, moving to negative territory. Financials has also slipped into the red. That's flat, but to the downside. Take a look as well at consumer discretionary as we've been tracking that. That's down by about three tenths of a percent. And with that in mind, want to take a look at some of the retail names as I've been tracking those. And you've got a lot of red in retail right now. Amazon hyperwifling, Walmart, down half a percent, some depot down four tenths of a percent. And take a look at the declines and lows moving lower on the day by about one percent. Also, you've got a host of others just to put this in broader perspective here at some of the declines on the day. You've got, of course, bedbath and beyond as well. That's down by about one percent right now. Julie, what do you think you very much, Brad? And we're also watching shares of Paramount that are down about nine percent after an earnings miss as investments in its content marketing and international expansions bite with a recap of the media giant's earnings and the broader streaming landscape. We've got our own alley canal joining us right now. So, Ali, tell us about this quarter and what stands out and what happened. Yeah. Well, good morning, Julie. It's very clear investors are not too happy about this. Amiss on both the top and bottom lines. As you mentioned, profits really suffered as a result of those greater investments in marketing content, international expansion, which Paramount has been really committed to week advertising revenue as well. That declined to 2% in the quarter. That's a big macroeconomic challenge at the industry as a whole has been grappling with that weight on the company's bottom line CEO Bob Backish, though. He focused on the company's subscriber wins for the quarter. We did see a significant amount of growth Paramount plus adding 4.6 million subs for a total of 46 million Pluto TV also seeing continued success with 72 million monthly active users. And as a whole, the company has nearly 67 million subscribers across its direct to consumer services. And executives said that there's more room to run here. The problem, though, that Wall Street seems to have is on the profit side. Can DTC alone save Paramount amid these linear TV challenges? We heard from Wells Fargo Steve K Hall earlier this week. He issued a second downgrade in less than a month on the stock. He suggested that Paramount take on the role of an arms dealer, similar to what we've seen from Sony, maybe license out or sell off some of those assets. Bob Backish was specifically asked about this strategy on the earnings call. But he said that's not really part of their vision. He's really committed to keeping content on the platform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,4,2022-11-02 14:04:45
4611," part of their vision, he's really committed to keeping content on the platform. He says that's ultimately how you deliver value. Backage also confirming that price hikes will be coming. He actually said this on our air during Yahoo finances all market summit. No timeline has been given on that, but that's something to look out for as well. Overall, though, investors really struggling to find that silver lining shares seem to be accelerating their losses a bit down over 9.5%. Allie, while we have you and we're zeroing in on the entertainment landscape, Netflix's ad supported tier that launching now to do we have a sense of where some of the conversations around where the what's actual content will be on that ad tier are starting to net out. Yeah, this is a big point of conversation right now. This ad tier launching officially in the US tomorrow and the company did warn that about 5 to 10% of programming will not be available on this ad tier due to ongoing conversations surrounding the rights to air ads against some of this content. The Wall Street Journal confirming that those talks are still ongoing with several major studios and that includes some big guys are sitting on your screen now Disney NBC Universal Sony Pictures Warner Brothers Discovery Lionsgate. Some of these studios provide original content to Netflix. Others offer reruns, license their content. We're talking about some pretty big shows here, Grey's Anatomy, the Crown, you. So it's very important that Netflix can get this right experts that I've spoken with have said advertising is a future for this company as it competes for subscribers and the revenue that comes along with that. We have Disney's ad tier coming out next month. Many players in this space already. So Netflix really trying to take a bite out of that market share. But in order to do that, you have to have the content of both the user side and the advertising side. So this is something that we will have to watch very closely. It says ad tier rolls out. All right, nobody let Penn bachelor know that he might not be on the ad supported tier. He might get upset. We know what happens then. Thanks so much. Allie Canal. We appreciate it. Switching gears everyone investors saying it's a match as dating app specialist match group reported and earnings beat the company which owns popular services including Tinder, Inge and Match.com saw a boost in users and subscriptions in Tinder. That's just even as a widening or weakening global economy threatens some of the spending here particularly from its lower income consumers. But this is notable especially given how the reopening would certainly thrust a lot of attention towards people who were just looking to get back out and year over year that was the construct how much of the reopening in 2021 in Q3 back then would actually protrude or permeate over into 2022 and remain kind of this normalized level. I guess the only thing I can really add here is this love is not recession proof. I mean really if you if you've lost a job recently you don't have money to go spend $200 on a date night. That's how I read this quarter. Yeah I mean so the company last quarter was not great right in terms of the earnings in particular and so this reminds me oddly of Intel a little bit where right where basically the company comes out and says we're going to be disciplined on headcount. We're going to be disciplined on expenses and that seems to be in this environment what the street wants to hear. These reassurances that these companies are reading the room so to speak and that they understand that we're going into a tricky time. So that seems to be the sort of big picture here of why matches reacting so well to this report. You wouldn't think that Intel and and match would have much in common but there that's the theme I see at least. I'm getting I'm well I don't think Tinder I think there was weakness throughout this report. I think they highlighted that really through it they lost customers in some parts of the business. Well for match for Bumble all of them are trying to build up the amount of revenue that they're seeing on each individual users by offering some of the incremental kind of add-on costs whether that's being able to move yourself to the top of somebody's queue whether that's being able to say you know just send somebody a gift through the platform which to me is a little creepy but if that's your thing that should not do. Yeah I mean the the paying users here is what is going to continue to come down to where they're seeing that that paying user kind of increase and I think it's really going to come back to as well the amount of word of mouth marketing that actually takes place among those paying users because if some paying users",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,5,2022-11-02 14:09:02
4612, user kind of increase and I think it's really going to come back to as well the amount of word of mouth marketing that actually takes place among those paying users because if some paying users are saying you know what at the end of the day this is not really working for me anyway then you could see a deceleration. I mean there's also some internal stuff going on there's no permanent CEO for Tinder right now the CEO of that group left earlier in the year and they have not replaced them and so this is something that they need to work on as well so they're seeing the revenue strength. They're seeing still paying users keep up but it's this sort of preparing for maybe things that are not going to be so rosy going down coming down the pipe. Indeed. All right we're also watching electronic art shares. They're on the move. The video game maker is still confident that consumers will keep gaming despite economic headwinds for more our tech editor Dan Halley joins us. Dan I think a lot of anticipation for electronic arts I'm sure ahead of the world cup they talk a little bit about this on the earnings call last night. Yeah you know they so let's just go over the numbers real quick they had missed on earnings per share and revenue and they had seen net bookings that were 100 1.75 billion that's compared with 1.85 billion in the year ago quarter that is to kind of be expected after this huge explosion that we saw in the gaming industry throughout the pandemic so there's going to be a drop the bigger issue here I think for them is what they're expecting for the full fiscal year and they revised those numbers downward they think that they're going to get between 2.79 and 2.8 billion sorry the expected revenue was supposed to be 7.6 billion to 7.8 billion that's down 50 million from what they had previously said and then total bookings they're expecting between 7.65 and 7.85 billion that's down from the 7.9 and 8.1 billion so they're expecting less spending they're saying that that's you know a mix of things including the currency headwinds as well as people may be pulling back they did yes with the world cup they had their largest launch ever for FIFA as far as FIFA 23 goes they said they had 10.3 million players in its first week which is absolutely huge they also have other franchises that are continuing to play there's apex legends people still like that they did have their latest battlefield title come out which was who boy a absolute stinker I mean it just was not good it was broken right out of the gate and they're trying to fix that you know and you feel bad for the developers to put time into that but I mean that's just not going anywhere and then you know going forward they do have some titles coming out they have it takes 2 coming out for the Nintendo switch that's more of like a you know friendly like my wife and I would play it's not something that's going to really drive sales they have a new D for speed game coming out in December not going to be absolutely massive they have a remake of the game dead space but that's coming in January so you know there's some big games you know then you start going into further into 2023 and you know there's there's more titles there there's a new Star Wars game that tends to do well for them but you know there's nothing that I'm really seeing on their their upcoming games that really just like is going to knock my socks off I think you know their company that they're so heavily heavily reliant on their sports section and look people buy mad in every year and I don't know why I'm just why the stock is up I think the numbers and they weren't that excited the mobile numbers seem to be pretty pretty yeah but the forecats are kind of meh I don't know I think it's that they're the the mobile numbers aren't as bad as they could have been you know competition as far as games this holiday season is going to be kind of light you know the big one coming out is the new God of War game that's a PlayStation exclusive though so it's not you know going to hit on Xbox or anything anytime soon but you know I it probably is having to do it the mobile aspect and then you know it's not as bad as they thought it could be but you know like I said nothing really here that's going to knock my socks off as far as upcoming titles it's just you know Activision Blizzard still has a lot take two still has I mean look Grand Theft Auto 5 is you know 8 million years old and it's still printing money for them so as you were running through the reception of some of those core titles that many of them being household names I was looking at some data that came out yesterday called a duty modern warfare 2 has become the number one selling opening weekend ever in the franchise 800 million dollars through the first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,6,2022-11-02 14:13:27
4613," Selling opening weekend ever in the franchise 800 million dollars through the first Three days from its release on October 28th with that in mind What do we expect of this particular holiday season as we were just breaking down where the consumers might be starting to pull back in some spending categories Is that the same in gaming as well? I think gaming, you know, they're there's always talk about is it you know Obviously everything there's talk about is it recession proof? I think with gaming in particular, you know the titles Maybe less you know at to suffer the you know actual game sales They are 60 bucks, so maybe people won't be buying as often, but there are sales, you know that are just bonkers now You know you wait a month after its title comes out and it goes from 70 bucks to 20 bucks So you know, I mean sure that means that the companies aren't you know doing as well on margin there But it does mean that the sales are going through and then the bigger thing is what they have to offer as far as Online play and then that's where your net bookings come in and that'll start to really blow up for people I think for you know activation Blizzard and call duty That's another title that just prints money for them and they're gonna have their online game That's they have the multiplayer aspect going on, but they're gonna have modern war zone two Which really blew up at the high of the pandemic or at the onset of the pandemic? This is the sequel to that I still play it every Friday again a couple of white claws and I'm gonna keep doing that So I'll be on on there as well, but you know, I think there are some titles They're gonna continue to do well really for for a lot of companies They they look at the online games and they say this is a continuing revenue stream They look at the single player games and they say it's not really gonna do as well But then honestly on balance you can look at some of these single player games and say oh they they blew everyone else out of the water So I'm looking at you know got a war racking rock and thinking that that could be one of those games So link up with me on Xbox damn. I guess I'm gonna be a gem. I can really good Baby I for a good SNES. We're always on fire. That's what we do Yeah, man gaming expert Dan Haley. Okay, before we go to break we're watching shares of Disney off paramounts Really less than expected earnings the queries Tim Nolan is out reiterating an outperform rating on the stock I had a disease November 8th earnings No one thinks Disney plus his place to show continued upside in new subscriber additions and slowing operating losses But he does voice a good bit of caution on the outlet for Disney's theme parks where attendance could be hit in 2023 if the US economy slips into a recession Coming up dollar general face a lawsuit from Ohio Julie's back with that plus a look at more of today's top headlines.

China locking down the area around the world's largest iPhone factory for seven days due to a COVID outbreak. This moved likely to cause further disruptions in operations for Apple supplier Foxconn and then potentially spelling bad news for Apple ahead of the holiday season. Foxconn said in a statement, the plant will continue operating within a quote to close to loop or self-contained bubble that limits contact with the outside world. There were reports remember over the weekend about workers fleeing the factory because of concerns that they would be then stuck there. Chemical maker Dupont, terminating its $5.2 billion file of Rogers Corporation as a result of the company's being unable to obtain timely clearance from all required regulators. Dupont said all parties had received regulatory approvals for the merger except from that of China's state administrator for market regulation. Shares of engineering materials maker Rogers are plunging as this deal is going away. Dupont though is trading higher analyst for positive after this deal got canceled in the statement. Rogers said it is evaluating all options in response to Dupont's notice. And dollar general hit with a lawsuit as Ohio sues the US discount retailer due to several complaints regarding overcharges. These complaints come as testing last month found $20 general stores with significant pricing errors. The lawsuit seeks civil fines of $25,000 per violation, payment of actual damages to consumers, and a permanent injunction against further violations. Suss? Rockwell Automation shares down here after the company saw higher earnings and sales in the fourth quarter and issued a fiscal 2023 growth forecast. Let's bring in Rockwell Automation Chairman and CEO Blake Morett for more on this. Blake, always good to see you. Top of your earnings release. You know that organic sales in the fourth quarter up 20 and a half percent that's very big gain against a backdrop of a slowing economy. Where are those sales coming from? So we saw great sales in the fourth quarter. It was broad based. We serve a wide variety of industrial markets from automotive which had a very good quarter. Semiconductor as we're participating in the build-down of capacity there, oil and gas, renewable energy with solar energy, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, a really broad based across the spectrum. With that kind of broad based results that you have seen, where do you kind of look across the business and really identify where there is perhaps even still cost management that needs to take place at this point in time? Well, productivity is always a part of what we're doing. Even in a time like this when we're seeing double-digit growth, we saw, as you said, double-digit growth in the last fiscal year, particularly strong in the fourth quarter. And as we go forward into our fiscal year, 23 double-digit growth again with strong earnings growth as well. Now, productivity for us and for our customers always remains in style. You know, a big part of our value proposition is increased efficiency in all of these industries as well as helping them launch new lines of business. And we look inward and look for ways to be efficient ourselves. Blake, I'm trying to figure out why your shares are down, frankly. And I don't know if it was the midpoint of the private forecast, maybe being a little light of what analysts were predicting. But I also see your free cash flow was lower than some of the folks on the street were predicting at about $358 million. Can you talk to us about your cash position and how you guys are spending and or saving right now? Sure. We're traditionally a very strong converter of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,8,2022-11-02 14:22:06
4615," cash position and how you guys are spending and or saving right now. Sure, we're traditionally a very strong converter of free cash flow. And one of the things that we see in an environment like this is an increase in our inventory, particularly components work in process. As we're managing through the supply chain constraints, bringing in largely semiconductor chips, they're arriving at different times. And so we're making sure that we're bringing in that inventory so that when that last chip arrives, then we're able to get products out the door and improve the customer service and reduce lead times to customers. The downside of that is that higher inventory is reflected in higher working capital, which has a negative impact on free cash flow. Blake, I mentioned before your organic sales in this four in the fourth quarter, you just completed up 20 and a half percent, but your outlook for the next 12 months, you see organic sales up 9% to 13%. How is this current quarter started? Current quarter has started in line with our expectation. So our quarter began October 1. And so far, the quarter in terms of orders and shipments is developing in line with expectations. I want to also mention, you know, in an environment like this, there's continued volatility while we expect a gradual improvement in the supply chain and specifically around semiconductor availability for the types of node technologies that we use. We still believe a conservative approach is appropriate as we introduce guide for the year. I'm also curious about whether a conservative approach is warranted on things like headcount. I noticed in the statement, you talked about that you're committed to investing in attracting and retaining key talent. How are you thinking about workforce and headcount right now? Are you sort of holding the line on numbers, but still focused on getting the best people in their house that work? Well, we always focus on getting the best people in and obviously making sure that we're an attractive destination for talent in always. In compensation is certainly a part of that. Increase amounts of equity as a part of total rewards and all the other things that make Rockwell a great place to work. And with a continued low unemployment, then we recognize that talent, especially in some of the most high demand jobs, have a lot of choices. And it's a fundamental part of our culture to consider all the other choices that an employee like a customer can go and to make sure that we match up really well. Blake, good to see you. Blake, Marette is Rockwell Automation CEO. Thanks so much. Thank you. Coming up, XPO has officially launched its spin off our XO. We're going to speak to the new CEO of XPO.

Full disclosure you and I chatted a little bit last night at a reception at the NYSE following the formal spin off here and we of course have talked to Brad Jacobs who is now stepping down as the CEO of the company about the rationale behind what's going on but just to take a step back we have talked so much about the broader economic landscape we've talked a lot about the buildup that we've seen in inventories and a lot of industries what are you guys seeing across the country in terms of the flows of goods. Julie it was great seeing you and thanks thanks for having me on so we are seeing a softer macro this year than what we saw last year and we're hearing mixed feedback from our customers today our less than truckload business is two-third industrial companies and we're seeing some of these companies having more product flow through their supply chain so they're ending up shipping more product while other are seeing softer than n and on the retail side it's similar a similar feedback now the said you wouldn't see it in our numbers we delivered a great third quarter but we delivered record EBTA we grew our and in our LTL business we delivered record revenue and record EBTA and we're seeing an acceleration of tonnage where we flipped what we should image of volume where we flipped to positive on a year on year basis in September and we expect to be positive on volume in the fourth quarter as well. Just given this backdrop Mario how are you investing in the business have you pulled back at all. We are planning for our less than truckload business we are continuing to plan to invest more into the business over the last year we pivoted to the next phase of our LTL business we call it LTL 2.0 which is based on capitalizing on the high return on invested capital into our less than truckload business so we're opening up more terminals we're adding more trailers to our fleets we're adding more trucks and we're seeing the success of doing so again we accelerated our tonnage trends at where we buck typical seasonality and we are also bucking industry trends in terms of gaining market share as well. In those tonnage trends is there anything that says to you that there is a spending pullback among some of the most notable consumers that you're carrying for? So today again our business is two-third industrial companies and the call of 2025 percent are e-commerce and or retail type type companies. We are seeing some customers slowing down where the consumer for example is buying less but we are also seeing some retail companies having to turn through inventory to have the right type of product in their supply chain and in that case they are shipping more product. For the industrial companies again a lot of these companies through COVID had pent up demand where now they are being able to get the product they need to fulfill open purchase orders and that's leading to more demand while others are seeing softer demand. So COVID is a very mixed environment and generally the map,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,10,2022-11-02 14:30:53
4617," The product they need to fulfill open purchase orders and that's leading to more demand while others are seeing softer demand. So, quality is a very mixed environment and generally the macro is softer than where it was a year ago or where it was earlier in the year, but using our own company specific initiatives who are being able to go out and gain market share by focusing on delivering great service for the customer and having capacity in our network to gain that business. Mario, what's happening on the trucker front these days? You know, we heard a lot about the trucker shortage that even before the pandemic, right? This was something that was pretty acute in the industry. What's the status and in the industry more broadly and then for XBO specifically? The driver shortage obviously is not new to our industry and it's something that did accelerate through the pandemic. Now things are getting easier where we are now than where we were earlier in the year just to give you an example in the third quarter. We saw an increase in applications per post the direct go up by 58% on a year on year basis. But we there as well we have a company specific initiative that I'm very proud of that helps us counter the driver shortage. We operate our own driver schools out of 130 locations. And this year we are on track to graduate more than 1700 drivers to join our rank. And it's a great career opportunity for people who join our company as dog workers and they can actually become a driver where they can make more wages and have a great career with us over the years to come. Mario, you you're following big footsteps and a big personality and Brad Jacobs. I'm convinced he's off camera there, but you know, maybe he's not. How do you what should investors know about you? Tell us a little bit about your story. You got it. So my background is in technology. I initially, you know, this is where my what education was, went to MIT for for my engineering degrees. And since then I used to be in the tech sector for a while then, but been with XBO for the last 11 years. I was Brad's third hire on the team back in 20, 2011. And we've been part of every decision we've made and I learned a ton of from Brad over over those 11 years. And I look forward now to this next chapter of being CEO and look forward to the next chapter of our company that we're very excited about moving forward. You know, in that extensive kind of work history, where do you think about some of the parallels that we've seen in previous economic downturns and how you intend to lead XBO through what is the impending or anticipated next downturn? Well, we are modeling for different scenarios for next year, depending on if the macro further softens from here or if things do get better as well. Now in our LTL business, it's again, it's a business that has a high mode associated with it, where you haven't had the big competitors go into less than truck load in 30 to 40 years. And that leads to strong pricing dynamics where obviously price is a stays positive in our industry, even in the soft market, we anticipate still having pricing power to our customers. The second area is managing variable cost is that if the macro thus often today 75% of our costs are variable based on the volume that we are moving through our network. So we would anticipate to work both the efficiency angle and using leveraging our technology as well to make sure that we are managing that variable cost to the volume we're seeing in the environment. But again, I would intend to also gain market share and we're looking at typical trends and we're looking industry trends in terms of being able to gain more market share from our customers. Well, good luck this holiday season. Good luck on your CEO journey looking forward to staying in touch. XPO CEO Mario Harret. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks so much. Coming up, MasterCard CEO is weighing in on the recession debate. We'll have our chat with him next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,11,2022-11-02 14:35:09
4618," I really, really think that Yone was the lucky winner. I can believe we did a omega KET21, no one ever Clay–downed in there, we told them that we were failing such before. Now we can work through many ways. And now we are ready to beat virus and start doing these things. We will continue to do this, Mr. Cardocio, Michael Mibak, weighing in on the outlook for consumers with recession fears, swallowing, also telling us about inflation. Take a listen. Well, you're not talking to the economic oracle, so I don't really know what is going to happen in the future. What I can tell you is through the lens of our business and we do see a good chunk of consumer spending and of business spending is that there is inflation in the numbers or prices have gone up. But we also see this as the more interesting story that I think is the consumers continue to spend. There is resilience in consumer spending. It pretty much every part of the world. There is changes though in what people spend on. We just talked about the shift to the services economy. But depending on different segments within the spectrum of consumers, there is more shift to maybe necessities, so less discretionary spend. We spend more on food versus back to travel. That is at different ends of the spectrum. That could be a trend that we're seeing. So the what? Someone changing. The absolute level. Not changing. We see that in Europe. We see it in the United States. We see it really in every part of the world. What do you think that momentum continues in the holidays? You know, again, back to predictions, how to see where it's going to go. So far, we don't see any near term changes in a consumer overall spending levels. The continuation of these shifts into experiences, vis-a-vis goods, I think that will continue. Are you confident in saying that we're just not going to have a recession? You don't see any red flags in your numbers that would give you. We constantly. Currently, based on the data that we have, which is all past, that already happened, there is no such indication. Consumer is resilience. That resilience will last. Last to, you know, we have not any indication that there's a near term recession. So we said, well, certainly we don't see it this year. But who knows? It's too early to talk about 2023. What will MasterCards role be in the future of crypto? Number one earlier, we were saying whatever choices people take in payments. So some people want to invest in crypto assets, for example. So, you know, buy by any cryptocurrency. And we want to make that as easy and more importantly, as safe as any other payment that people affect with MasterCards. So, buy a good, and it's not really living up to what it is. You can basically reverse that. You know, charge back that. That particular payment. And when it comes to crypto, same expectations and aspirations on safety, security, regulatory compliance. So we want to make it easy. And we want to make it safe. And that's how we've been engaging whole set of partnerships with crypto.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,12,2022-11-02 14:39:35
4619," Variations on safety, security, regulatory compliance. So we want to make it easy and we want to make it safe. And that's how we've been engaging whole set of partnerships with crypto exchanges. So I can buy crypto easily through my card and I can pay out from my crypto world using a MasterCard SEND solution with basically a push payment back into my card or wherever it goes. So making that very straightforward, you look at other aspects of the crypto economy. The overall question of where's regulation going, regulatory compliance and things like that. We have a whole set of services that we deploy to make the ecosystem safe. So exchanges, banks and everybody else who wants to play in the space, in the end they all have needs that are pretty common on safety security, so we fulfill those. And finally, there's a lot of talk out there on central bank digital currencies, which is yet another angle of the crypto economy where we advise and work with governments and we provide testing facilities. You want to create the digital sand dollar and the government of the Bahamas has done that and they partner with us to try it out and see how that works. So we cover the whole spectrum of the crypto economy. Really, from the simple starting point, it's an interesting technology. People have interested in that. There's problems to solve. The payment's easing is efficient as it could be everywhere in the world. I have this full interview with Michael now on the Yowel Finance homepage with a nifty 350 where Oracle I wrote off, but also worth noting as well, not in this particular clip. He said already in the buy-out pay later space and he said it pretty matter of fact, which got me wondering, well, what does that mean for a firm in Clarner if it comes like MasterCard is in here and perhaps going to get in here even more? What's that mean for a block? In an after pay who are also looking at more consumers leaning into the ability to pay in different segments for a purchase that they can make today instantly. And where does that even kind of have a bigger type of role in the broader kind of credit annexation that consumers have right now, especially going into the holiday season? Well, and even more broadly beyond buy-out pay later, a lot of the giant legacy financial firms are already fintech, so to speak. They're in a lot of those same businesses, right? Maybe they're not a small animal, maybe they're not as known by the public for doing that. Well, most of them do it, but I don't know what that means for the longer term competitive landscape. But by and large, America expressed MasterCard very good quarters, not just in the US, even overseas, too is well, pretty good. Yeah, absolutely. Guys, coming up, speaking of the holiday holiday travel season is upon us, we're going to speak with the CEO of Travago on the back of that company's earnings report. That's nice.

4620," Anytime Hev Shares of Travago are going on quite the trip today up 16% after seeing revenue in the third quarter rise 33% year over year, but warned that high interest rates and inflation will continue to impact consumer spending. Travago CEO Axel Heather joins us now. So always a pleasure to speak with you on the back of earnings here. Look, let's dive into some of the results here and some of the trends that you're seeing. If there's one catalyst that really sticks out to you from the quarter, what would you pinpoint? I mean, the quarter showed very strong demand as we expected. People want to travel and it's a basic need from our perspective and also what we've seen the pandemic and you've seen that demand was very strong. Prices were strong and that is obviously a good combination for us as we compie our prices. And bring it down for us a little bit, Axel, where you are seeing demand both geographically and in what kind of travel? Yes, so the Western markets were strongest in Asia. It's obviously very, very different market by market, but generally speaking, the recovery has not been as strong as in in Europe and in America's kind of travel. I mean, a bit all over the place, so our top destination worldwide is London, so the big metropolitan attractive cities. But then you've also seen in the US a lot of demand for Orlando, for Anaheim, so for the Disneyland trips, family trips, beaches were very popular. So really, I would say, you have very, very broad demand and all the trips that you couldn't do during the pandemic. People wanted to do now. Axel, Brian Chesky, over at Airbnb, talked a lot about on his earnings call last night, a little bit of a slowdown in the holiday quarter. You seeing that? No, I mean, the third quarter was very strong for us. I mean, what we are seeing right now that there are first signs of a change in consumer behavior, which is exactly what you would expect. I mean, the inflation is hitting consumers pretty much everywhere in the Western world. And what we expect for next year, and we see early signs of that, are basically three things. One is that people are reducing their length of stay, so trying to save some money by by staying for one day less. And there we see some early signs in Europe in particular. You do expect people to actually go to different destinations where either transportation is cheaper or the destination overall is cheaper. And again, we start to see that, in particular, in Europe, for example, Morocco is becoming more popular, which is a very attractive destination, but usually not on top of everybody's list. And the last thing is that you expect people to obviously compare prices more if things are getting more expensive. And that's exactly what we do. And we also see they are an increase in activity. One of the types of stays that you're seeing people lean into, especially as they are comparing prices. And where potentially are they beginning to push back on some of those prices? Yeah, I mean, the types of trips, the top destinations are actually still very similar, as I said, I mean, London worldwide in the US, New York is actually on top of the list. And we do see that people start...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,14,2022-11-02 14:48:12
4621," Okay, it's actually on top of the list. But we do see that people start to move away from the top and most expensive destinations to more secondary destinations to still have a good break and then to take some time off without sacrificing on the experience but saving some money. Axel, we're trying to just tie a lot of pieces or pieces of economic puzzle together. So we had SDL order our earnings this morning noting a slowdown in travel retail and specifically called out Asia. What are you seeing in your business in terms of international travels to the US and then also in Asia specifically? Yeah, Asia is very difficult to comment on because the situation in Asia is very different market by market. I mean, generally speaking, we see some recovery but very different. Japan, for example, we've seen a strong and strong increase in Q3, but it's difficult to comment in general. Overall, the US is obviously in a specific situation given the strength of the dollar. So traveling from the US to Europe in particular got a lot cheaper. So we see a lot more demand from US travelers for the top and most attractive European cities like London, Paris, Rome, etc. The other way round, obviously got a lot more expensive and you can also see that. We've had some CEOs classify this as the golden age of travel that coming from the Hilton CEO. While we heard from Airbnb last night that for cross-border travel, the return would be choppy moving forward from here. From your purview, is it more choppy than it is? Kind of golden at this point in time, especially looking across some of the international destinations that you were just mentioning a moment ago? I mean, it's difficult to say to be honest. I think my view is somewhere in the middle. It's, I do think that people will continue to travel and I do think that the spending for traveling next year will be up from this year. On the other hand, I also do expect travelers to cut back on the nights that they stay in hotels to save some money and to compensate for the inflation that you have on travel costs. So you're not a bad market. I mean, the market will be up next year, but not a golden market either. Not a bad move in the stock price here today in reaction to earnings here. We've seen them moving higher and holding on to some sharp games as the rest of the market is waiting for the Fed. We're appreciative of the time, as always, Travago, CEO, Axel Heifer, Axel, thanks so much. Guys, coming up, we're gonna do a deep dive into some more earnings reports. We've got young brands, Canada Goose, and Tupperware brands, Royce, coming up next. Stop. V",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,15,2022-11-02 14:52:58
4622,"ünf It is time for Cut for Time. You hear the song, you know it. Today we focus on three earnings, one minute each. Let's put a minute on the clock for shares of young brands following the third quarter earnings report that saw the company miss on profits but beat on revenue estimates as same-store sales increased 5% worldwide. We did see a net change lower to the downside and operating income there and significantly so you're over a decline of about 62.7%. My answer is I really want to lock in on this talk about results. Same-store sales up 6% recessions are made for talk about but I have to call out pizza hood. Same-store sales 1%. This just continues to be a persistent problem for this company. They need to fix it unclear what the solution would be to get those sales back up a pizza but they have a key investor day in December so they perhaps may share it a little more of a stretch. KFC was the big outperformer here. I'm 7% comps. I will say pizza hot while it was only up 1% beat estimates and Taco Bell missed estimates even though it was up 6%. Oh, big question. Correct myself. In all of the different tabs I have open I was actually looking at the long-run earnings report. They're operating profit, gap basis grew 4% and then the core operating profit of 80% there. So I was giving actually a deep tease to our next company. Can I get a goose? All right. So I have a goose while they're down I'm told after the cold weather apparel posted an earnings beat for the second quarter but slashed Q3 in full your guidance as they expect COVID-19 restriction in China to continue negatively impacting performance. Not a bad quarter for Katna Goose just going through it I think really took me back to when I talked to Daniel Rees over at the Goldman conference a couple of weeks ago. The man seems to be good. China appears to be the weak point though. Also inventory no big builds there. Not a hugely big red flag but I mean it's quite a lot. I don't know this is not what you want to hear from the CFO. Jonathan Sinclair telling analysts it is extremely challenging to project the bulk of the years trading based on merely a few weeks of visibility but recent events impacting trends are not supportive of our original outlook. Not supportive of our original outlook that's not what you want to hear. I mean far less people are going to have the money at least to spend and because Canada Goose had been trying to get more into kind of the average consumer even though it's a very pricey product. The affluent consumer continues to kind of attract towards that but there are new kind of trendier fashion jackets, coats, outerwear that is taking on more of that market share that Canada Goose once held on to strongly. However I will say I've never been so confident turning a corner in New York City during a winter. I love my country. I love my country. I love my country. How confident are you when you put your food, your leftovers in a container? Oh, it's a good one. It's a good one. No, that was a bad trend. Wow. Share some tap-aware brands are plunging. They are off by 43% today. Big earnings miss for TUP on both the top and bottom lines. The company reporting a 20% drop in sales compared with last year here and just getting destroyed in terms of the shares here. It's pretty amazing. The company says it's going to take additional restructuring actions in the fourth quarter as well as implementing stringent inventory reduction programs. Yeah, I bet. Yeah. Look, we just heard a couple of weeks ago we got a warning from New L brands too as well. So perhaps this shouldn't have come as a shocker. Really, I would say shame on TUP-worthy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,16,2022-11-02 14:56:56
4623," I bet. Yeah, and look, we just heard a couple weeks ago, we got a warning from New L brands too as well, so perhaps this shouldn't have come as a shocker. But really, I would say shame on Tupperware. They came out a couple weeks ago and really I think hyped up this new development where they're going to sell products outside of their Tupperware infrastructure into Target and the stock reacted favorably. But now they're coming out here a couple weeks later and really just reporting a really, really ugly quarter. Right, and that's the expansion of the Tupperware ecosystem that they were talking about in this earnings release. But the company is going to continue to really kind of move forward with this turnaround plan, but the investors are upset that the turnaround plan is not paying dividends as quickly as they would have hoped. My mom used to sell Tupperware. I know she's watching. I remember you sold Tupperware mom. I mean, how much plastic crap do we have in her houses? Like how much more do you need? So, I don't know. She hasn't sold any more just to be clear. She hasn't sold Tupperware. I've also ordered, okay. I don't know. No, I didn't think I was insulting your brother. I hoped I wasn't insulting your brother. I've also ordered enough from caviar and door dash at this point that I just kind of keep the containers. You keep the containers? Of course, you don't need to buy anything. Let's take a look at markets before we leave you here as we are still waiting for the Fed. Can't forget about that. We still have a little bit of a down draft in markets here with the Nasek leading to Clyde's off a half a percent.

4624," It's just three hours away. Expectations are for a 75 basis point hike. Investors are going to be parsing and dissecting every line and that it would be from Chairman Jay Powell's presser. All the divine clues as to the future of U.S. monetary policy. And it is an earnings parade on Wall Street as investors digesting earnings from Estee Lauder, Young Brands, Paramount, and Airbnb. We're going to break down the numbers and stop movements for you. And finally, luxury profits. The CEO of Bentley Motors tells us what drove profits to record highs this year. Prosubermanian joins us for the interview. But first, we want to take a look at where stocks are trading right now. It's a down day on Wall Street. Dow is down about 83 basis points. The S&P 500 of the Nasdaq, each off about half a percent. And taking a look at the bond market, the yield curve has shifted lower. And this is all on the heels of that big Fed decision that we are expecting later today. And for that, we want to stick with this and bring in Yahoo Finance as Jennifer Schonberger, who's standing on the scene over at the Fed in DC. Can't wait. What is on deck today, Jennifer? Good morning, Jared. Fed officials meeting right now in this building behind me discussing the economy, discussing inflation. They are widely expected to raise short term rates by another three quarters of a percentage point when they conclude their policy meeting this afternoon at 2 p.m. That would bring the Fed funds rate up to a range of 3.75% to 4% up from the current range of 3 to 3.75% to 3.75%. That would mark the fourth straight 75 basis point rate hike since June. An unprecedented move by the Federal Reserve since it started explicitly targeting the Fed funds rate back in the late 1980s. But it will be what Fed Chair Pell says during his press conference on the pace of forthcoming rate hikes that markets will be most attuned to. Investors expect that the Fed will signal that it will slow down the pace of forthcoming rate hikes starting in its December meeting. A few Fed officials have talked about the notion of stepping down the pace of rate hikes. The Fed wants to tame inflation while also towing the line between not crashing the economy and taking into account that monetary policy filters through the economy with a lag. So while the Fed may taper the pace and open question remains how much higher they could raise race and whether they stick with their current forecast. If inflation remains sticky, right now the Fed expects to raise to 4.6% on average next year. Of course, all of this contingent on forthcoming data, specifically inflation, we will get more from Fed Chair Pell during his press conference at 2.30 this afternoon. Jared. And Jennifer, that's what I want to focus on because all the traders, both humans and artificial intelligence high frequency trading algorithms, going to focus on Powell's tone there and how that's conveyed. Because we know with Jackson Hole, he was very short-brief saying, we're going to hike until this breaks or something along those lines. And then it seems like some dovish expectations have creeped back into the market with some talk about standing down. So what are traders expecting here? Yeah, Jared. I think that Chair Powell is going to have to toe the line as I just mentioned. He's still going to have to talk tough on inflation because it is still sticky. If you look at the core inflation rates, whether it's CPI or PCE, the Fed's preferred measure. But he's going to have to talk tough on inflation while also saying that they're going to take into account that they're not going to crash this economy. Now he has said that pain is going to be involved here. So maybe the question is, do they accept a shallow recession? And is that why they may be signaling that it's time to start soon stepping down the pace of rate hikes? In other words, you step down the pace. You ease the pressure on the economy. But maybe that also means the Fed funds rate has to go higher eventually if inflation remains sticky. Yeah, we're going to sort it all out in a few hours. And we know you're going to be standing by for that. Thank you, Vialcul Finance. This is Jennifer Seanberger. And now we're going to take a look at the broader markets and investors as we await the Fed's rate decision. And for that, we have Portia Capital Management owner, Michelle Connell here. And Michelle, great to see you here today. Let me just get your overview of what you're expecting in terms of fireworks or maybe no fireworks in a few hours. Jared, I'm probably in the same cap as everyone else. And I'm going to reiterate what general.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,18,2022-11-02 15:05:36
4625," in terms of fireworks or maybe no fireworks in a few hours. Jared, I'm probably in the same cap as everyone else and I'm gonna reiterate what Jennifer just said. I think the Fed comes out with a 75 point rate hike and the remain conservative going forward and they keep a stern tone towards inflation. But that being said, we're seeing some areas of weakness in some pricing, shipping, imports that are used by consumers and producers. So I think maybe soon versus later, they'll kind of slow down the pace of increases. Well, and then let me ask for your market reaction here. We have seasonality, the best six months of the year, historically speaking, are among, is upon us here, starting with November, the end of October there. That is well understood in the markets, but more than that, there are a lot of videos and credit factors going on. What sectors in terms of equities do you like? What broad movements would you expect in terms of risk metrics going forward? Well, I think because we're at the midterm election cycle and I'm gonna couple that with what you just said about where we are in the cycle. In a midterm election afterwards, between November, the end of November and April, you typically see an upswing in the market or an increase of about 14%. That being said, maybe that doesn't happen. But what gives me some solace here is that even though the last month was pretty strong for the S&P and for the Russell, we still have 50% of the publicly traded stocks that are down 50% year to date. So this is becoming a stock picker's market. Well, and let me ask you about some of the sectors you may like, tech really has taken it on the nose. I mean, most things besides energy are down considerably, but especially tech, anything in there or any other sectors you're liking right now. I still like the chip sector. I started off as a semi conductor analyst back in the day was a little bit early on that, but you're still seeing strong demand for an Nvidia and I think AMD posted strong earnings. I like the data centers and storage and I also think Tesla has a chance in going back to the storage area. I think snowflake looks interesting. All three stocks that I named are down 50% year to date, but I'm not just looking at technology. There's still some good names in energy, even though energy's been the best performing sector. Shell looks really interesting. They had great earnings. They're trading at a deep discount versus their peers about 50% strong dividend. I like some of the industrials. Dear, I look at that kind of as a technology innovation play because they're so strong on their software and being able to maximize the acreage that are used and that also plays a strong dividend. So it's not just one sector, but it's finding those pockets at each sector that still look attractive, you know, in terms of their pricing and potentially their income potential. All right, we're gonna have to leave it there. We're gonna find out a bunch more on this topic in a few hours in the meantime. Thank you, Michelle Connell, Porsche Capital Management owner. And now time for, thank you. And now time for our trending ticker of the day. Canada Goose, providing warmth, has winter descends on the Northern Hemisphere and sending the stock a tad lower today. You can see down about 5%, but rebounding off the lows of the year. And that says the Coatmaker beat on revenue, raking in $277 million Canadian dollars in the second quarter. It also beat on expectations on non-IFRS-adjusted earnings for share of $0.22 Canadian cents versus estimates of only six cents. But focus on COVID disruptions in China's luxury market. They are obscuring the outlook for global macroeconomics and they led the company to lower its fiscal 2023 outlook. On this no Bloomberg intelligence is opining that the slow China reopening is already dragging early on in quarter three. Coming up, shares of meta and SNAP have been pummeled this year. Twitter now in the hands of Elon Musk, and it begs the question, is social media as we know it? Is it over? We're going to discuss next.

4626," The media as we know it is it over. We're going to discuss next. Welcome back and let's take a look at some key earnings from beauty and food and entertainment. Companies, many of these brands, seeing a shift in their earnings due to international headwinds now from lockdowns in China to Russia's war in Ukraine. Joining us now is Yahoo! What are the details in this latest earnings spree? Well Jared, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve today but we are still in the throes of earnings season with a lot of headliners this morning. One of them is SD louder, shares were down about 6% at last glance after the company indicated that it wouldn't see a return to growth until 2023. SD louder, slashed, it's full year forecast, blaming lockdowns in China and also saying that some retailers are taking its cosmetics and perfumes off of their shelves amid worries of an economic slowdown. Notable also that this announcement comes ahead of a crucial earnings, a crucial holiday season for them. The company now expects net sales for 2023 to decrease to 6% to 8% compared to its prior forecast of growth of 3 to 5%. And like its peers in the consumer discretionary sector such as Nike and Levi's, it's also citing currency headwinds as a stronger dollar eats into its international profits. Now makeup demand might be slowing down but people are still lining up to KFC and Taco Bell, young brands, missed estimates on earnings per share, also citing currency headwinds and a loss in profits from its KFC exit from Russia. But it did report rising sales across its fast food chains, even as fast food restaurants are raising prices to keep up with rising commodity and labor costs, people are still flocking to them, opting for more value oriented options.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,20,2022-11-02 15:14:17
4627," Fast food restaurants are raising prices to keep up with rising commodity and labor costs. People are still flocking to them, opting for more value-oriented options. We saw that with McDonald's last week as they shy away from more expensive, dine-out options amid inflation. And finally, Paramount Global is also a mover today. Shares were down as much as 10 percent this morning after the company missed Wall Street estimates on 3rd quarter earnings, Paramount's profit hit was the result of larger investments in content to boost its business. While weakness in advertising revenue also weighed on the quarter, the company did cite growth in its global streaming services, but that wasn't enough to a P's Wall Street. Interesting, makes the company's there and I've got to tell you I can testify to those higher makeup prices, but I still got to be a buyer. So thank you for that report, Alex Submanova. All right, moving on to Elon Musk, making big changes at Twitter saying the service will begin charging for the blue check marks indicated as users are verified. But as social media companies overall grapple with changing demographics, can stalwarts like Twitter and Meta keep up? And here with more is Yahoo Fanat's Dan Howley. So the latest in this saga, Twitter plus, can we think of it that way? Yeah, I mean, look, so my basic takeaway from everything that's happening with social media right now is that this is kind of a changing of the guard where we had seen for so long Facebook and Twitter be the mainstays, the stalwarts. But now this is kind of changing over to what we have with TikTok, what we have with up and comers like Be Real and the reason being is it doesn't seem like Meta really cares about social media anymore. At least as far as Mark Zuckerberg is concerned, now investors certainly still care. They want him to stop with the Metaverse, but he continues to dump $10 billion a year into the effort. And then so far this year, we have a little less than $10 billion to this point. And then they said that in 2023, they're going to see spending on it increase a huge amount. So this is something that they're going to continue to focus on as the future of the company. Twitter, we don't know what's going on. You know, Elon Musk has had the lead with Stephen King to talk about what they should charge for the checkmarks to be verified. So there's still so much up in the air. And it feels like this is a moment where social media is going from what it was to what it will be. And these new companies TikTok AI driven AI powered feed that gets people addicted and look, I deleted it again. Just because you sit there and you're scrolling and scrolling and scroll, then you have Be Real, which is really trying to make social media feel less manufactured, though, any time a pop-up comes that says, be real, you know, and tells you when to start posting. A lot of people still, you know, stage what they were doing or try to make it look a little bit better. Nobody wants pictures of people sitting in the bathroom, which is most of the time on social media. And I think, you know, the other issue that we're seeing is that kids don't care about the main Facebook app. While that still has billions of users, we have a few poll earlier this year said just 32% of teens say that they use Facebook. Meanwhile, we have something like 70% say they use TikTok, 70% plus. So there's these huge swings. And, you know, obviously we could talk about meta performance so far, year-to-date, the shares are down 72%. So what I want to ask you, it's related to meta and the turn, but not turn around strategy. I guess it could be considered a turn around strategy. If you're looking at the stock there on your screen down 72%. Year-to-date. What if Mark is right? What if Zuckerberg is right? This is what I asked myself late at night, not always, but sometimes, you know, in terms of the metaverse, he's pulling $10 billion a year into this project that a lot of people, including a lot of people who work for him, who voted for their feet, don't believe in. Could this be the future of social media? It's interesting, right? Because so many companies are putting money into the metaverse, right? In one way or the other. Now, in my thinking, a company like Nvidia is doing it really well where they're making these ideas of digital twins and they're trying to make it so that when companies build out factories or try to build out infrastructure, they have a kind of virtual version of the world that they can go and manipulate. And so they're not going to spend as much time trying to build out these different kinds of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,21,2022-11-02 15:18:34
4628," infrastructure, they have a kind of virtual version of the world that they can go and manipulate. And so they're not going to spend as much time trying to build out these different kinds of infrastructure, right? So that, I think, is the smarter take. This is, for Meta so far, banking on people, strapping headsets to their face. I don't see people doing that. And the numbers don't bear out. The Wall Street Journal did a piece where they said that Meta had wanted at least 500,000 people in their Horizon World's app by the end of this year. And so far, they had to revise that number to 280,000 because only 200,000 are in there. So it's not like people are clamoring to get on board. They also just launched their new headset. It's what, $1,500 or something along those lines. People can't buy it. It's not something that I think is going to take off in that sense. Now, there's different definitions of the Metaverse. It's not just walking around with goofy, real goggles. There's also the idea that, well, I'm on my computer and I'm interacting with something. So maybe that's the Metaverse. And there's all sorts of discussions of that. Maybe heads up display on your car. That's the Metaverse. So I think that there is still room for it. I don't know though if it's going to be the next social media splash. I think something like TikTok, something along those lines will continue to do well. I just don't think people want to strap something to their face. I don't. Yeah, it's going to have to be some kind of improvement in technology. Maybe that we can't even comprehend yet. But the infrastructure, as we talk about, much like crypto being built right now, and I need to find different things to worry about late at night. Thank you for joining us here with that report, Dan Holley. Coming up, Airbnb shares falling, despite reporting its quote, biggest and most profitable quarter ever. We're going to tell you why next. Welcome back in some breaking news and sports, the Washington Commander.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,22,2022-11-02 15:23:05
4629," Welcome back in some breaking news in sports. The Washington commanders owners, Dan and Tynas Niter announcing that they have hired Bank of America's securities to consider potential transactions. This comes as Dan himself has faced increased pressure to sell the team statement from the commanders said they remain committed to putting the best product in field and continuing the work that to set the gold standard for workplaces in the NFL. We're going to continue to monitor this and bring you developments as they come in. And now luxury British carmaker Bentley announcing record operating profits for the first nine months of 2022. Part of the reason increased customization, Yahoo Finance, Autos reporter, senior auto correspondent, Prada Supermanian is here to tell us all about this. Now we know Bentley's are made by hand at least they used to in terms of my knowledge of it. Still they got that level of attention in detail? Yes, still they've sort of industrialized that process here. So you know strong years so far for Bentley and not surprising from what we're seeing from luxury brands. So the first three quarters of the year, Bentley's operating profit more than double like he said you're out to record high compared to last year but get this. They've only sold three percent more cars. So Bentley Motor CEO Adrian Hallmark says it's all about customers paying up for more goodies. I've been in this industry and in this sector for nearly 28 years. I've never seen spending patterns like it and not just in Bentley, I mean generally. I use an analogy with the way in earlier. If you walk down the line of our production facility even three, four years ago, you'd see line upon line of gray, black, dark blue, dark green cars and the occasional red one. And it was like a dark, somber, conservative place. If you walk through now, it's like a circus. The color, the diversity of what people are ordering, exterior and interior is just fundamentally changed. So there's more customers out there and they're way more interested now in self expression and in personalization. And the second thing is what we've done with the product range. So the product range is the strongest it's ever been and it's good compared with competition. But then also we have consciously, as we say, industrialized complexity. Rather than bringing the number of variables down, we've looked at and said, right, we know if we can do more for customers, they invest more in the product and we make more money. Hallmark says they don't make more money from more horsepower out of more stitching, more leather and more wood. I asked Hallmark what the luxury buy and why they seem so insatiable right now. And he said part of it is because the company's research finds that the number of high network individuals has been growing over the past 20 years to the point that there's four times as many compared to 20 years ago. Ice inflation prize, I guess there's a little bit more to it than that. But let me ask you about their EV plans. We've seen all the big manufacturers take the leap and sometimes with great results, sometimes something else. What's the Bentley case? So, Bentley, just like everyone else, they want to go full EV by 2030. They're going to, that's their goal for right now. Their first EV comes out in 2025 and asks them about that. How's that going to compare to the Rolls Royce Spectre which we saw come out a few weeks back. There's a fascinating car, they like it, but they say ours is going to be more of a grand touring car, a daily driver because they find most of their buyers actually drive their cars every day. So, they want more range, things like that. But also, how much services they want, the charging kind of experience to be a luxury sort of experience. So, they're going to have their own sort of, probably bespoke network of chargers who knows or working through other existing companies. But my understanding is that they want it to be a concierge, it wants a luxury type of service. So, you just mentioned charging and I know that there's no agreed on universal standard right now. How is that evolving in the U.S. especially as all these goals have been brought to the forefront? 2030, 3540? What does the infrastructure look like in terms of EV charging stations? I think as of right now, I think everyone agreed that there's just too few chargers out there in the public space. So, we're seeing a lot more investment from the government here, right? That's $7.5 billion meant to build out, and not only a super highway of charge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,23,2022-11-02 15:27:12
4630," out there in the public space, right? So we're seeing a lot more investment from the government here, right? That's $7.5 billion meant to build out and not only a super highway of chargers, but also just in local areas whether you don't have that many, maybe some suburban or rural areas. So we're seeing that happen. I think the big prom Jared is with the public companies, like the charge points of the world, the EV goes, is so expensive to build these chargers. And there's still not enough, I guess, critical mass of the users, just quite yet. And we will get there someday though. In the meantime, thank you for that report. Praz Supermanian. And taking a look at Airbnb shares trading down about 10% having the worst day since May, that's after posting them better than expected, third quarter earnings, however, the disappointing guidance is causing shares to sell off today. And joining me now is Bernie McTiernan, managing director at Needham and company. I was taking a look, I was breaking the numbers last night and saw that Ford guidance. Should the stock be down more? I even think this reaction is overdoing it to be honest. We're still seeing strong demand trends. Nights both tore up 25% and in the third quarter, we have that decelerating slightly in the fourth quarter of itself a healthy 23 and a half percent. And then ADRs, that's the big question. That's the big focus of the bears right now. They're up 12% year over year in a constant currency basis. We have that decelerating to 7% growth in 4Q. And then on the expectation that we're going to be past peak travel in 23, we actually have them declining 4% next year. But that's really the debate here is that when the macro was going to force Airbnb kind of off the edge of the cliff of this peak travel and ADRs and then the implication of margins is the key focus for the bears. And let me ask you about the Nights and Experiences. That number, especially the forecast, disappointed how critical is Nights and Experiences to the Airbnb model right now? Well, it's the whole flywheel. And so the more people that are booking the more demand that's in the system, that's going to drive ADRs higher. That pricing lever is what flows through the higher margins. And what's really interesting is that it's really a tale of two companies where before the pandemic, things like cross-border travel and urban, where they're really the major use cases for Airbnb. And those are growing really strongly. Urban was up 48% cross-border travel. It was up 27% during the quarter. But there's also these new use cases now that are forming whether it's more rural stays, whether it's long-term stays, long-term stays are still 20% of the bookings on the platform. So proving that it wasn't just a pandemic phenomenon and people really are changing. And going on that point in terms of travel is changing. If you rewind the clock a week or two ago when United Airlines reported earnings, their CEO was channeling his Brian, his inner Brian Chesky and talking about how they thought every weekend now is a three-day weekend and just the potential for them. So not only are they benefiting from business travel coming back with how consumer travel is changing. And Airbnb is certainly benefiting from those trends and consumer travel that Brian's been talking about really since the start of the pandemic. And let me talk to you about Brian. Now, you can talk to us, Bernie, because I remember we were interviewing Brian Chesky early on in the pandemic. They made a huge, huge pivot, which was a correct bet at the time. And I was impressed by the speed at which they pivoted. Some people wish the Fed could be as quick about these things, but I'm just wondering, are things changing now? Is there going to be another switch that Airbnb may able to take hold of and maybe leave its competitors behind a bit? Yeah, it's a good question. So when we, so supply, for example, supply on the platform accelerated this past quarter from mid to high single digit growth and second quarter up to 15% in the third quarter. Our channel check show that verbo supply actually declined in October. So I think that part of the reason is like they want you to be listing on Airbnb. They've been doing trying to innovate a lot on things like air cover, which is a reason why hosted want to be with Airbnb, but also maybe why guests want to be Airbnb too. And that's the power of the platform. When we talk about this marketplace with 30% plus EBITDA margins, the reason why they're able to generate such a EBITDA margins, because they don't need pay for traffic. And still 90%",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,24,2022-11-02 15:31:37
4631," or the platform, when we talk about this marketplace with 30% plus EBITDA margins, the reason why they're able to generate a try EBITDA margins, because they don't need pay for traffic. And still 90% of their traffic is coming to their platform organically. And they're letting that flow through to the bottom line free cash level conversion from revenue over the last 12 months is 41%. They bought back a billion dollars of shares. They have over nine billion dollars of cash. So the investments that they made during the pandemic are really pivots that they may, especially on the cost structure. And that they haven't changed that cost structure that were in a peak travel environment should enable them to weather, you know, a downturn. Obviously, you know, I think bears are playing for that ADR moderation that I spoke about, you know, being minus 4% next year that we have in our malls, they probably have more than that. But the company was confident that they should be able to weather any ADR deterioration, at least modern ADR deterioration from a from a margin standpoint. And that just, and they have the financial flexibility certainly to weather that kind of storm. Well, we have to leave it there at nine billion dollars in cash and enviable position for a number of companies. Thank you, Bernie. Make turn in of need them and company coming up.

That is down over 1% and checking on the sector action today. Utilities in the lead that is up less than half a percent. Industrials and financials also in the green just slightly.

Now, imagine yourself enjoying a nice espresso or espresso martini at a bustling boutique hotel without the actual hotel. Now, that's the concept freehold hospitality is going for. And joining me now is a company CEO and co-founder, Bryce Jones, along with Yahoo Finance, is Brook, De Palma, as well. Now, Bryce, we are talking about your business model during the break. Just give us an overview of what you're bringing to the market here. Oh, well, thank you for having me. We're bringing in the market, a work-by-day play-by-night concept. And we're open from 8 AM to 3 AM at any given venue, serving coffee to cocktails all hours of the day. And now, essentially, you have a location freehold Brooklyn, you have freehold Miami. You rent all your locations. And according to a new survey from Alina Bull, they said about 37% of small businesses across the US were actually unable to rent in full in October. So how are you facing the inflation that's hitting rental prices? And when you look at expansion plans, how is that impacting that as well? I mean, for us, you always have to adapt to whatever it is, whether it be rising costs of goods sold, payroll costs, or just the ability to find staff. And recent rent hikes, you just have to find a way. And we do that through volume, specifically, when everybody else might be cutting. We're trying to invest more into programming and events, whether it be the DJ or the barista walking through your coffee in the morning and so forth. I got to ask you about Miami. I am a native, spent a considerable time there growing up. I'm just wondering, I haven't been down there since the pandemic. I know this scene has changed tremendously. I'm just wondering what it looks like in terms of operating your business down there. I mean, it's bustling. The tourism's very, very high right now. For us, we definitely chose that market as we thought it was pretty much the best growth market in the states right now. It's held completely through the rising cost of inflation and so forth as well. And also in Miami, you have cryptocurrency available to pay if your customers, what sort of interaction have you seen with that? Is it successful there? Are you looking to bring it in Brooklyn as well? I like to compare it to years ago, you have a customer come in with an American Express Black card. And for us, you don't see that card all the time. And it's similar to crypto. You don't see it all the time, but it's special when it happens. It's happening more and more frequently in Miami specifically. And I'm sure the bartenders are always excited to accept it. I know the bartenders always love to see those black cars whipped out here in New York. So I was also asking you over the break, you have private clubs such as Seoul House. You're at a different genre here. You also have that lived work situation. And you are open to the public, whereas that is a private club. So how does that difference in business model work for you? I think volume, so House is a curated group that is very specific to the entertainment industry. And for us, we're trying to appeal to a variety of different demographics, whether it be the tech community, whether it be music and entertainment, and fashion. And for us, that element really brings a very diverse group that packs the place every night. I didn't hear finance in there. No finance, bros. We love finance. OK, then. Just to go back to inflation here, we've seen higher prices across the board. Certainly, when customers are going to get groceries in the store, but also seeing less of an increase at food away from home, have you taken any higher menu prices? And also, how is that sort of taking a toll on your customers? I think our industry is a bit tougher to raise prices. If we raise the price of a latte to what it should be, which would be about $7 of be outcry, for us, we really try to invest in the volume and try to bring. When everybody else is making it smaller or raising prices, we try to actually expand our programming and our events. Well, let me ask you continuing along the discussion of prices, labor, a huge input cost. I know I've talked to several people in the hospitality field, and the turnover is a killer. It's been a challenge for a lot of business owners to retain, and it just get people in the door to work the service bars and the floor and whatever. How are you dealing with these labor challenges? I mean, to give you an example, New York raised minimum wage four times in four years. So labor has always been an issue for our industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,28,2022-11-02 15:49:05
4635," the floor and whatever, how are you dealing with these labor challenges? I mean, to give you an example, New York raised minimum wage four times in four years. So labor has always been an issue for our industry specifically in New York. And for us, the new market is getting people into the door. But I got to tell you that's actually been almost a benefit of inflation in some ways. That people actually need their jobs, they want their jobs, they're here to work, and they're excited to come to work and learn more about the business every day. And we haven't really seen that for the last few years. And it's been sort of a recovery effort by all New York City hospitalities. Really get back after the pandemic. You sit on the board of the New York Hospitality Alliance here. What exactly are you hearing from fellow restaurant owners, fellow small business owners as well, these boutique hotels? Would you say that we have fully recovered from the pandemic? I think we had an amazing 2021. I think we are cautiously optimistic about 2022 and beyond. I think the industry is going in a very positive place despite rising costs. And I think as far as turnout and guest appreciation, we're seeing a ton of success there. And finally to round out the discussion, expansion plans, you're going internationally and Tarksica, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, expansion plans. We're very much eager and willing and looking into it. We have our eyes on a couple of things, but I can't really see anything at this time. All right, sounds- We continue to- Freehold Hospitality CEO and co-founder Bryce Jones and Yahoo Finance's Brooke DuPolma. Coming up even with mortgage rates above 7% it still may make sense for some homeowners to refinance. We're going to tell you who those people are next. Welcome back with mortgage rates at their highest levels in 20 years. Does it make sense for homeowners to refinance?

4636," Back with mortgage rates at their highest levels in 20 years. Does it make sense for homeowners to refinance? Now some experts think it might and joining me now to discuss is Yahoo! Finances, Danny Romero, and Danny, when I saw this, I was thinking, wow, that the math may not work out for most people, but maybe some here. Yeah, so there are a few reasons why someone would benefit from refinancing the first. Is someone who's struggling with their finances. So people who want to consolidate their debt by using their mortgage rate as a way to overall lower their overall debt costs. Secondly, would be someone who's seeking cash, who wants to use the cash out refinance option, meaning which it allows them to access equity that they've built on their home. And lastly, someone who would benefit from refinancing is someone who's dealing with the end of their fixed rate term on their adjustable rate mortgage. So that means that if they locked in at that 7.8, 7.08 percent mortgage rate, that means that their monthly payments later on in the future they won't increase. So those are a few reasons why someone would benefit from refinancing, especially under this current environment. And Black Knight came out with data that says that there are about 133,000 homeowners that are eligible to lower their monthly payments by $325. By lowering their rate to 7.08 percent and that population of homeowners got their mortgage in 2008 or before. Now, having said all that, I want to talk about the lending side. Volumes are down. We know that prices are sticky. People might be bulking and saying, oh, I can't afford that house. What's happening with the lending side right now? Yeah, Jared, you said it left and right. We've heard from different mortgage companies that they are scaling back. They're also laying off their employees due to the lack in demand for mortgages. I mean, data shows us that applications for mortgages is down 86 percent this year. But compared to last year, excuse me, also revenue is down for a lot of these mortgage companies as higher interest rates become really costly for them. And there's even been some lenders who deal with riskier loans that have said, sayonara, I'm no longer going to operate any more. So yes, it is a really grim picture for the lending side. But I spoke with a loan manager who says she's very optimistic, even though they are facing these, these headwinds especially. But she said that she's really betting that interest rates mortgage rates will turn around. Danny, we got another minute or two here. You talk to a lot of people. You got boots on the ground. You go around interviewing people, talk to small business owners. What are they saying? What does it have to be with respect necessarily lending? It can be about particularly peculiarities of their business. But what's the tone on the street in terms of some of the business owners that you're talking to? Some of them that I've just spoken to, inflation. I mean, that word gets thrown around. It's something that they're constantly dealing with. Also employment. I mean, we just saw those numbers just yesterday from the Joltz, I mean, reports. So we're really seeing that they are dealing with a lot of these macro economic topics that we talk about on a daily, right? But I mean, really, we have a big decision coming up. We were just talking about that earlier about the Fed. Two hours and counting. You're counting it. I mean, a lot of people are counting it. And I think we have to really showcase that this trickles down to anybody. We will feel the impacts. Small business owners will feel the impacts. Home buying homeowners. They will also be feeling the impacts on whatever the decision may be in the next two hours or so. Yes. Yes. And two hours and a half hours to the fireworks. That would be the Powell Pressor. Keep it tuned. All right. Thank you for that, Danny Romero. All right. Now with a little bit of time left, we do want to take a final check with the markets on the Wi-Fi interactive. And we see the Dow down about eight basis points today. S&P 500 down to 44 NASDAQ down just under 1%. You can see nesting, nessling there by the lows of the day. All eyes turning to the Fed in a couple hours here. We're going to get that big announcement that we're going to bring to you live at 2 p.m. And then at 2.30 p.m. as I was just mentioning, we got that Powell Pressor. Now what you're looking at now, that is a NASDAQ 100. And we can see Apple down 1%. So is Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla almost down 2%?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,30,2022-11-02 15:57:42
4637," that power pressure. Now what you're looking at now, that is a NASDAQ 100 and we can see Apple down 1% so is Microsoft Alphabet. Tesla almost down 2% Amazon down a little bit more and let's take a look at the chip sector. We got some positive earnings and news from AMD that stock on the upper right that is up over 2% so is what applied materials and Nvidia. Now taking a look at the sector leaders, only utilities and industrials are up about a quarter percent each. For the downside it's still those mega caps that are lagging now consumer discretionary tech communication services are the leaders but we're going to see some more movement in a couple hours so stay tuned for now. I'm Jared Glickry. Thank you for watching. For the holiday shopping season, our next guest though expects sales to be weighed down by heightened inflationary pressures as non-disgressionary prices continue to rise. Bank of America retail analysts Lorraine Hutchinson joined us now. Hi Lorraine, thanks so much for being here. I mean we all know the pressures that are out there right from rising prices for things you need so you have less to spend on things that you want. So talk to us about the holiday season and how all of this plays out. Do you expect people to be buying fewer things or less expensive things or all of the above? Thanks good morning. Our holiday forecast calls for just over 1% sales growth. We do expect people to be using their money more frugally given the pressures they're facing on the non-disgressionary parts of their budget. What we're also expecting is on the discretionary side, a lot of their money's been used this year on vacations, eating out. Things we couldn't necessarily do a lot of last year. So it makes for a little bit of a tougher holiday for the consumer. We would expect them to be much more focused on value and much more focused on looking for deals this holiday season. Does that signal that household balance sheets are not healthy as some banks have told us this earnings season? Look, our, you know, our view.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,31,2022-11-02 16:02:17
4638," and much more focused on looking for deals this holiday season. Does that signal that household balance sheets are not healthy as some banks have told us this early season? Look, our, you know, our BAC card data and the work of our institute says that the balance sheets still are healthy. It's just a little, we've seen a little bit of pullback in spending in September. And we think that that bodes poorly for the interest in really spending up this holiday season. So we think the consumer's still in good shape, just a little bit more cautious than last year and allocating their dollars to different things. Lorraine, one key problem in retail ahead of this holiday season. We were just showing the chart on inventory growth. The retail industry is a wash in inventory. There is a lot of discounting in this environment. Who sees the biggest gross profit margin pressure operating margin pressure? And who's at risk of, you know, coming out in early January and issuing a major earnings warning? Yeah, look, we have earnings coming up for retail. We think that they will issue pretty cautious outlooks for 4Q because retail inventories are at all time record highs. Now, some of this is because they brought in inventory early. Remember last year the shelves were bare. They stocked out of a lot of goods. So they wanted to make sure they were in stock. But a portion of it is also they were forecasting demand that just hasn't materialized. So we've seen the consumer take a little bit of a step back in mid June and then we've seen some slowing since then in September. So we think there is too much where we see the biggest risk or those retailers targeting the lower income consumer. You've seen excess inventory levels at retailers like old Navy, like Coles, where the consumer is just has it's just a little bit tighter. On the good news side who cleans up those messes, the off price retailers, they really thrive on problems with the inventory and and excess thereof. So we think that retailers like TJ Maxx, Burlington, raw stores will be getting a tremendous amount of really high quality, well branded inventory really starting this quarter. The rain, that's the glass half full part of the equation. I want to go back to the glass half empty part of the equation because we all have been getting this sort of increasingly desperate emails right from some of the retailers offering heavy discounting some of the retailers. The big guys like Target and Walmart, they've said we're really addressing this inventory build up. But across the board and retail, do you think that the inventory glut is going to get worse before it gets better? Is the discounting working to work off that inventory? So we expect the mismatch between supply and demand to peak in the fourth quarter. So we do think holiday will be very promotional. You will get some great deals and that'll help us stretch to consumer. We do expect though that as we hit the end of the fourth quarter. So for retail, that's end of January that they will have worked through it. We think January will be a very heavy clearance period as most of the retailers are laser focused on exiting the winter season with appropriate levels. When we look to the first half of fiscal 2023, most retailers already had a chance to cut orders. So when spending pulled back a little bit in June and July, most retailers called their factories and their partners and told them to make less they cut they canceled. And so we do see some improvement in that in the first half of 23. Now that doesn't mean that they'll be pristine, but versus 4Q, we think they'll be in much better shape. All right, one of your top picks is Starbucks. Now there's this new CEO getting ready to take the helm there. Have you met with him? Have you talked to him about his plan for the company looking out over the next few years? So Starbucks is actually covered by one of my colleagues that it was one of our top holiday picks in my sector. My top holiday pick is tapestry, which owns coach and Kate's paid. So, well, to give us give us more details on this is do you think in general that the higher end consumer is going to be more resilient here? And that's why you like tapestry or do you think tapestry is doing something in particular right even in the luxury universe? I think a little bit of both actually, you know, we think tapestry is one of the few retailers that really did transform during the pandemic. And they took a few actions that we think are really important for the staying power of their earnings. They cut a lot of costs and reinvested those in marketing. They eliminated the bottom 40% of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,32,2022-11-02 16:06:30
4639," actions that we think are really important for the staying power of their earnings. They cut a lot of costs and reinvested those in marketing. They eliminated the bottom 40% of their styles to make their equipment more efficient. And they also added an e-commerce business to their outlet business, which we think added a new customer, a younger customer. So those things combine to give us more confidence in the sustainability of their high teens margins. And with those high teens margins come great cash flow. So we're expecting tapestry to buy back 7% of its stock and pay a 3% yield every year. And given the stock is near-troth multiples at five times EBITDA, we think that sets up really nicely into holiday and into 2023. So Cryptocurrency exchange finance helping to fund Elon Musk's deal for Twitter to tune of $500 million. Binance says it hopes to help Twitter buy better and corporate and crypto into the platform. Here to talk about that prospect, Chang, Peng, Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance and our very own crypto reporter David Hollerick. CZ, always good to see you. Thanks for giving us some time here. Is this more of a bet on Elon Musk or more of a bet on the future of Twitter's platform? I think to be honest, it's a bit of both. I think first of all, we want to sports free speech. And this is one of the best choices, the best chances to do that. Elon Musk is a very strong entrepreneur. We want to support him too. And crypto, Twitter is a ton square for crypto and most of the worst hard topics. So it's a good place to support free speech. And CZ, you know, Elon Musk has sort of gone back and forth at least from what we've seen in court documents that showed his text messages. He was initially talking about doing sort of a blockchain Twitter to improve some of the problems he's laid out for the company. And then he also has said that maybe that's not possible. Maybe it just won't work. And I'm curious to this juncture, what you're thinking about a crypto implementation or Twitter might look like and how realistic you think it is. I think Twitter today is a centralized platform. So moving that in one giant step into a fully decentralized platform is going to be quite difficult. I think we've got to get there in incremental steps. And for any.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,33,2022-11-02 16:10:48
4640," So moving that in one giant step into a fully decentralized platform is going to be quite difficult. I think we got to get there in incremental steps. And for any entrepreneur or any company in today's environment, we got to make many adjustments as time goes on. So it's very natural for his stock process to change over time. But overall, Elon is a very strong entrepreneur and we want to support him. So, see, Elon has been making some strategic moves with regard to who he's placing within Twitter, who he's bringing over from Tesla into the new Twitter that he sees moving forward. He's even said previously that the Twitter board that he decides to put together won't be paid if he was successful in acquiring the company. Post acquisition and knowing how much you believe that Twitter could improve with some of the same technology that Binance already has perhaps and the same ethos as well, is this a position that you would want on Twitter's board? I'm not against it, but I'm also not actually pursuing it. I'm not very good sitting on boards. I don't enjoy those type of long meetings, etc. But if my help is needed, I'm happy to, but I'm pretty busy running Binance. We want to keep all the support we can, but we'll see what Elon decides. Speaking of sticking to your knitting and running Binance, I mean, we see obviously Elon Musk, who is running a couple other companies. Now he's doing Twitter. And the initial reports coming out, frankly, have the feel of throwing spaghetti against the wall, as we say. In other words, maybe we'll charge people for the checkmarks. Maybe we'll take away free ads from Twitter blue. Like, there's all this stuff sort of trickling out. It doesn't feel like there is a unified strategy coming from Musk right now at Twitter. As an investor, and as a user, what do you want to see? I think that's very, very normal. As an investor, as a user, and also a fellow entrepreneur, I think it's very common to have many different ideas and see what sticks. So it's really literally like throwing spaghetti on the wall and just hope something sticks. That's entrepreneurship. So many different ideas should be tried and should be tried quickly. I think that my, as a user, might be as problem with Twitter is over the last year or a couple years, there hasn't been a lot of new features being introduced. There should be new features every month, every week, every day. And we just see what sticks. That's very normal. Like, what's easy? Like, what would be the thing that you would want to see from Twitter in terms of a new feature? I actually agree with a lot of what Elon's idea is, edit button. The way, let's block spam bots. There's a lot of bots that spam me my comments section when I open my tweets for comments. And blue ticks, they should become more, they should be a cost to it. I actually really support that idea. So all of this shouldn't really take more than a week to implement each. So we should have done that like, you know, a year ago. So I'm very supportive of Elon's idea. Let's, let's move quickly. Let's try new ideas. Yeah, to that point too, as one of the largest benefactors of cryptocurrency trading volume, thinking of this whole bot situation, there are, we know from the crypto side of Twitter that there are plenty of accounts that share coins and pump the price and things like that. So I'm curious, given that you're also thinking about the free speech mentality on Twitter, how do you think that problem is solved? Now that you have a financial stake. I think there's a balance between free speech and also pump and dump marketing manipulation, hate speech, just or just pure lying or fake information. So there has to be a line that to be drawn. It's not an easy problem to solve to be honest, but I think Elon's in a much better position to solve that problem than the look to the screen currently. There's too many spam balls on Twitter today. And so with regard to the hate speech, though, do you think that there is a significant policy change that needs to be enacted in order to make sure that that is removed from the platform, that it is not just a place for free speech, but also a place where free speech is not convoluted with hate speech on the platform? I think that's a very fine line to draw. It's going to be tricky. I think...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,34,2022-11-02 16:15:07
4641," where free speech is not convoluted with hate speech on the platform. I think that's a very fine line to draw. It's gonna be tricky. I think between hate speech and free speech, that's a very fine line. But some of the other stuff are much more clear. Fake news, spam, spam, much easier. So, you see, one part of making a good return on investment like this is Elon running an effective business, whether it's sales or profits, do you support him laying off 75% of that Twitter workforce to get those profits? I think those are the two different things. I think laying off a portion of the staff is just to become more efficient. Twitter today doesn't have a very strong business model, but it could potentially have very strong business models. So I think those two things are separate. It's not to say, I think revenue is not by saving cost. Not revenue doesn't come from saving cost. That's, I think Twitter's ability to generate revenue via C, via C is cost center today. There's many new revenue models that can be implemented on Twitter, like charging for blue ticks, even charging for comment, issue NFTs for each tweet, issue on token in the future. So all of those things can generate revenue for Twitter and it's not limited by the cost savings. Winx Stop is coming off a better than expected quarter for sales. As diners embrace the company's new chicken sandwich, it also helps from our profit perspective that chicken wing prices have started to, or they have flown lower. Let's check in with Winx Stop CEO, Michael Skipper. Mike Good to see you as always. Last time we talked to you guys, we're really one of the first restaurants to call out deflation. Are you still seeing those deflationary prices? And how long do you think it will last? Brian, we are. We're enjoying meaningful deflation in our business today. Just as we wore back when we spoke a quarter ago. And as we look at some of these leading indicators around our overall supply chain, it seems to suggest a backdrop of continued favorability from a commodity perspective for the balance of 2022 and into the beginning of 2023. A lot of new menu items that you've rolled out over the course of this year, Michael, how do you continue to kind of look through some of the performance indicators and in different markets as you kind of continue to look through the menu and what consumers even regard this as pricing,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,35,2022-11-02 16:19:39
4642," of the performance indicators and in different markets as you kind of continue to look through the menu and what consumers even, regardless of pricing, what they're gravitating towards right now. Yeah, WingStop's in a really unique spot in that in the second quarter our business was hit with the perfect storm and we were able to lean into a proven value playbook as well as pull some unique growth levers that we have as a brand and one of those being leaning into menu innovation and introducing chicken sandwich to consumers out there. First time we've done that as a brand and we think that's a meaningful long term sustaining a sales driver for our business and just launching that along with some of the other levers we pulled translated to a 6.9% same store sales growth in the third quarter and what's really great about that growth is the majority of that came with transaction growth. I think we've talked to you about this last time Michael with the prices, the raw material prices coming down for you guys. I don't imagine your cutting prices for consumers but I imagine maybe you're keeping them steady. How long do you, do you, I mean for the foreseeable future do you think we'll see some stability there? We've talked about the unique spot we're in this year where we haven't had to take any price where the rest of the industry to manage their margins has had to take meaningful price this year and you're seeing that start to impact some of the transactions in their business and we've been able to lean into that value playbook and not necessarily take any price this year and percent consumers with meaningful value so they can enjoy that indulgent wingsstop occasion. Michael my team here doesn't think I watch football but I in fact do and I was watching football and I've seen you guys start to pop up on TV. Are you getting return on that investment in the NFL and what does it look like? We are Brian we're seeing a meaningful increase in our investment and advertising this year. The back half of this year we're increasing our investment over 35% and you're seeing this as you mentioned show up in a big way in in in NFL as well as the NBA that's just kicked off in life sports and that's helping us close the gap that we have in brand awareness to other national brands that are out there and again another one of those multiple sales driving levers that we have that give us confidence in our ability to deliver our 19th consecutive year of same store sales growth this year. Are people coming in store are they ordering through digital app what is that touch point especially when you think about that customer acquisition cost and the awareness generation that you're ramping up right now. Yeah wingsstop's been an industry leader from an investment in digital and we had a really strong digital business before the pandemic hit and then obviously we saw explosive growth during the pandemic in our digital business already a business that was heavy off premise over the last three years through the third quarter we've seen ourselves grow north of 36% and that digital business that our reference is over 60% of our business today and that's a stickiness that we've been able to really hold since consumers have started to normalize their behavior a little bit to pre pandemic behaviors but those digital customers that we've brought into our brand we've been able to hold on to them and continue to build from there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,36,2022-11-02 16:23:51
4643," you Please welcome back Welcome back. Shares of SoFi, surging this morning after the financial services company topped analyst expectations for Q3 and raised their full year guidance. So for the third straight quarter, joining me now to discuss results of CEO Anthony Nodo and Yahoo! Finances, Brian Sasi, also in the house. Anthony just want to ask you about the results here. Double your GapNet revenue of 56% to $424 million. How would you describe these results? The results really reflect the diversification that we benefit from because we are one stop shop for financial services products and that we provide the ability to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect. So we're seeing businesses like personal loans, asset businesses like home loans and student loans in addition to our SoFi Checking and Sales Account. We're offering 2.5% on checking with direct deposit and 3% later this week on savings. Having really strong account openings which leads to deposits and leads to more spending. We're seeing very strong trends in invest which is also diversified. We have single stocks as well as cryptocurrency, Robo accounts and ETFs. Then we also have a credit card insurance product. So the continued growth that we're seeing with our 6th consecutive quarter of revenue is a reflection of our ability to overcome market volatility, the macro economic backdrop because of the diversification of the businesses that we have. Anthony mentioned on the earnings call a little while ago that you haven't really had a year where everything came together. Do you think you have that year next year? I think from a SoFi operating standpoint we do. This year we spent transitioning to a bank. Last year we spent transitioning to a public company and navigating the process with a SPAC merger into a public company. The year prior to that we were still in build out mode on the technology stack platform or Galeo and Texas businesses are doing quite well and that was a big part of the story back in 2020. And all that time really dealing with a depressed student loan refinancing business because of the federal student loan moratorium. So the economy is definitely volatile and there's a lot of uncertainty. If it stays at a contraction of minus 2 or minus 1%, I think we're going to be well positioned to continue to drive great trends, especially with the student loan moratorium ending in December. And when that does end in December, Anthony, what does that mean for your first half results next year? Is it a profit boom? What does it look like? There's so many variables that we'd have to know to answer that question. I think if the environment is exactly the same as today, which is unlikely, we definitely benefit from our resurgence in student loan refinancing demand and still strong trends in the businesses that are doing well now. And we believe our homeland business will be in a much better position by early next year, given the number of changes that we've made in the technology and the ability to close faster on a purchased mortgage, which is more critical than in a refinancing market. So I feel like we're going into the year set up to do really well and set more records. If the economy stays where it is or slightly less from a contraction standpoint, we're going to really, really good spot. We want a compound growth, we grew 51%. This quarter and a year, your basis in revenue with really strong profits and 61% number growth. We want to keep those growth rates quite high. Anthony, your company is growing strong. And I want to know if there's anything in your earnings results that would indicate trends, maybe that reflect what's going on in the larger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,37,2022-11-02 16:28:06
4644," Hi. Anthony, your company is growing strong. And I want to know if there's anything in your earnings results that would indicate trends, maybe that reflect what's going on in the larger economy, something that might surprise us, or just kind of confirm what's going on, the big picture here. Well, the higher interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising them to try to offset inflation and cool down the economy is driving a refinancing boom for personal loans. People are refinancing at a revolving rate debt and to fix rate term debt. And so that is, that business is definitely benefiting from, from that trend. The interest rates that we're providing on checking at 2.5% and 3% on savings later this week are a direct result also of higher interest rates. We are passing on the rate increases in our other products and the deposits that we're getting are allowing us to do that at a lower, lower cost. So there's a lot of complimentary elements of our business where one fuels the next. We call that the financial services productivity loop. And that's what you're seeing play out in our results. Anthony, switching gears just a little bit. As the former CLO and CFO of Twitter, what is your take on everything we've been seeing there? I would say first and foremost, I think Twitter has unbelievable potential. And that potential needs to be unlocked through the right product innovations. I think historically, you know, the company what I've seen has great potential. It has the best content in the world, regardless of what's happening in the world. You can see that on Twitter. The challenges, the content is there. It's hard to extract it through the product interface. And there's always been this challenge of getting consensus view or everyone on board inside the company or at the board level. And I think for the first time you have a single owner and a single leader that could be decisive. And the reason that's so critical is you need to iterate at an incredibly fast base to figure out what types of product changes will actually unlock that value. And it's really hard to do in a state where there are so many stakeholders that have a say. Now, there's one that gets the control of decisions and the consequences and the accountability. And I think that's the right form of whether it's the right team and they picked the right things. And they execute well, I have no perspective. What type of products do you think would work? What does charging 50 bucks to get on the platform or for the blue check mark? Does that make sense? You know, I was having fun with the debate on Twitter hopping into that conversation. I have a lot of insights of what would work, but it's not really my position to talk about them. It's really up to that team to execute the way they see fit. But I think they should have billions of users given the content they had that's so valuable. And they should be valued in hundreds of billions of dollars, not tens of billions of dollars. And I like that value. It looks like we've got time for another one. I happen to be reviewing your Twitter feed earlier this morning. I know you're a big affixionado of the NFL having served in an executive capacity there at one time. Any predictions for the season? I don't have any predictions for the season. Other than we really love our relationship with Stan Kronke, the Los Angeles Rams and Dean Spanos from the Los Angeles Chargers. It's been a great partnership with them. It's really provided us with the leverage in building our brand awareness that we thought it would. They far exceeded expectations with what they have at the venue that just announced two shows of for Taylor Swift at the end of her tour, which will be phenomenal. We had the Super Bowl last year. The Olympics will be there as well as the World Cup and this year the College Football Championship. So I call it the eighth wonder of the world. It's an iconic platform. Every artist, sports league, we'll want to play in that platform. And it's for an agreed partnership that's brought us really strong credibility and awareness. So it couldn't be happier with the relationship. I'm excited about the New Taylor Swift album. Big fan, big big fan, huge. I'm excited about anything that causes you guys to cover, and SoFi Stadium for a media standpoint. Well done sir. Talk about it as much as you can. We're all getting excited.

Our next guest has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his work covering the Fed and is out with a new book on the former Fed Chair and Current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Nice to have John Hilsenwath, Jim, apparently. I'll see you're a writer for the Wall Street Journal in studio with us. I'd be so much worse. Yeah, believe me today. Probably, right? Good to see you, man. So look on Twitter. No one, no better barometer. Exactly. So let's talk about tomorrow's meeting, all but certain, as we mentioned, their 75 point hike. What's your biggest question about what we'll hear from Jerome Powell? Well, you know, I think, so he's kind of opened the door to slowing down the pace of rate increases. And the question is, does he open the door a little bit? How is he open the door? Well, he said, if we see clear and convincing evidence that inflation is slowing, then we'll consider it. So the question is whether in the meeting itself, they've started to talk about that. Frankly, I actually think the really important moment isn't tomorrow. It's not the Fed meeting. It's next Thursday, because next Thursday is when the CPI inflation numbers come out. And he said they want to see clear and convincing evidence. So that's when you look for the clear and convincing evidence. Do you think they have seen it? No. Okay. No, I think that they've been disappointed. There were starting to see some signs of it this summer, and the last couple of readings in the CPI reports were very disappointing. So, John, what about some of these issues or concerns that people have that the Fed isn't taking enough time for things to digest and be reflected in the real economy? I think that's a totally fair and legitimate question. And it's surprising to me that you don't hear more of that coming out of the Federal Open Market Committee itself. You know, there's a lot of very independent, minded Federal Reserve Bank presidents who you would think some of them would say at this point, all right, we've done a lot. Let's slow things down and see how it's doing. But Jerome Powell has the Fed really moving in the direction that he wants. And that's to move very aggressively. I think one of the real concerns is that there's a lot of momentum that you get behind Fed decisions. And they do three quarters of a percentage point. It's hard to get off that because if they slow down, then everyone says, oh, they're going to stop. And if they stop, everyone says, oh, they're going to cut rates. The market is always two steps ahead of them. So the Fed is kind of stuck in this path of continuing to do what they're doing because they're afraid that the market's going to get ahead of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,39,2022-11-02 16:36:45
4646," to them. So the Fed is kind of stuck in this path of continuing to do what they're doing or else because they're afraid that the market's going to get ahead of them. And John, just taking a step back, just your assessment of the economy right now, because when you take a look at the latest GDP report, when you take a look at the jobs out of that we got out this morning, job openings, every single thing or most data points, still point to the fact that it is a very resilient economy. Yet there is this fear out there that we are going to slip into our recession. Where do you stand on that debate? Well, we got a good GDP report a week or so ago, 2.6% in the third quarter and it contracted in the first half of the year. The worry is that, like, that's the best we're going to get this year. We're seeing a big slowdown in housing, we're seeing consumer spending slowdown. The rest of the world is looking very weak. So I think there, I mean, and the economists that we survey every quarter are saying recession in 2023. So I think that's a real risk. And I think the Fed has kind of potentially created a momentum behind all these rate increases that they're having a hard time scaling back, which is why they're going to be praying on Wednesday night, next Wednesday, not this Wednesday, that those inflation numbers start to soften. Because, you know, they probably would like to slow this thing down at this point. But the loose credibility, if they do it before the inflation numbers tell off a little bit. So John, when you think of the conversations behind this scene, when you do have these periods, and before the Fed makes an announcement like this, especially as you studied how Janet Yellen has moved in the family dynamic that came into sort of the policy making there, give us some insight into sort of the conversations that might be happening right now. Well, I mean, I think that the most important thing you have to think about when you're watching the Fed and the market is always watching the Fed is, it's a very glacial moving institution. Unless there's an actual crisis in their face when they can do things overnight, they tend to take months and months and months to move the ship in a new direction, which is why they were behind the curve on raising rates to begin with. Because it took them too long to say, oh, wow, we're out over our skis. We kept rates too low for too long. And they might be running into the same problem now on the back end of this that, you know, they're not going to want to see clearer and convincing evidence that's Jay Powell's terms before they slow the pace of rate increases. Well, by the time they've slowed it down and stopped it, we might already be in a recession. So, you know, what I would say about the debate is it's very slow moving. And I always try to kind of look at just kind of incremental changes. There's somebody new in there saying, well, what about this or what about that? And so if I mean, I haven't done these press conferences in a while, if I were doing it, I would want to know, well, how did the debate change? Not what did you do today, but what did you start talking about that we might see in the next meeting or two in December or January? So it's bottom line. Goldman has 75, 50, 25 and 25 again in March. Do you agree with that consensus? Oh, you know what? I don't. I don't. You don't do that. You don't do that. That's the answer. I mean, I think, you know, I kind of rather talk about kind of risks and stuff like that. And I think there's a risk that they're going too far and that they've moved too fast too far. And the risk, I think, is to the financial system. So, I mean, the economy has been growing, you know, very fast. It needs to slow down and I understand all that. But when the Fed raises rates aggressively, even when it raises rates slowly, stuff tends to break in financial markets. And so, you know, what I wonder about is what's breaking out there right now that we might be learning about in one, three, six months. And so, you know, we might find out about it. And, you know, we have to see inflation slow down. That's the bottom. That's been the bottom line all year. And it just hasn't happened, which is disappointing, I think, for every American right now. It is disappointing. It's certainly caught a Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen off guard, I think, a bit just in terms of how sticky this inflation has been. I know you had a number of conversations. We have a new book here on set. Congratulations. I think we're holding that up. Of course, of course. I've got your bottle of champagne on your mic. Very old crack and open for it. But I guess you're take away from the biggest lessons that maybe she has learned and are more than two decades in Washington. And then also point you to the fact that there have been some rumors that she could be stepping aside as Treasury Secretary Paul.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,40,2022-11-02 16:41:09
4647," Biggest lessons that maybe she has learned in her more than two decades in Washington and then also pointed to the fact that there have been some rumors that she could be stepping as high as Treasury Secretary following the midterms or thoughts on that. And I guess who could potentially be the next Treasury Secretary? Right. So let me take the last question first. So I asked her about this just a week and a half, two weeks ago. And she said to me very emphatically, she does not intend to leave the job. And that she likes doing it. She thinks it's important. She could see herself staying there for four years. Given the fact that these rumors have been going around, I doubt she would have said that unless A, she had really thought it through. And B, unless she knew she was talking on the Wall Street Journal, I don't think she would have said it unless she had told the White House she was going to say it. So when she said she plans to stick around after the midterms, I believe her. Right now there's a lot of rumors out there. But you never know where they're coming from, they just kind of float around in Washington and sometimes, you know, and they get repeated. When the person who the rumors are about says, I don't intend to leave very publicly, I don't know. I mean, maybe I'll be caught off on this, but you know, I doubt she would have said it unless she believed it and she had told the White House she was going to say it. And then the biggest lessons from the 20 years. So you know, that's a big, that's a big, long answer. I'll say two things. First of all, you know, there's a lot of ideological debate in Washington and over the airwaves and, you know, conservative policies, liberal policies, spend too much, tax too little. What I found is that in watching her careers, that the big mistakes that have been made over the years, they haven't been ideological. It's been human error. It's been kind of misjudging where you are right now. So this inflation is a great example of it. So the federal government dumped money into the economy during COVID. In part because we had been through a decade of very low inflation and they thought they could. And they were learning the lesson of the last expansion and applying it to this one. And they just, they fought the last war and they misread the situation and now we have inflation. I would call it human error more than ideological error. And it boggles my mind because we debate ideological issues all the time, but it's really like, are you making the right, and this is what she said to me, you've got to look at the facts on the ground right now and read the environment. The other thing I'd say about Janet Yellen that kind of drew me to the story is this is a woman in a very male dominated field. A field that hasn't been very friendly, frankly, to women over the years. She broke every single glass ceiling in that field and I think you can learn some lessons about the workplace balancing work and family from her story. One of the great parts of the story that I focus on in the book, it's actually a love story. Yellen and her husband, the partnership that the two of them formed, you know, him taking on full respect, this guy won a Nobel Prize in economics, right? He took on full responsibilities at home and she took on, you know, equal responsibilities in the workplace and the two of them together became the most powerful influential couple in the economics industry by creating a partnership, equal partnership on both sides. It's a really interesting story. Yeah, certainly a remarkable story. And like you said here in the title, Yellen, the trailblazing economist who navigated an era of upheaval. John Hilton, great to have you on set. Thanks so much for joining us. It was fun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,41,2022-11-02 16:45:35
4648," you you Subscribers September 2011 2014 on Wall Street with revenue up 18% from just a year ago for more on that we want to bring in Connor Flynn CEO of Kimco Realty Connor. It's great to see you again. So it doesn't look like when we talk about the fact that the real estate market is slowing down a possible recession looming. Obviously you would think what I mean. Pretty concerning time for your business. Kimco though seems to be in a pretty great position. What's your assessment just of where you stand and what we could likely see over the coming months? That's great to see you too. Thanks for having me. You know, Kimco is in the sweet spot of retail right now. Grocery anchored shopping centers, which is what we primarily own, continues to be in the retail revival. You're seeing it with demand across all the different square footages that we have in our shopping centers. And a lot of it has to do with some major takeaways that we were net beneficiaries of the pandemic. So the big key is really understanding that brick and mortar versus e-commerce. That debate is really settled. It really is a combination of the two that is the sweet spot that makes retailers more profitable and connect deeper with with their consumer. And that's what's really driving the robust demand across our shopping centers is when you think about the big powerhouses of e-commerce, they're actually all opening physical stores. And they're using those stores not only to sell merchandise out of it, but using it as last mile distribution fulfillment. And that's the game changer. That's really what's driving our robust results and allowing us to beat and raise multiple times this year. Oftentimes we've heard about the death of brick and mortar conner and yet the numbers are astounding right now. Retail vacancies in the second quarter, 6.1 percent, the lowest in 15 years, more stores opened than closed in 21 for the first time since 1995. What is pushing people back to stores? And in some cases away from e-commerce. Well, I think a lot of it has to do with human nature. I think when something is taken away from you, all of a sudden you start to realize how much you really need that or you want it. And I think that's what happened. And what we're seeing is a robust surge in services. So a lot of people during the pandemic really spent all of their dollars on goods. And now you're seeing it really shift back towards the service part of the economy. And with the growth-drinkered shopping center, that only comes down to the hair salons, the nail salons, a lot of the medical, the health and wellness uses that are doing quite well today. So you're seeing it across the spectrum of what really works today in retail. And the fascinating part is the consumer still is engaging in the shopping center on a higher rate than they were even last year. And that's good news for shoppers and that's good news for retailers and obviously where sales go, we can increase rents then. And when you take a look at some of the, I guess, some of your larger tenants, you have all the big names from T.J. X to Home Depot to Whole Foods as your anchor tenants. They make up about 54% of your space there. But you also have large exposure to small shop tenants, maybe a 46% of your portfolio. With the risk of recession, fears that maybe some of the smaller shops won't be able to pay their rent. Are you starting to see any evidence of this? We're looking for it, but we haven't seen any cracks yet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,42,2022-11-02 16:49:42
4649," the smaller shops won't be able to pay their rent. Are you starting to see any evidence of this? We're looking for it, but we haven't seen any cracks yet. And one of the things to keep in mind with the small shops, which sometimes makes you think about maybe the local Pizzeria, our small shops are large national chains. So JP Morgan Chase is actually the largest small shop tenant that we have in the portfolio. And you go across the top 50 small shops and all of them are national and typically a high credit rated company. So we've seen it just across the board in terms of demand right now, really driving our results. And it's a nice part to be where I can let the results speak for themselves because a lot of people had made up their mind on physical brick and mortar retail and you could talk until you're blue in the face and sometimes better just let the results speak for themselves. Just curious what you make of these new numbers out from alignable that show 37% of small businesses unable to pay their rent for the month of October. The number we just showed 50% in Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey right there on its heels, Pennsylvania, also in the top five, these are states where you have properties. Yeah, that's an interesting stat. I mean, think about the Kimco consumer and the Kimco shopping center. We're typically the first ring suburb in the major metropolitan areas across the country. And that's where the affluent shopper continues to engage in the in the shopping center. I'm thinking that that stat may include maybe some of the lower demographic areas. And when you think about the inflationary pressures that people are really dealing with today, that's where we've seen, I think the lower demographic really feel the brunt of the issues that are that are facing the economy today is the inflationary impact is really having a dramatic effect on that lower demographic profile. Fortunately, Kimco is positioned really in the higher affluent areas, the first ring demographic, the first ring suburb is where again, you saw the suburbanization effect take hold in the pandemic. So again, we were in a beneficiary from that migration pattern. And Connor Flynn, always great to have you CEO of Kimco Realty. We look forward to having you back again soon. Thanks for joining us. Music raising rates of, led to tough times in the housing market, both buyers and sellers stuck on the sidelines with the 30-year fixed north of 7% for the first time in 20 years. There are some exceptions to the rule, however. Alyssa Helman is a broker for my Southern view. Alyssa nice to see you. So the Wall Street Journal, Emerging Markets Index, lists Johnson City, Tennessee. I feel like I should sing it every time, thanks to Derrius Rucker. That's number one on the list ahead of Viselia, California, Elkerton, D.A.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,43,2022-11-02 16:54:14
4650," Johnson City Tennessee. I feel like I should sing it every time thanks to Derrius Rucker. That's number one on the list ahead of Vesalia, California, Elkord, Indiana, North Port floor to Fort Wayne, Indiana round up the top five in your town. Raleigh, North Carolina, cracking the top 10. What do these cities have in common in terms of real estate markets? Absolutely. So I think the biggest thing that you're seeing with rising rates is affordability has gone dramatically down. And so when you look at markets like Johnson City, like Brawley, the one thing that a lot of those places having come in is you can still find affordable homes and compete in a way that a lot of these really competitive markets such as San Francisco, Chicago, places where buyers were really priced out, they can still with higher interest rates compete and afford in some place like Johnson City or Brawley. Now it's interesting because Alyssa, we know a lot of people move to sub-urbs, they move to other areas for affordability reasons when they were able to work remotely because of the pandemic. But do you think that's going to be the case now as employers put more pressure on some workers to return to the office? I do. I actually have seen 2021 and 2022 both were years where I saw a dramatic influx of relocation buyers coming to Raleigh, not unlike many of the other markets that you guys mentioned, but part of that was getting priced out in these bigger markets. Right now, when you look at interest rates, you're talking about the average 30 year fixed being 7%. That means that 85% of current homeowners have a lower rate. And so it doesn't make a lot of sense for those folks to move. So when you start looking at affordability, how can I afford my next place? Where do I want to be for five, 10 years? A lot of those other markets are really coming into play and coming into the conversation where folks are saying maybe I want to be closer to family. Maybe I want to be somewhere else where my paycheck isn't stretched as thin as it is in other markets. In particular, those first time buyers who really been priced out, I think those the ones you're finding in that top 10 list. So let's talk about the underlying issue here, which of course mortgage rates continue to get worse. If you can put in context, what a mortgage rate means when it's north of 7% in terms of how much more an average monthly payment has gone up. And if I can tack on to that, how high do you expect rates to get in the next six months? Yeah, so I'll answer the second part of that first because I think it's the less scary answer, I guess. My attitude is I think we've probably seen interest rates peak. I think that they've risen dramatically in the last six months and in a way that really wasn't predicted. The other element to that is we got pretty spoiled. Rates being lower than 4% for long periods of time, which we saw in 2020, 2021, a good portion of 2022, that's not the norm. It's not normal to see rates. It wasn't that long ago that I was closing homes at 2.75 or 3%. Those are dramatically low, low rates when you look at the historic history of where rates have been. So I do think that we've probably capped out where we're going to be. I don't think that we'll see a decrease back down to that necessarily 3% or 2.5% even, but I do think that we'll start to see a leveling off. The first part of your question, though, it's a big change. Homeowners are paying dramatically more just based on interest rates. What I'm having to have a conversation, especially with a lot of first time home buyers about, is if they got approved with a rate at 3.5%, 4%. I'm having to say to them, you really need to speak to the lender again before we go ahead and write an offer because rates have risen so much that it's actually priced some first time home buyers and some just in general buyers completely out of the price point they were looking. So they're having to just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,44,2022-11-02 16:58:25
4651," We priced some first time home buyers and some just in general buyers completely out of the price point they were looking. So they're having to just adjust the price point altogether. And I want to ask you about the inventory picture because obviously if you're a homeowner and you're seeing with these mortgage rates ahead and you want to sort of sit tight, enjoy your equity or perhaps wait till the market's frothy again. What is the expectations for inventory given the slow pace and the lack of confidence who've been seeing from home builders? Yeah, I actually think that's had a lot to do with this slow down. It's less about rates and more about where a lot of sellers are. We had an insanely low inventory, especially in Raleigh, for years due to the feeding frenzy that these low, low rates were causing. People were saying I'm not going to move because I don't know if I can compete in this craziness that the market is. Now you're seeing people saying rates have gone so high. I'm locked in at three and a half percent or four percent. Why would I go out and up size or downsize and be in a mortgage that's going to be more expensive at that rate? So I think you're seeing a lot of sellers stay put, but that said real estate is one of those basic human needs that is always going to function. So even in the recession of 2009, you saw people buying and selling homes. It still happens. We're still seeing need-based moves. We're still seeing people out there saying, hey, now that there's a little fewer buyers out there, maybe I can actually compete. Maybe I'm up against less competition. So there's some really good opportunities if you can find the right mortgage rate. The other element to that that I think is really important is we're so used to saying, okay, I'm closing on this house. I've gotten my mortgage and now I can forget about mortgage rates until I'm ready to buy again. That's not what we're advising anybody to do now. Instead I'm saying, go ahead, find the lowest rate that you can. But once you've bought, keep your eye on rates. When you see them start to decrease, look at refinancing and save yourself some money there just because you buy at a current rate right now. It doesn't mean that that's the rate that you have to stay at throughout the course of you owning that home. Refines of all but disappeared at the moment, Alyssa Helmer, nice to see you. Thanks so much. In this episode of influencers, Gregory Zuckerman, author of a shot to save the world. I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate it normally. I really do think it's modern science is greatest achievement. I believe that this pandemic is going to end but this virus is not going away. It's going to endemic. It's going to melt into the background but we're always going to have things dropping up. I write the same story all over and over and over. I write about overlooked, underappreciated individuals, achieving something that the experts told them they couldn't do. Hello everyone and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirwer. And welcome to our guest, Gregory Zuckerman, award winning journalist, special writer at the Wall Street Journal, an author of the new book, A Shot to Save the World, The Inside Story of the Life or Death Race for a COVID-19 vaccine. Greg, nice to see you. Great to see you Andy. So congratulations on the book. A lot to talk about. You've noted that you wanted to focus on the triumphs of the triumphs, I guess you should say, of the development of the vaccine. And one thing you talked about was a lucky break that occurred with regard to MRNA research which occurred a couple years before the pandemic, which probably allowed for the rapid development of the vaccine. What would the world look like if the pandemic had arrived five years earlier? Do you think we'd still be waiting for a vaccine? It's a great question. So I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate the enormity of it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,45,2022-11-02 17:02:45
4652," You. It's a great question. So I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate the enormity of it. I really do think it's modern science is greatest achievement. And to your point, the technology was not ready a few years ago. So we need to be grateful that the pandemic that this virus emerged at a time when the scientists I write about in my book thought they had an approach that would work. They weren't sure we're talking the end of 2019 very early part of 2020. And they turned around the creativity is really effective protective vaccines. But again, a few years earlier, I don't think we would be nearly as lucky. But there's a few different types of science that have been applied to the different vaccines. You want to just go through them and sort of lay person's term, which I know is your specialty. Sure. So M RNA. We are familiar with that with that approach that vaccine approach because that created the Moderna as well as the Pfizer vaccines. M RNA short for messenger RNA, which is just a molecule we have inside of us. It transports instructions from the DNA to the part of the cell where proteins are created that we live on and it depends on every day. And it was always this sort of dream of scientists to create M RNA in the lab. Well, if it's so important in the body, maybe we could create a synthetic version just like there's, you know, sugar natural sugar and synthetic version of sugar. So the idea was, well, if we could create M RNA in the lab, we could tell our bodies to create any protein. And that was the idea. That's the gist of the M RNA approach. We is a vaccine. It sends a message and a message obviously in this case is an instruction for the body. The immune system to create the protein, the protein in this case is despite protein. So like any other vaccine, it's an education for the body. And the other approach I write about the adenovirus approach that leads to the J and J as well as the AstraZeneca vaccines. That's a really interesting one. Two. That one also took years in making and I read about how that began really with HIV effort to solve HIV. We haven't figured that one out yet, but they shifted these scientists and said, OK, we can't do HIV, but we're going to get a vaccine for COVID. Dan Baroque, one of the scientists working on that later endeavor, I spoke to has been at your right, been working on that for a very long time. But switching back to M RNA, you do focus a lot on Moderna, which could have been one of the biggest losers in the race for the vaccine, end up being a big winner. How much credit should the Moderna CEO get here? It sounds like his background as a salesman was sort of key in bringing us all together. Yeah, he's a fascinating character for years, people whispered about him. They suspected he was exaggerating murderers ability to create either vaccines or drugs. There wasn't much proof they were very secretive kind of firm. He was very hard on his employees. You could read about it in a book. People were collapsing in the office, out of the office at home hitting their heads, being rushed to the emergency rooms, he was firing people left and right. Very difficult. And yet inspirational too, and hard driving. And he had a vision. His vision was that M RNA was going to save lives. And he felt he needed to push his people hard. He's a little bit of a Steve Jobs kind of character in that regard. And he said, guys, one day we're going to be the ones to step up in a crisis. And he was right. And maybe it takes somebody like that. And like you said, he's a great salesman. And he raised billions and billions for Moderna over the years without any proof of concept. And people were jealous. There were a lot of envy in the industry, but turns out that that money was well spent to people made a lot of money investing in Moderna. Yeah, and I heard, you know, whispers in Boston in that biotech community about him for a while, just what you're sort of saying, Greg. And even while they were sort of getting up to speed that, you know, I mean, maybe charlatan is too strong a word, but they were serious doubters. Do you think those people, you know, are sort of eating crow right now? And in my book, I people compared him to Elizabeth Holmes. They said, just like Sarah knows, there's nothing there to this company Moderna. And you know, you can understand it to some extent, they didn't have any proof. They spent years working on drugs and outright in the book. They gave up on making mRNA work for drugs. They had to pivot to vaccines because it wasn't working with drugs and vaccines is not a really popular area for a lot of pharmaceutical companies. So are they eating crow? Yes. But, you know, there is some reason why they were skeptical all those years, but in the end, they were wrong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,46,2022-11-02 17:07:08
4653," popular area for a lot of pharmaceutical companies. So are they eating crow? Yes. But there is some reason why they were skeptical all those years, but in the end they were wrong. Right. Operation work speed. Where do you come out on that? I mean, this was a Trump administration program. Controversial, there were some, let's just say, colorful people steering it. But was it effective, Greg? So like most every other topic in society today, it's sort of black and white, against you. Either Operation Warp Speed saves everything, and we have to give Donald Trump all the credit, or it was useless. I come down somewhere in the middle, meaning that Operation Warp Speed was very helpful. There were a lot, there's a lot of money that was given to these companies, resources too. I'm a little park that were necessary from all over the country that were brought to the necessary spots on bioperape, to Warp Speed employees, but you also have to remember that Warp Speed made an early bet on a different vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine. It did not give money to my journal early on, when it was desperate for money. And Moderna, as recently as May, 2020, was running out of money and couldn't get money from the government, could get money from private industry, from public, from foundations, from Merck. They went to Merck, and they were almost unable to create these vaccines. We won't be able to be grateful for what happened. So Operation Warp Speed was very helpful in the end, Moderna did get a lot of money from Operation Warp Speed, others did too, but you don't want to save all due to Warp Speed as a success of these remarkable vaccines. There is the perspective case where the government's going to suggest that everyone gets every...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,47,2022-11-02 17:11:36
4654," There is the perspective case where the government's going to suggest that everyone gets every person in America gets a booster, flies a booster as well, right? Or Moderna, and I think that is coming, right. And also just sort of down the road, I believe that this pandemic is going to end, but this virus is not going away. It's going to be endemic. It's going to kind of melt into the background, but we're always going to have things cropping up areas that aren't vaccinating. We're going to have issues. It's going to morph and it's going to, we've got more strains. I'm not saying this to people for people to be too concerned. I do think Pfizer, Moderna and the other companies can adjust their vaccines. So you'll go in and there'll be second and third generation vaccines. You'll go into a doctor's office and get a COVID vaccine, but it'll be in all in one, maybe with a flu of vaccine. Maybe they'll throw something else in there too. So I don't want people to be too discouraged, but the vaccine research is that a right about there trying to stay ahead of this thing. Yeah, I mean, is that a losing battle? Is it going to be like the flu? Are we going to continue to need new vaccines all the time? I mean, this seems like it's not going to just end as you suggest. Yeah, it won't. Right. Right. But I wouldn't call it a losing battle. I think we'll stay ahead of it. And these vaccines are so much more effective than the flu vaccine. So if you've got protection of 70, 80 percent and it's even high of our hospitalization in and death, it will allow us to return to some to normal say, really in society. You hear that other countries vaccines are not as effective, you know, like the Chinese vaccine. I don't know where the Russian vaccine stands. I heard there was one in Cuba that was not not effective at all. Like why is that? Well, they use different approaches. So I write in the book a little bit of the Russian approach is a variation on the one that you mentioned with Dan Beruk and the J&J one. It's not quite as good. And frankly, we just don't have as much data that's reliable. It doesn't help that Putin himself didn't take the vaccine for months and months. He wouldn't take it. So listen, if that was the only vaccine in the world, either the Russian one or the Chinese one, I think we would all embrace it and take it. It's largely effective, but just not as effective. mRNA as revolutionary as it is. It just is so much better than these other vaccines. How come Merck and Santa Fe and other companies that are known as leaders in this space were not at the fore? That's a great question. And frankly, when I started researching this book, I kind of expected the vaccine giants to be the ones to save us. I mean, Merck is the one that created the MMR vaccine that we're all familiar with. The Mums' measles were bella there, vaccine giant. So the Santa Fe is just saying GSK. And yet they started to drag their feet. I write about some internal rift within Merck about whether to pursue a vaccine for COVID-19 or not. GSK and Santa Fe teamed up. But their approach isn't quite very yet. I would argue that vaccines until this past year are not a really sexy area for big pharmaceutical companies. You get one every few years or once a year, once a lifetime maybe, so much you can charge for a vaccine. And as a result, I think the big pharmaceutical companies had mixed feelings about chasing after a vaccine for COVID-19. There's no money there. There is, as we're seeing now this past year, but at the time it wasn't clear and listen, you put all this work into it. And they've done this. Merck has chased vaccines in the past for things like Zeke and such that have dissipated, gone away and they wasted tons of money, resources, et cetera, opportunity cost was it was high. So if you're going to chase after a vaccine and when you don't even know if there's going to be a need for it by the time you develop it, it's a risky business proposition. Right. Moderna just recently announced an agreement with Gavi, which the vaccine alliance to ship more vaccine doses to areas around the world that are still behind in 2022. Is this too little too late? I think it's popular to criticize Moderna. You see how much money they're making. There are always these suspicions about them. I think the back of people's minds, they remember that, that those those questions and they're eager to criticize Moderna. I'm not here necessarily to defend them, but I do have to note that they didn't have a partner unlike Beyond Tech, which works with Pfizer, but you're to confine a partner, Merck turned them down. So they had to do it all themselves and they've been taxed. They've been going to the limit. I know that people internally, they believe that they wish they.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,48,2022-11-02 17:15:49
4655," and they're gonna merc turn them down. So they had to do it all themselves. And they've been taxed, they've been going to the limit. I know the people internally, they believe that they wish they had been able to produce more, but they're vaccine supplies were scooped up by the West. They paid the most and they got there early. And now they're trying to help elsewhere. Is it too little to lay? I would say it's slow and happening, but I also understand what's going on internally with a Moderna. They have just destroyed physically, psychologically. It's been a really difficult year, even though they made a lot of money. By the way, you just saw the little mystery in my brain, Greg, beyond tech. That's how you pronounce it. You know, there are different ways of pronouncing it, even internally, they pronounce it differently. Yes, that's why I pronounce it beyond tech. You can't go wrong that way. It's like Tesla and Tesla. We ask the people there how to pronounce it. They said either. Really? That's funny. I didn't know that. So what about mRNA research? What do you think the next breakthrough is gonna come from there and how will this change the development of future vaccines? So there's a lot of excitement now about what mRNA can do besides COVID-19. Uguca Sahin and Beyond tech have been working on cancer vaccines for many years. They're very excited to take the billions they're making right now and shift and focus on other pathogens, ailments. Oh, and so it's Moderna. So we're talking about everything from Lupus and MS, turning off the immune system, just like we've been able to turn on the immune system perhaps for autoimmune kind of issues. Malaria, some people are going after. Dan Brook, as you mentioned, AIDS. So some of these same vaccine specialists, revolutionary, pioneering researchers that I write about in my book are shifting to all kinds of new challenges. Now, I want to caution just a little bit because until his past year, mRNA has proved pretty disappointing when it comes to drugs. And there are some vaccines coming up and believe for things like RSV and CMV, some viruses that are very lethal and harmful for some people. But I want to have a little bit of caution in terms of revolutionizing the world. But I'm excited about the future. I want to ask you about vaccine hesitancy as someone who intricately knows how these vaccines came to be. What do you make of these continued conspiracy theories around them? And how much are they hurting efforts to get everyone vaccinated? So Andy, I speak to a lot of vaccine who hasn't had audiences and I enjoy doing so. There's always a split. There are some people who are reasonable and cautious. And for good reasons, they're wary. I get it. These vaccines were developed in 330 days from the time the sequence was revealed until they were authorized. And historically, that's just remarkable. I mean, the average vaccine took 10 years until last year and the fastest was four years. So here we are coming in three and a three days. So I understand that the waryness in mRNA has never been proved effective. That said, one of the reasons I wrote my book is to show that it was years of research. It wasn't done quickly. They didn't cut corners in any way. What we've been able to do, and partly, thanks to warp speed, was we were doing things simultaneously. We were developing, testing, and manufacturing of vaccine. That's never been done before. Why would he spend billions of dollars to manufacture vaccine? And it's not even authorized or approved yet. No one ever did it historically. So those are the reasons why I think some people were hesitant. And I think they should be reassured by the fact that the work corners caught. And this process, this research, these vaccine approaches took years, and that's partly why I wrote the book. Now, in terms of conspiracy people, conspiracists, you're not going to make much headway there, sadly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,49,2022-11-02 17:20:15
4656," you you you you you you you've been skeptical understanding correct of the that you've been skeptical the so called loudly naar theory l the l the l the l the l the l the l the l it l the l the l the l the l the lab. But the pandemic's origin has been really difficult to pin down definitively. How much of you focused on that question in your reporting and do you think we'll ever have a clear answer there? So I am skeptical of the lab leak. I'm even more skeptical of that China created this vaccine. And my reporting is based on talking to top of biologists, structural biologists, et cetera, around the world. And the view is that it's a little bit like HIV HIV for years. There were suspicion about that as well. People accused CIA and you've got government, you've got Army, KGB of creating this virus because there was no natural host. There was no evidence of the animal that had the original virus. And then they found one. It took years about a decade or so. And likewise, we haven't found the host here. But I think it will be identified. It takes a little bit of time. Those people who say it was created by China. And then they said, well, it won't spread in China. We'll only only make spread elsewhere. That seems preposterous. And the lab leak is a possibility. I'd say it's a five or 10% possibility. But if you just remember that animals were encroaching on and wild kingdom all the time, cutting down trees, their jump viruses are jumping all the time from animals. We start with SARS. We start with the earlier coronaviruses and tumors, others. So to expect this one to be unusual and surprising and to be a bit leaked, it's possible but unlikely. I'm an Occam's razor kind of guy. Right. Is the wet market, does that come into play you think or is that kind of a blind alley? No, I think there's a good possibility that it's spread there. I'm not sure. They're originated there necessarily. But historically, that's the first one spread too. The first SARS in China in a wet market is a good chance that that's how it's spread. Right. And in recent weeks, when we talked about the pill a little bit, I just want to last follow question on that. And so is that a big breakthrough or not? I think it is. I think it's going to be kind of a one to punch. That's really going to help.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,50,2022-11-02 17:24:20
4657," And I just want to last follow question on that. And so is that a big breakthrough or not? I think it is. I think it's going to be kind of a one to punch. That's really going to help us get out of this pandemic as long as people continue to get vaccinated. But we've got this backup of pills that are quite effective. I think modern science is going to be fixing this thing and addressing this thing and helping us out of this pandemic. Yeah. What do you make of Tony Fauci? I mean, is he this American hero or listening to both journalists or like, ah, it's not all that? Where is he all that Greg? What do you think? I think Tony Fauci is a hero. His whole life is dedicated to public health. It's a remarkable and quite frankly, just depressing idea that we as a people are part of our country have turned on those who look out for us. Is he perfect? No. He advised us early on not to wear masks. He couldn't have been more wrong about that. The real kinds of mistakes he and other scientists have made. But for Tony Fauci and his colleagues at NIH, others, they could have quit years ago and made a fortune in private industry. And they didn't. Why? Because they look out for our health and they're trying to give us good advice and guidance. And he's also pushing the research. And he behind the scenes made a lot of contributions in terms of these vaccine approaches that are right about in my books. So we owe him and his colleagues a great deal of gratitude. They're not perfect whatsoever to make the stakes left the right, but who doesn't? Yeah, I think you're so right making that point that of course you could have become the top scientist of the giant pharma company, the anonymous and very wealthy living in a nice suburb and all that. But he decided. And then we would criticize him for the revolving door and how dare they go private industry after a public, yeah, they get it criticized either way. Yeah. After everything has happened over the past 18 months, do you think we're better equipped now, better prepared for the next pandemic? Well, I think so given that mRNA has been proven and we figure out how to manufacture it efficiently, distribute it, took us a little while, but we've learned a lot of lessons in terms of trials as well. So mRNA now we can depend on. So the next big pathogen, lethal virus that emerges, I think we can adjust and create vaccines quite quickly. Other lessons I don't think we've learned to me as a nation, we don't look out for each other like we should where a group of individualists and that's helped us arrive at these vaccines. And only in America could we, these vaccines have been created granted. There's one from Germany, but even the German CEO I've talked to who said without American investors, venture capitalists, people rolling the dice on their approach years ago when they went public when they were raising money, these vaccines could not have been created. So there's a lot to be proud of as an American, there's also a lot to be discouraged about about how we get advice from our brother-in-law or some video that we saw on YouTube as opposed to our own internist, it's pretty discouraging both for me, but also for the creators, the pioneers that I talked to for my book, when they see that all their hard work has led to this split and some people were resistant and pointing fingers at them for their efforts, it's quite discouraging. And at times left that we have left, Chair Greg, I want to ask you a little bit about you and the process and writing books, how did you decide to do this particular book? So I was deep in my basement office in New Jersey, locked down like everybody else, and kind of discouraged about the world, and I thought it could be a fun project to trace and speak to the researchers, the scientists, the pioneering kind of remarkable innovators that are behind these vaccines. I didn't know at the time that they'd be proven effective, but I kind of made a bet that they would and I tracked them along the way. So in some ways it was a healthy distraction for me, gave me encouragement. And my book is about what went right, as opposed to what went wrong, I wanted it to be an upbeat book. That gives us hope about the future because these vaccine specialists, they're turned, they're focused on other pathogens and other illnesses and viruses, and we're gonna need them again sadly, I think in the years ahead. And finally, Greg, so this is one of several books you've written, is there a common thread or how do you choose what to write about? I mean, it's such a big commitment. I read the last one that you did about a gym and assignments was great, but you're kind of the rolling the dice yourself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,51,2022-11-02 17:28:48
4658," right about. I mean, it's such a big commitment. You know, I read the last one that you did about Jim Simon's was great, but you know, you're kind of the rolling the dice yourself in the sense that like you're picking some of your committing to it and you hope that it resonates, right? Yeah. So Andy, one can criticize me because and I only realized this after I started to pass in my manuscript, I write the same story all over again, over and over. I write about overlooked, underappreciated individuals achieving something that the experts told them they couldn't do. And I write about that over and over again, unlike the heroes, I just happen to that resonates with me. I find that fascinating. Why is it that conventional wisdom is so wrong so often? All my books and my first book was about the financial crisis and the individuals who anticipated it shouldn't have been these guys. Then I run by the energy revolution. It should not have been these fracas and Oklahoma who turned this country around and should have been Chevron and BP. And like you said, my last book to Mano Salda Market is about a bunch of scientists who don't even care so much about capitalism and business with the greatest investment for men history. And this time it's a group of companies and approaches that were overlooked. M-R-N-A and these companies, Pfizer, notwithstanding beyond tech as the key person, key company behind the vaccine, Moderna and the others I write about. So I'm taken with that theme. I think it's one that you can learn a lot from and hopefully readers enjoy it as well. Well, as one reader, I certainly have, Greg. And so keep on doing it. I didn't realize that I didn't notice that theme throughout. So now I will be noticing that when, if and when you do another one. Yeah, I didn't notice myself until I passed it in. But yeah, I love like that theme a little bit of a David and Goliath. But I think there were lessons that can be learned about overcoming obstacles and criticism even and skepticism from the ex the so-called experts. Greg Zuckerman author of the new book, A Shot to Save the World, The Inside Story of the Life or Death Race, or a COVID-19 vaccine. Thanks so much for joining us. Oh, great to be here. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Surgwer. We'll see you next time. Fed's latest decision on interest rates. FOMC officials per se hiking rates by another 75 basis points. Right now we're seeing markets really tiptoe in that Fed decision. All three major indices slightly in the red. Now, here's what else is on tap for this hour. Tuning into Paramount. Yowel finds out that Ali Canal has some instant analysis when earnings results at a Paramount, which was also whacked by a Wells Fargo downgrade earlier in the week. And swiping the plastic, I talk about Mastercard CEO Michael Mibach on why he doesn't see a cold-filled holiday shopping season. And CEO ChatFest will also check in with the CEO's XPO, Travago and Rockwell automation to get a pulse on the global economy in two-year-end. Brad, over to you. All right. Thanks so much. Big Fed day. We're going to get to the decision later on this afternoon. We're taking a look at how the major averages are moving on today's session going into that announcement. And then the press conference as well. You're seeing the Dow down by about four tenths of a percent. Let's set the mood with some candlesticks here and take a look at some of the larger movements that have been taking place there. So getting just another look at some of the other major averages here on the day. We'll try to get markets back later on. Oh, there they are. Okay. Well, anyway, we've moved on. We're going over to sectors right now. Sector's on the day. As we had seen some major lagers throughout the early morning session, we've now seen all 11 S&P 500 sectors in negative territory, moving to negative territory. Financials has also slipped into the red. That's flat but to the downside. Take a look as well at consumer discretionary as we've been tracking that. That's down by about three tenths of a percent. And with that in mind, want to take a look at some of the retail names as I've been tracking those. And you've got a lot of red in retail right now. Amazon hyperwalfling, Walmart, down half a percent, home depot down four tenths of a percent. And take a look at the declines and lows moving lower on the day by about one percent. Also, you've got a host of others just to put this in broader perspective here at some of the declines on the day. You've got of course bedbath and beyond as well. That's down by about one percent right now. Julie, what do you think you're very much bad? And we're also watching shares of Paramount that are down about nine percent after an earnings miss as investments in its content marketing and international expansions bite with a recap of the media giant's earnings and the broader streaming landscape. We've got our own alley canal joining us right now. So Ali, tell us about this quarter and what stands out and what happened. Yeah, welcome.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,52,2022-11-02 17:33:12
4659," We've got our own alley can out joining us right now. So Ali, tell us about this quarter and what stands out and what happened. Yeah, well, good morning, Julie. It's very clear investors are not too happy about this amiss on both the top and bottom lines. As you mentioned profits really suffered as a result of those greater investments in marketing content, international expansion, which Paramount has been really committed to week advertising revenue as well. That declined to percent the quarter. That's a big macroeconomic challenge at the industry as a whole has been grappling with that weight on the company's bottom line. CEO Bob Backish, though, he focused on the company's subscriber wins for the quarter. We did see a significant amount of growth Paramount plus adding 4.6 million subs for total of 46 million Pluto TV also seeing continued success with 72 million monthly active users. And as a whole, the company has nearly 67 million subscribers across its direct to consumer services. And executives said that there's more room to run here. The problem, though, that Wall Street seems to have is on the profit side. Can DTC alone save Paramount amid these linear TV challenges? We heard from Wells Fargo Steve K Hall earlier this week. He issued a second downgrade in less than a month on the stock. He suggested that Paramount take on the role of an arms dealer similar to what we've seen from Sony maybe license out of the company. He said that the company may be licensed out or sell off some of those assets. But back ish was specifically asked about the strategy on the earnings call. But he said that's not really part of their vision. He's really committed to keeping content on the platform. He says that's ultimately how you deliver value backish also confirming that price will be coming. He actually said this on our air during now finances all market is going to be on the market. So we're going to have to go over all though. Investors really struggling to find that silver lining shares seem to be accelerating their losses a bit down over 9.5%. Ali while we have you and we're zeroing in on the entertainment landscape. Netflix's ad supported tier that launching now to do we have a sense of where some of the conversations around where the what actual content will be on that ad tier right now this ad tier launching officially in the US tomorrow and the company did warn that about 5 to 10 percent of programming will not be available on this ad tier due to ongoing conversations surrounding the rights to air ads against some of this content. The Wall Street Journal confirming that those talks are still ongoing with several major studios and that includes some big guys are sitting on your screen now Disney NBC Universal Sony Disney's Ad Video. Some of these studios provide original content to Netflix. Others offer reruns, licensed their content. We're talking about some pretty big shows here. Graze in the crown you so it's very important that Netflix can get this right experts that I've spoken with have said advertising. Is the future for this company as it competes for subscribers and the revenue that comes along with that we have Disney's ad tier coming out next month. Many players So Netflix really trying to take a bite out of that market share, but in order to do that, you have to have the content of both the user side and the advertising side. So this is something that we will have to watch very closely. It says add tear rolls out. All right. Nobody let Penn bachelor know that he might not be on the ad supported tier. He might get upset. We know what happens then. Thank so much. Allie Canal. We appreciate it. Switching gears everyone. Investors saying it's a match as dating app specialist match group reported and earnings beat. The company which owns popular services including Tinder, Inge and match.com saw a boost in users and subscriptions in Tinder. That's even as a widening or weakening global economy threatens some of the spending here, particularly from its lower income consumers. But this is notable, especially given how the reopening would certainly thrust a lot of attention towards people who were just looking to get back out. And year over year, that was the construct. How much of the reopening in 2021 in Q3 back then would actually protrude or permeate over into 2022 and remain kind of this normalized level. I guess the only thing I can really add here is this love is not recession proof. I mean really if you've lost a job.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,53,2022-11-02 17:37:53
4660," protrude or permeate over into 2022 and remain kind of this normalized level. I guess the only thing I can really add here is this love is not recession proof. I mean really if you've lost a job recently you don't have money to go spend $200 on a day night. That's how I read this quarter. Yeah, I mean so the company, the last quarter was not great in terms of the earnings in particular and so this reminds me oddly of Intel a little bit where, where basically the company comes out and says we're going to be disciplined on headcount. We're going to be disciplined on expenses and that seems to be in this environment what the street wants to hear. These reassurances that these companies are reading the room so to speak and that they understand that we're going into a tricky time. So that seems to be the sort of big picture here of why match is reacting so well to this report. You wouldn't think that Intel and match would have much in common but that's the theme I see. I'm getting on. I don't think Tinder, I think there was weakness throughout this report. I think they highlighted that really through and through it. They lost customers in some parts of the business. Well for match, for bumble all of them are trying to build up the amount of revenue that they're seeing on each individual user by offering some of the incremental kind of add-on costs whether that's being able to move yourself to the top of somebody's queue, whether that's being able to say just send somebody a gift through the platform which to me is a little creepy. But if that's your, if that's your job, then that's your job. That's what I think. Yeah, I mean the paying users here is what it's going to continue to come down to where they're seeing that that paying user kind of increase. And I think it's really going to come back to as well the amount of word of mouth marketing that actually takes place among those paying users because if some paying users are saying you know what at the end of the day this is not really working for me anyway. Then you could see a deceleration. I mean there's also some internal stuff going on. There's no permanent CEO for Tinder right now. The CEO of that group left earlier in the year and they have not replaced them. And so this is something that they need to work on as well. So they're seeing the revenue strength. They're seeing still paying users keep up. But it's this sort of preparing for maybe things that are not going to be so rosy going down, coming down the pike. Indeed. All right. We're also watching electronic art shares. They're on the move. The video game maker is still confident that consumers will keep gaming despite economic headwinds for more our tech editor Dan Halley joins us. Dan, I think a lot of anticipation for electronic arts. I'm sure ahead of the World Cup they talked a little bit about this on the earnings call last night. Yeah. You know they so let's just go over the numbers real quick. They had missed on earnings per share and revenue and they had seen net bookings that were 100 1.75 billion that's compared with 1.85 billion in the year ago quarter. That is to kind of be expected after this huge explosion that we saw in the gaming industry throughout the pandemic. So there's going to be a drop. The bigger issue here I think for them is what they're expecting for the full fiscal year and they revised those numbers downward. They think that they're going to get between 2.79 and 2.8 billion. Sorry. The expected revenue was supposed to be 7.6 billion to 7.8 billion. It's down 50 million from what they had previously said and then total bookings they're expecting between 7.65 and 7.85 billion. That's down from the 7.9 and 8.1 billion. So they're expecting less spending. They're saying that that's a mix of things including the currency headwinds as well as people may be pulling back. They did yes with the World Cup. They had their largest launch ever for FIFA as far as FIFA 23 goes. They said they had 10.3 million players in its first week which is absolutely huge. They also have other franchises that are continuing to play. There's Apex Legends. People still like that. They did have their latest battlefield title come out which was who boy, absolute stinker. I mean it just was not good. It was broken right out of the gate and they're trying to fix that and you feel bad for the developers to put time into that. But I mean that's just not going anywhere. And going forward they do have some titles coming out. They have, it takes two coming out for the Nintendo Switch. That's more like a friendly like my wife and I would play. It's not something that's going to really drive sales. They have a new D for speed game coming out in December. Not going to be absolutely massive. They have a remake of the game Dead Space but that's coming in January.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,54,2022-11-02 17:41:51
4661," That's something that's going to really drive sales. They have a new D for speed game coming out in December. Not going to be absolutely massive. They have a remake of the game Dead Space, but that's coming in January. So there's some big games. Then you start going into further into 2023. And there's more titles there. There's a new Star Wars game. That tends to do well for them. But there's nothing that I'm really seeing on their upcoming games that really just like is going to knock my socks off. I think their company that they're so heavily reliant on their sports section. And look, people buy Madden every year. And I don't know why. It's a great game. I'm just confused why the stock is up. I think the numbers weren't that exciting. The mobile numbers seemed to be pretty pretty. Yeah, but the forecasts are kind of meh. I don't know. I think it's that the mobile numbers aren't as bad as they could have been. Competition as far as games, this holiday season, is going to be kind of light. The big one coming out is the new God of War game. That's a PlayStation exclusive though. So it's not going to hit on Xbox or anything anytime soon. But it probably is having to do it, the mobile aspect. And then it's not as bad as they thought it could be. But like I said, nothing really here that's going to knock my socks off as far as upcoming titles. It's just Activision Blizzard still has a lot. Take 2 still has. I mean, like Grand Theft Auto 5 is 8 million years old and it's still printing money for them. As you were running through the reception of some of those core titles that many of them being household names, I was looking at some data that came out yesterday, called the Duty Modern Warfare 2, has become the number one selling opening weekend ever in the franchise. $800 million through the first three days from its release on October 28th. With that in mind, what do we expect of this particular holiday season as we were just breaking down where the consumers might be starting to pull back in some spending categories as that, the same in gaming as well? I think gaming, there's always talk about, is it, obviously everything there's talk about, is it recession proof? I think with gaming in particular, the titles may be less to suffer the actual game sales. They are 60 bucks, so maybe people won't be buying as often. But there are sales that are just bonkers now. You wait a month after its title comes out and it goes from $70 to $20. So, I mean, sure that means that the companies aren't doing as well on margin there, but it does mean that the sales are going through. And then the bigger thing is what they have to offer as far as online play. And then that's where your net bookings come in. And that'll start to really blow up for people. I think for Activision Blizzard and Call of Duty, that's another title that just prints money for them. And they're going to have their online game that's, they have the multiplayer aspect going on, but they're going to have Modern Warzone 2, which really blew up at the high of the pandemic, or at the onset of the pandemic. This is the sequel to that. I still play it every Friday, get a couple of white claws and play with my friends. I'm going to keep doing that. So I'll be on there as well. But I think there are some titles that are going to continue to do well. Really, for a lot of companies, they look at the online games and they say, this is a continuing revenue stream. They look at the single-player games and they say, it's not really going to do as well. But then, honestly, on balance, you can look at some of these single-player games and say, oh, they blew everyone else out of the water. So I'm looking at God of War, Ragnarok, and thinking that that could be one of those games. Link up with me on Xbox. Damn, we can do some NBA jam. I can really get it. Baby, I've already got the SNES. We're always on fire. That's what we do. You know the man, gaming expert Dan Healey. Okay, before we go to break, we're watching shares of Disney off Paramounts. Really less than expected earnings. The fairies Tim Nolan is out reiterating an upper form rating on the stock. Head of Disney's November 8th earnings. Nolan thinks Disney plus his plays to show continued upside-down new subscriber additions and slowing operating losses. But he does voice a good bit of caution on the outlet for Disney's theme parks where attendance could be hit in 2023 if the US economy slips into a recession.

Foxconn said in the statement the plant will continue operating within a quote closed loop or self-contained bubble that limits contact with the outside world. There were reports remember over the weekend about workers fleeing the factory because of concerns that they would be then stuck there.

Dupont said all parties had received regulatory approvals for the merger except from that of China's state administrator for market regulation.

Rockwell automation shares down here after the company saw higher earnings and sales in the fourth quarter and issued a fiscal 2023 growth forecast. Let's bring in Rockwell automation chairman and CEO Blake Morett for more on this. Blake, always good to see you. Top of your earnings release. You know that organic sales in the fourth quarter up 20 and a half percent that's very big gain against a backdrop of a slowing economy. Where are those sales coming from? So we saw great sales in the fourth quarter. It was broad based and we serve a wide variety of industrial markets from automotive which had a very good quarter semi conduct.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,56,2022-11-02 17:50:34
4663," broad-based and we serve a wide variety of industrial markets from automotive, which had a very good quarter. Semiconductor, as we're participating in the build-down of capacity there, oil and gas, renewable energy with solar energy, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, a really broad-based across the spectrum. With that kind of broad-based results that you've seen, where do you look across the business and really identify where there is perhaps even still cost management that needs to take place at this point in time? Well, productivity is always a part of what we're doing. Even in a time like this when we're seeing double-digit growth, we saw, as you said, double-digit growth in the last fiscal year, particularly strong in the fourth quarter. And as we go forward into our fiscal year, 23 double-digit growth again, with strong earnings growth as well. Now productivity for us and for our customers always remains in style. A big part of our value proposition is increased efficiency in all of these industries as well as helping them launch new lines of business. And we look inward and look for ways to be efficient ourselves. Blake, I'm trying to figure out why your shares are down, frankly. And I don't know if it was the midpoint of the private forecast, maybe being a little light of what analysts were predicting. But I also see your free cash flow was lower than some of the folks on the street were predicting. And about $358 million. Can you talk to us about your cash position and how you guys are spending and we're saving right now? Sure. We're traditionally a very strong converter of a free cash flow. And one of the things that we see in an environment like this is an increase in our inventory, particularly components work in process. As we're managing through the supply chain constraints, bringing in largely semiconductor chips, they're arriving at different times. And so we're making sure that we're bringing in that inventory so that when that last chip arrives, then we're able to get products out the door and improve the customer service and reduce lead times to customers. The downside of that is that higher inventory is reflected in higher working capital, which has a negative impact on free cash flow. Blake, I mentioned before your organic sales and this four in the fourth quarter, you just completed up 20 and a half percent. But your outlook for the next 12 months, you see organic sales up 9% to 13%. How is this current quarter started? Current quarter has started in line with our expectations. So our quarter began October 1 and so far the quarter in terms of orders and shipments is developing in line with expectations. I want to also mention in an environment like this, there's continued volatility while we expect a gradual improvement in the supply chain and specifically around semiconductor availability for the types of node technologies that we use. We still believe a conservative approach is appropriate as we introduce guide for the year. I'm also curious about whether a conservative approach is warranted on things like headcount. I noticed in the statement, you talked about that you're committed to investing in attracting and retaining key talent. How are you thinking about workforce and headcount right now? Are you sort of holding the line on numbers but still focused on getting the best people in their house that work? Well, we always focus on getting the best people in and obviously making sure that we're an attractive destination for talent in all ways. In compensation is certainly a part of that, increase amounts of equity as a part of total rewards and all the other things that make rock roll a great place to work. With a continued low unemployment, then we recognize that talent, especially in some of the most high demand jobs, have a lot of choices. It's a fundamental part of our culture to consider all the other choices that an employee like a customer can go and to make sure that we match up really well.

Coming up, XPO has officially launched its spin-off RXO. We're going to speak to the New CEO of XPO. Let's come up next. I'm going to start off with a new one. XPO now an independent company after spinning off its truckload brokerage business RXO. And also we've got a new CEO for XPO. That's Mario Harrick and he is joining us now. Mario, full disclosure. You and I chatted a little bit last night at a reception at the NYSE following the formal spin-off here. And we of course have talked to Brad Jacobs who is now stepping down as the CEO of the company about the rationale behind what's going on. But just to take a step back, we have talked so much about the broader economic landscape. We've talked a lot about the build-up that we've seen in inventories and a lot of industries. What are you guys seeing across the country in terms of the flows of goods? We're really towards great seeing you and thanks for having me on. So we are seeing a softer macro this year than what we saw last year. And we're hearing mixed feedback from our customers. Today our less than truckload business is two-third industrial companies. And we're seeing some of these companies having more product flow through their supply chain. Until Yahoo! Finance live this Wednesday, November 2nd, we are moments away from the Fed's decision on interest rates, Wall Street widely expecting a 75 basis point hike. Let's take a look at how the markets are trading ahead of this decision. We have the Dow not too far from the flatline, still low in positive territory. Up though, just 24 points, S&P in the red off just around 3 tens of a percent. We are seeing some selling in the NAS Act.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,58,2022-11-02 17:59:18

We are seeing some selling in the NASDAQ. 106, the NASDAQ 100. That's off about 7 tens of a percent. Some pressure on some of those big techniques. We'll hear about more in just a couple of minutes here. Let's take a look at the bond market. You have the 10 year still in the red. We have the sector action as we head into this decision. Utilities and duchels, financials, health care, the only sectors holding onto gains this afternoon bringing up the rear wave consumer discretionary communication services and technology, the worst performers this afternoon. Michelle. All right. Well, you mentioned those US bond markets. Let's get you up to speed on what's been happening there as we're seeing as with the five year we're seeing that that's down about a third of a percent, the 10 year down about half a percent, the 30 year pulling back the most though down almost 1%. Now let's also take a look at what we're seeing with the two year because that's actually impacted the most by Fed policy expectations and also reflects sentiment about the outlook for the FEDFED funds rate as we take a look at the two year also under pressure here. So one will be keeping a close eye on Dave. Thank you. Michelle. So the next stock is ahead of this decision. Always the most sensitive area to Fed rate increases. Probably part of the reason they are down 31% year to date and part of the reason they are up just less than 2% over that powerful October versus what we saw in the Dow up 13% you see meta Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, alphabet all down on the day ahead of this decision from the Fed. Let's get more from Jen Schomburg ahead of the big decision from Jerome Powell. Jen. Rate hike the fellow reserve raising its short term benchmark interest rate by three quarters of percentage point to a new range of three and three quarters to four percent. Now the Fed laying the table for perhaps a slowdown on future rate hike saying in the statement that determining future rate hikes they will take into account the cumulative effect and the lag and monetary policy on the economy, inflation and financial developments. The Fed is expected to expect ongoing increases in the interest rate until it achieves a level that is, quote, sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back down to that 2% level. Now the Fed still views inflation as high and views the job market as strong, pointed to stop strong job gains in a low unemployment rate. This marks the fourth straight 75 basis point rate hike since June and unprecedented move for the fellow reserve, the Fed has been taking a lot of time to get to the end of the year. It started explicitly targeting the Fed funds rate back in the late 1980s. The vote was unanimous and while the Fed pulled another jumbo rate hike today, we will wait to hear from Fed Chair Powell on whether he will signal slower rate hikes ahead. We'll get more from him and less than 30 minutes time back to you. Jen, the rate hike this afternoon taking rates the highest level that we have. That's just a little bit more than 30 minutes. We'll see how the rate hike is going to be in the next few months. How is the language evolved from the last meeting because a lot of focus from the market perspective is what it's signaling when it comes to December and then out into 2023? Right. So as I mentioned John, the major change in the statement is that they seem to be setting the table for perhaps a slow down in the pace of rate hike. So we're going to determine the path forward for future rate hikes. They're going to take into account the cumulative impact of rate hikes that have already been done as well as that lag effect. Typically there's an 18 month lag effect when it comes to monetary policy. So they're going to take that into account as they look at the impact on the economy, inflation and financial developments. All right. A big thank you there to our very own Jen Sean Buggler. We'll be keeping an eye on you. Don't go ahead and see the next meeting. We'll be looking at the theme. The advices capital management partner and portfolio manager also joining Sarah House Wells-Fygo senior economists. And as we're already seeing the doubt up about 340 points just on that announcement, even though we knew obviously that this was expected. So John, what's your initial reaction to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,59,2022-11-02 18:03:57
4666," Seeing the doubt, about 340 points just on that announcement, even though we knew obviously that this was expected. So, John, what's your initial reaction to this? This was widely baked in at this point. Yeah, no surprise here. And very little changing in the statement that we've seen so far. Clearly, the big news will come with the press conference. I think there was some concession to and recognition of that growth is moderating. And I think that might suggest to the market that the end might be in sight for rate increases. We do expect another rate increase in December, potentially also in March. The Fed does have a really big challenge here trying to get this inflation under control. When there are so many factors that have contributed to it, from rising wages in the tight labor market, we saw some new data on that yesterday, and also from continuing shortages in various parts of the economy. So, the Fed has a hard problem. The market is finally recognizing that it's going to take some time to solve. But they now may be thinking, okay, next year may not be as bad as it could have been with rate increases, at least pedoring out. Sarah, what do you expect to hear from Jerome Powell? So, I expect that we'll still hear that he is utterly determined. She bring down inflation. But I think we'll also hear a little bit of a tone that we've seen in this statement here, and that we're getting to a point where we're at more of a crossroads when it comes to policy. The committee, of course, has already done tremendous tightening to date, so we're raising the Fed fund rate by 375 basis points in just eight months. But we need to take into account how much tightening has been done. So, there's a little bit more new on some thinking in the outlook. But I think it's important to remember that even as the Fed is signaling that it might be ready or might be in a place where it can begin to slow the pace of rate, I think that the committee is far from done for policy tightening. So, and when you take a look at the Dowser action right now, we're up just around 267 points. We wore up over 300 points just a minute to go. S&P in the Green Nasdaq, now back in positive territory, up just around four tenths of a percentth excitement that we're seeing from Wall Street. Is that a bit overdone at this point just given the uncertainty out there and the fact that the Fed is going to keep raising rates, it sounds like? You know, I think the Fed said something that really should have been obvious to everybody that sort of understands how they work is they made an explicit statement that they're going to take into account the cumulative tightening that has already taken place is when they gauge how much more tightening needs to happen. Now, and of course that there will be lags and they would take those lags into account before deciding whether to tighten any further. So, I mean, that should have been obvious to people, but I think that came as perhaps some reassurance to the market and remember where we are. I mean, the market, the S&P 500, the Dow, the Nasdaq certainly has already traded off significantly when you think about the rate increases that were signaled starting about a year ago. And I think investors, particularly long-term investors, are looking forward and they're saying, hey, stocks have become pretty inexpensive here. At some point, these rate increases are going to cease and in fact, we have more rate increases behind us than we have in front of us so that rate increase headwind, particularly to growth stocks, is now going to be tapering off at potentially reversing as we get into the second half of next year. So, it's a good time potentially to buy some stocks if you're a longer-term investor. And Sarah, we did see some of the balance sheet tightening start to slow in June. How much of an indicator, though, is that of how far away we might be from the Fed perhaps plateauing or at least pivoting at some point? So, I think we're still some ways in terms of reaching that terminal rate. So right now, our expectation is that we will continue to see the Fed hiking through probably the March meeting, but I think we have to also acknowledge that inflation is quite stubborn right now and so we're still expecting poor PC inflation to be running a little bit under 4% amulet through the first half of the year. And so, I think that's going to keep the Fed on guard when it comes to its policy stance. So still looking at a pretty tight stance of policy. And it's also not just about how far the Fed ultimately takes the Fed funds rate, but I think we also have to bear in mind how long the Fed will keep that policy rate at such an elevated height. And Joe, as important as this day is, it's hard not to look ahead to Thursday with the CPI number. That's next Thursday. If you're Jerome Powell, what can you point to if you want to say, all right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,60,2022-11-02 18:07:52
4667," or a target, you know, after they've now cleared out their inventories and stocked the right stuff, they could be real opportunities and we like those two stocks particularly. And then you have to look at the luxury brands. Some of them continuing to do well. You have to watch the inventory situation. But the high end consumer really isn't going to feel the pinch so much from this inflation. Gas, foods, a small proportion of their budget expenditure so that they're not going to be hurt that much. So really is a time to pick and choose where to go. Favorite the luxury consumer retail markets and really stay away from the mid range where folks are, you know, companies are likely to see us fall off in their traffic as folks go bargain, shopping at a place like TJ Maxx. All right. Joanne and Sarah stick around because we're going to be coming back to you in just a later on this half hour. Let's bring in Dennis Lockhart. He's a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta getting his take on the 75 basis point height that we just got from the Fed and Dennis. I want to start here because the Fed is laying out this possible rationale for a slowdown in the pace of rate. I'm saying that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range of committee is going to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lives with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. I know you were specifically watching the language here, the change that we could potentially hear from the Fed. What's your takeaway on that statement? Well, I'm not surprised at today's rate move. I think that was everybody expected that. I am a little surprised at the inclusion in the statement of language that gives some hint of what the path of policy might be. That's a little bit unusual. I think it's welcome because they're acknowledging that they're they're getting close to a restrictive point and at some stage will be looking a lot more tactically at whether to add further rate rises or to pause. They're signaling that they're getting into that zone and I think that's a good thing. Of course, they want to keep their options open as much as possible. So Dennis, based on that, another evidence you're taking into account, you expect 50 next month. If you're not going to pause in 23 or keep hiking. Depends on the data, of course, and we can't forget that. They're always going to be looking at the data and looking for for some signs of progress against the inflation problem. I think it's quite plausible that they stepped down to 50 next month. I would even say that's likely. And they have a meeting January 31st and February 1st and another meeting in March. I think it's a little early to project those rate hikes if they actually occur because it's going to depend on all the inflation reports and analysis they do between now and then. And Dennis, they did say they would take into account cumulative, cumulative tightening as well as some of the lags that people are concerned about in the real economy showing up. The thing is that they're keeping that in mind. And this was a unanimous decision. Are you surprised because we were hearing a little bit of dissent as to how far and how far the Fed should be going right now? Well, let's remember that the vote, the list of voters is a subset of the total committee. And so a unanimous decision on the 75 basis point increase doesn't necessarily reflect that there isn't a fairly robust debate during the meeting among those who think we should slow down and those who think they should they should keep at it. Perhaps raise 75 next meeting or even thereafter. So you just don't know what the discussion is. The minutes that come out in three weeks will give us a much better sense of that. But I'm not surprised that it was unanimous. I don't think anyone had a basis on which to dissent at this meeting. Dennis, two questions, Jerry. Even in this room before, I know we've asked you this in the past, but at this point in the economic cycle, when there's so much uncertainty, when we do have five inflation prints between now and the next Fed decision, what kind of conversations do you think are going on inside the Fed? And when you take a look at inflation right now, signs that they could potentially",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,61,2022-11-02 18:15:22
4668," between now and the next Fed decision. What kind of conversations do you think are going on inside the Fed? And when you take a look at inflation right now, signs that it could potentially be cooling. How confident are you that we will see significant cooling here in the coming months? Well, I tell you, I have been surprised at how persistent the inflation picture has been so far. I think it's very hard to conclude that inflation in any way is really broken to the downside, broken out to the downside. It is still a very troublesome picture when you take all of the different components into effect or into consideration. Your earlier speaker correctly said autos seem to be softening perhaps shelter and housing is softening but it's still a little bit early to draw that conclusion. I think they will be talking among themselves about messaging and that is if they decide to step down, how do they frame that decision exactly? And it's a little bit of a tricky communication problem, I think, for Jay Powell and for his colleagues. Earlier this week's BlackRock is out with the notes saying we think the Fed will only stop when the severe damage from rate hikes is clear to you fear severe damage and if so, where would we see it? I've been saying now for many weeks that the more persistent inflation is the greater the chances or probability of a recession simply because they have one crude tool that they're using. It doesn't address every root cause of inflation and if inflation continues they're going to be highly tempted to continue to use that tool. So the risk of overshooting or oversteering is very definitely there and I just think that you have to consider the possibility of a recession of some severity, I'm not sure what severity in 2023. And we know that Chair Powell had talked about pain for the US consumer for the everyday American with this. For people who are wondering what this means for their credit card bills, how should they be bracing themselves for this period? I spoke yesterday to someone from the retail industry who gave me a sense that the consumer is already adjusting to some extent and that most of the spending in this particular chain of stores is on essentials, not on discretionary items. And I think that's probably what's happening. The overall consumer numbers are holding up but the constitution of consumption is shifting to essentials and I think you're going to see particularly those at the lower end of the income spectrum doing that more and more and with more and more difficulty, frankly, if essentials continue to rise in price. This is your reaction to the market's reaction to this and I know you're more of an economy guy, not so much an equity person but when you take a look at the euphoria that we continue to see in the markets when the Fed is still saying that they're going to raise rates and just might not be as aggressive. Do you think a move like this is justified? Now we'll see if it holds for the next couple of market sessions but I think what you're seeing right now and then the Dow is up with 202 points. It's sort of a sigh of relief many rally after a lot of suspense building up. They're not so much suspense but let's say just building up to the decision and the announcement by the Fed and I think what the Fed has done today as well as said sort of confirms the expectations that were already priced into the market and the market is responding positively to having their expectations affirmed. The markets are walking through a desert surgeon for any hope that there might be water on the horizon aren't they Dennis Lockhart. Great to have you here sir appreciate that. Thank you. All right joining us now for a closer look at the bond market reaction.

4669," Great to have you here sir. Appreciate that. Thank you. All right, joining us now for a closer look at the bond market reaction. RJ Gallo, Federator, me's senior portfolio manager. Good to see you sir. Let's first get your reaction. We knew the 75 was coming. Anything inside the language surprise you in particular the mention of the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. Well, I thank you and all the prior guests who just spoke before me are focusing on the right things. That the addition of that language elevated the importance of the idea that when you get closer and closer to a destination you slow down just like when you're driving a car. And that's what they're telling us the the the the acknowledgement of the lags the cumulative tightening that's in the pipeline. The signal is clear they're getting closer to their pause. It'll probably be early to mid 2023 call it 475 or 5 and then they have to stop and wait to see the cumulative impact of the tightening the fact that the bond market is reacting with the steepening where two and five or yields or double digits richer. And that makes some sense. This new language I think for closes at least for now. The concern that they're going to keep going 75 and I think it affirms expectations that were built off of recent FOMC members speeches and appearances that this day was coming. This idea of slowing the pace and getting closer to the pause. When we're getting closer to a destination I'm looking down at my GPS and I'm seeing the time go down 10 minutes or so we're not seeing that in inflation. We're still at a 40 year high. What evidence in there is there that we are closer to the destination, which is 2% I'm going to stay with the car analogy. If you are going to drive your car by looking solely in your rearview mirror, you will hit a wall or another car. That's what the Fed would be doing if they looked solely at CPI and PCE realized past inflation while driving the car of monetary policy is the economy moves forward. They need to look forward and anticipate it's undeniably clear that monetary policy is not instantaneous mortgage rates have surged but other interest rate sensitive sectors are only now starting to feel the pain cumulative impact of a sharp and aggressive tightening that is already underway. They need to look through the windshield as to where the car is going. Lags take time to overcome. We cannot set policy solely on realized past inflation. The Fed is heartened by the way by the fact that inflation expectations are all pretty much south of 3% whether you look at tips or you look at surveys. They are acting in a manner that keeps those expectations relatively contained and they can't set policy solely on realized inflation. It's like driving a car looking solely in the rearview mirror. In terms of what we saw with Q3 real GDP, we know that the Fed is data dependent but with so many indicators pointing in different directions. What does this mean for not just the likelihood of a recession but how deep of a recession we might be headed for? Q3 GDP was an upside surprise propelled heavily by the surge in exports and the drop in imports. The post pandemic world has been dominated by heterogeneous reopenings, all kinds of distortions to global trade patterns. Who actually thinks exports are going to keep growing in a double digit rate? Very few people. The economy is slowing in China. The economy is likely going to be in a recession in Europe. Global growth is slowing. Our exports are not going to continue to expand that pace. If you ex out the impact of trade and government spending from the Q3 GDP release we just had, it was 0.1% at an annual rate, a seasonally adjusted annual rate, 0.1. That wasn't that strong of a GDP print. The underlying internals when you ex out traded particular as well as government spending are weaker. The midterms are coming up. Government spending is not going to be surprising to the upside when we have divided government with Republicans controlling perhaps the House and the Senate. Certainly the House.

The new language that that we've all been talking about is going to get questions from from the media that's assembled in the room there. They they're going to want to drill down for further meaning there. It's a challenge. The chairman Powell faces getting in front of them at any session, but he actually has a unique challenge now. This language, which I think was unanimous across all the voters, suggests that they're opening the doors of the pause. It's not right away, but they're getting close. We're getting close to our destination, as I said before. There's going to be a lot of questions about how the market should interpret that new language. Why was it put in there? Clearly the committee on a unanimous basis feels like it belongs there. Can Chairman Powell still sound hawkish on inflation while acknowledging the need for a pause and not open the door to a huge rally? Former President Law card mentioned earlier. It's a tough act. It's not an easy task to communicate such subtleties to the markets which often trade on soundbites. So there's a risk that he gets up there and tries to talk back or walk back the language in the statement. That seems like a low risk. I think he may elaborate on it in a way that will get further bullish response from potentially equities and from the intermediate part of the Treasury curve, for example. So then RJ, on behalf of investors, if you were in that room with Jay Powell, what would you want to ask him? Interestingly enough, I think that the bigger questions come down to quantitative tightening. The Fed's plans with respect to the balance sheet. They've made their pace of balance sheet reduction abundantly clear. But there's plenty of talk, including talk at the Treasury Department of the need to sort of bolster liquidity. Bond volatility both implied and realized volatility has been extraordinarily high this year and liquidity conditions have likely something to do with that. I'd be interested to see what Fed staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York working with the Treasury. What they're thinking about, what measures could be taken to allow the balance sheet to shrink to be consistent with the overall monetary tightening. But to do so in a way that might be less disruptive to the functioning of the marketplace. RJ, Galah, always great to have you. Federated her knees. A senior portfolio manager. Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. Let's kick it over to Jared Bickery. Is there closer look at some of those gains that we're seeing at least across the board when it comes to equity markets? Yes, and don't call it a pivot. Some great commentary there. And I'm going to delve deeper into this, but I just want to point out the Dow S&P 500 NASDAQ all in the green now, not the case earlier in the day. And I just want to go over some of the movements in the bond market. Here's a five year TNO yield. It is net down nine basis points. You're going to see everything down on their yield curve. Ten year TNO yield. That's down five basis points. And the 30 year on the long end down a little bit less, three basis points. The very short end down three basis points. You can see the 13 week. That tracks what the Fed benchmark is doing. The very short as end. And it has recovered somewhat. Also, the US dollar very important. That has taken a leg lower. But you got to think all of this was set up by that Timorouse article in the Wall Street Journal about two weeks ago. And there's a lot of pressure on Fed share Powell right now. Is he going to deliver what he doesn't want? Is that going to be a stock market rally? The Fed officials have been on record saying that's not what they want to see in this instance. So I have to agree with our prior, I guess. It's going to be a very difficult tight wire act for Jay Powell to navigate here. As he takes questions and isn't too bullish or optimistic, I guess we're going to have to apply the Goldilocks test with 2020 hindsight. Paradise. Has to be just right indeed. Jeroblicery, thank you so much. All right, well, as we wait comments from Fed share Jerome Powell, let's bring back to Anthony, advice as capital management partner and portfolio manager. And Sarah House Wells Fargo, senior economist. So Sarah, obviously we're seeing increased market reaction here. But obviously we're still waiting for the exact wording to come from Fed share Jerome Powell. Just how tough is this balancing act going to be in terms of the wording of this? Well, I think it's still going to be very tough because I think he's going to want to demonstrate that the committee is still very much committed to bringing inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,64,2022-11-02 18:28:18
4671," learning of this. I think it's still going to be very tough because I think he's going to want to demonstrate that the committee is still very much committed to bringing inflation down restoring inflation back towards its target, but also acknowledging the fact it's done a lot of tight need to date. It's time for things to slow, but they haven't given up on that inflation target. So as some of the prior guests mentioned, I think it's going to be difficult to make sure that the market maybe doesn't run away with that somewhat more dovish message than that has been signaling over the past few months, but balancing it with the fact that yes, there's been a lot of tightening to date. There's still a lot of work to do when it comes to inflation. And Joanne, perhaps Lloyd Blankfine, the former chairman of Goldman tweeted it best, I imagine Jay Powell and the rest of Fed governors are right now sitting with the Thessauris trying to find the right word that means pause or not pause depending on whose listening. So what's the language you'll be listening for? What's the Fed drinking game coffee, if you will? Is it data dependent? Yeah, you know, who knows what Thessauris they're using, but data dependent is a term I'm sure we will hear again. I think they will get into specifics to try to create that balance. One area is to be clear that house prices went up a lot, rents is up a lot. That's going to feed into keeping inflation on inflation. The labor market remains tight. They could cite the recent data on that. On the other hand, they are also likely to cite data that shows that the economy is slowing a bit, whether that comes from the liquidity constraints that we are starting to see pop up in corporate debt markets government debt markets. We're seeing credit spreads widened. We're seeing bid aspects wide in. So there's clearly liquidity constraint that should tamp down some of the economic growth that we've been seeing. They can cite that as the other side that their policies are having an effect, but that they need to do more that there's definitely more work to do given the pressure on wages given the housing data. And so I think they'll have enough data in their arsenal to be able to strike that balance. I think they'll try to emphasize right that they are data dependent and that looking at inflation in the past, you know, is only part of the data that they use. That they're doing a lot of observation of the economy in real time to gauge how much more work they have to do. And if you again, you look from an investing perspective, I think it's pretty clear there are fewer rate increases to come. Then we've had to date and that suggests a little bit of less of a headwind to stock valuations going forward from here. And I think that's partly what the market is reacting to. And so in addition to the inflation data, obviously the CPI prints and the five prints that we're going to be getting out between now and the next meeting is going to be a big focus. What else in addition to jobs will you be focusing on over the next four weeks. I think the same as you are spending in addition to just the labor market and inflation data. So we've seen weakness in business investment. You've seen weakness in residential investment. And as RJ was talking about, we can't see the strength and exports go on forever, but how the household sector does. How willing it is to spend down the savings, lean on its balance sheets. I think we'll be pivotal, pivotal for how long we can see the economy continue to expand and continue to put pressure on inflation. All right. There is the Fed chair Jerome Powell walking the podium. Let's listen. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. We have both the tools that we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 75 basis points and we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. Our policy stands purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%. In addition, we're continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price stability will likely require maintenance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,65,2022-11-02 18:32:39
4672," In addition, we're continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance of policy for some time. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year's rapid pace. Real GDP rose at a pace of 2.6% last quarter, but is unchanged so far this year. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year's rapid pace in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment. Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low. Job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month over August and September. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs, and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2%. Over the 12-month ending in September, total PCE prices rose 6.2%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.1%. And the recent inflation data again have come in higher than expected. Price pressures remained evident across a broad range of goods and services. Russia's war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food, and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, and as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, economic food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points. Continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. With today's action, we've raised interest rates by 3 and 3-quarters percentage points this year. We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions, and we are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest rates sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. That's why we say in our statement that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, we will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. At some point, as I've said in the last two press conferences, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,66,2022-11-02 18:36:53
4673," At some point, as I've said in the last two press conferences, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases, as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% goal. There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates. Even so, we still have some ways to go, and incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected. Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices in the longer run. The historical record caution strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Colby. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. On the need to slow the pace of rate increases at some point. Is a downshift contingent on a string of better inflation data specifically between now and let's say the December meeting? Is that something that the Fed could potentially proceed with independent of that data given the lag defects that you mentioned? So a couple of things on that. We do need to see inflation coming down decisively and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings. Of course that's what we'd all love to see. But that's, I've never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we're aiming for. We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% objective over the medium term. How will we know that we've reached that level? Well, we'll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened the effects of that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation. Taking into consideration lags, as I mentioned. We will be looking at real rates, for example, all across the yield curve and all other financial conditions. And as we make that assessment. Hi, Howard Schneider with with Reuters. Look, I'm sure there's going to be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you're going to slow in December or not. Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis point increase? So what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program if I may and hit to talk about the statement language along the way. So I think you can think about our tightening program has really addressing three questions. The first of which was and has been how fast to go. The second is how high to raise our policy rate and the third will be eventually how long to remain at a restrictive level. On the first question, how fast to tighten policy. It's been very important that we move expeditiously and we have clearly done so. We've moved three and three quarters percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero. It's a historically fast pace and that's certainly appropriate given the persistence and strength and inflation and the low level from which we started. So now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate. And we're saying that we'd raise that rate to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2% target over time. And we put that into our post-mating statement because that really does become the important.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,67,2022-11-02 18:41:19
4674, restrictive to bring inflation to our 2% target over time and we put that into our post meeting statement because that really does become the important question we think now is how far to go and I'll talk more about that. We think there's some ground to cover but before we meet that test and that's why we say that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate and as I mentioned incoming data between the meetings both the strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report do suggest to me that we may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting. That level is very uncertain though and I would say you know we're going to find it over time. Of course with the lags between policy and economic activity there's a lot of uncertainty so we note that in determining the pace of future increases we'll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with the monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. So I would say as we come closer to that level move more into restrictive territory the question of speed becomes less important than the second third questions and that's why I've said it the last two press conferences that at some point it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made it is likely we'll have a discussion about this at the next meeting a discussion. To be clear let me say again the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high deraise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted which really will be our principal focus. If I could follow up on that to what degree was there an importance or wait given to a need to signal this possibility now given all the concerns really around the globe about fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else you know dealing with their own stress as a result. Well I think I'm pleased that we have moved as fast as we have I don't think we've over tightened. I think there's very difficult to make a case that that our current level is too tight given that inflation still runs well above the federal funds rate. So I think that at this meeting I think the last two meetings as I've mentioned I've said that we that there would come a point and this was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might mean and we did discuss this and as I mentioned we'll discuss it again in December. But there's no I don't have any sense that we've over tightened or moved too fast. I think I think it's been good in a successful program we we we uh that we've gotten this far this fast remember though that that uh we we still think there's a need for ongoing rate increases and um we have some ground left to cover here and uh and and cover it we will. Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal chair Powell core BCE inflation on a three or six month annualized basis and on a 12 month basis has been running uh in the high fours close to 5% is there any reason to think you won't have to raise rates at least above that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down. So this is the question of disdison does the policy rate need need to get above the inflation rate and I would say they're range of views on that that's the classic Taylor principle view but I I would think you'd look more at a forward uh you know a forward looking um uh measure of of inflation to to to look at that but um I think the answer is we'll want to get the uh the policy rate to a level where it is where the where the real interest rate is positive. We will want to do that. I do not think of it as the as the single and only touchstone though. I think you put some weight on that you also put some weight on rates across the curve very few people borrow at the at the short end of the at the federal funds rate for example. So households and businesses if they're they're very you know meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them credit spread spreads are are larger so barring rates are significantly higher um and uh I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit so I would look at that as an important feature I put some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,68,2022-11-02 18:45:36
4675," are larger so barring rates are significantly higher. And I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit. So I would look at that as an important feature. I'd put some weight on it, but I wouldn't say it's something that is the single dominant thing to look at. If I could follow up, what is your best assessment or the staff's best assessment right now of the current rate of underlying inflation? I don't have a specific number for you there. There are many, many models that look at that. And I mean, one way to look at it is that it's a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs above that level, for sure, substantially above for some time, you'll see it move up. But the movement will be fairly gradual. So I think that's what the principal models would tend to say. But I wouldn't want to land on any one assessment. There are many different, as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation. Thank you. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Gina Smiley with New York Times. I wonder, do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is or is it risk of becoming entrenched? Is inflation becoming entrenched? So I guess I would start by pointing to expectations. So if we saw longer term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling. And they were moving up a little bit in the middle part of this year, and they've moved now back down. That's one piece of data. Shorter term inflation expectations moved up between the last meeting and this meeting. And we don't think those are as indicative, but they may be important in the wage setting process. There's a school of thought that believes that. So that's very concerning. I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have, we're now 18 months into this episode of high inflation. And we don't have a clearly identified scientific way of understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. And so the thing we need to do from a risk management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully, but thoughtfully, and get inflation under control, get it down to 2% get it behind us. That's what we really need to do, and what we're strongly committed to doing. Rachel. Hi, Terpowell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. The statement points to the lag times. I'm wondering if you can walk us through how you judge those lag effects, what that timeline looks like over the coming months or even a year, and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the economy. Yeah. So the way I would think about that is it's a commonly for a long time thought that monetary policy works with long and variable legs, and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity, and then perhaps later than that even on inflation. So that's been the thinking for a long time. There was an old literature that made those legs out to be fairly long. There's newer literature that says that they're shorter. And the truth is we don't have a lot of data of inflation of this high in what is now the minor economy. One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal funds rate, financial conditions would react, and then that would affect economic activity inflation. Now, financial conditions react well before in expectation of monetary policy. That's the way it is moved for a quarter of a century, in the direction of financial conditions, then monetary policy because the markets are thinking what is the central bank going to do. And there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before. We don't know that. I guess the thing I would say is it's highly uncertain. Highly uncertain. And so from risk management standpoint, we do need, it would be irresponsible not to ignore them, but you want to consider them, but not take them literally. So I think it's a very difficult place to be, but I would tend to be, want to be in the middle, looking carefully at what's actually happening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk management standpoint, remembering, of course, that if we were to over.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,69,2022-11-02 18:50:04
4676," It's actually happening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk management standpoint. Remembering, of course, that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy. Whereas if we don't get inflation under control because we know it's tight enough, now we're in a situation where inflation will become entrenched. And the cost, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially. So from a risk management standpoint, we want to be sure that we don't make the mistake of either failing to tighten enough or loosening policy too soon. And if I could follow up, should we interpret the addition to the statement to mean that more weight is put into those lag effects than they would have been after previous rate heights? So I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these ongoing rate heights and policy becomes more restrictive, it'll be appropriate now to be thinking more about lag. Of course, we think about the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy, but we will be thinking about them. But we won't be, I think we'll be considering them, but because it's appropriate to do so. Let me say this, it is very premature to be thinking about pausing. So when they hear lags, they think about a pausage. It's very premature, in my view, to think about or be talking about pausing our rate height. We have a ways to go. Our policy, we need ongoing rate heights to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive. And of course, we don't really know exactly where that is. We have a sense, and we'll write down in September, sorry, in the December meeting, a new summary of economic projections, which updates that. But I would expect us to continue to update it based on what we're seeing with incoming data. Thanks, Neil. Thanks, Chair Powell and Neil Irwin-Vaxios. As you look around the economy, the clearest impact of your tightening so far has been on pausing, maybe some venture fund attack companies. It's been relatively narrow in terms of labor market, consumer demand, a lot of sectors, you don't see a ton of effect. Is the pathway and channels through monetary policy works changing? Is it narrower than it used to be? And on housing in particular, are you at all worried that you're crimping housing supply in ways that might cause problems down the road? I don't know that the channels through which policy works have changed that much. I would say a big channel is the labor market and the labor market is very, very strong. And household, of course, have strong balance sheets. So we go into this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through many different things and also with households who have strong spending power built up. So it may take time. It may take resolve. It may take patience. It's likely to get inflation down. It may, I think you see from our forecast and others that it will take some time for inflation to come down. It'll take time, we think. So sorry, was that getting to your question there? Housing. Housing, the housing part of it. Yeah. We look at housing, of course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the global financial crisis. They're not historically high, but they're much higher than they've been. And you're seeing housing activity decline. You're seeing housing prices growing at a faster rate and in some parts of the country declining. You know, I would say housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic, as demand increased in rates were low. We all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was. Prices going up, many, many bidders, no conditions, that kind of thing. So the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. We're well aware of what's going on there. You know, from a financial stability standpoint, we didn't see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the global financial crisis. This credit was very carefully, much more carefully managed by the lenders. So it's a very different situation and doesn't present potential financial, doesn't appear to present financial stability issues. But no, we do understand that that's really where a very big effect of our policies is. Presentation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,70,2022-11-02 18:54:28
4677," But no, we do understand that that's really where a very big effect of our policies is. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Aguida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the labor market. You mentioned early on again that job openings are very high compared to available workers. And I'm just curious to what extent you do and don't draw a signal from that. So, for example, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to take up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings? What do you see? Are wages what's really important? How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation? So we talk a lot about vacancies and the vacancy to unemployed rate, but it's just one. It's just another data series. It's been, you know, unusually important in this cycle because it's been so out of line, but so has quits, so have wages. So we look at, you know, a very wide range of data on the labor market. So, you know, I'd start with unemployment, which is typically the single statistic you would look to is at a 50-year low, 3.5%. We're getting really nothing in labor supply now. We had, I think, very small increase this year, which we had really thought we thought we would get that back. Most analysts thought we would get some labor supply coming in. You mentioned wages. So I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture. It's true with average hourly earnings, you see. So I would call it a flattening out at a level that's well above the level that would be consistent over time with 2% inflation, you know, assuming a reasonable productivity. With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture. The headline number was a disappointment. Let's just say it was high. It didn't show a decline. There's some raise of light inside that, you know, that if you look at private sector workers, that did come down. The compensation did come down. But overall though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor market where demand substantially exceeds supply. Job creation still exceeds, you know, the sort of the level that would hold the market where it is. So that's a picture. Do we see, you know, we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is happening. You know, maybe that's there, but it's not obvious to me because wages aren't coming down. They're just moving sideways at an elevated level, both ECI and hourly earnings. We would love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down. vacancies are below their all time high, but you know, not by as much as we thought because, you know, the data series is volatile. We never take any one reading. We always look at, you know, two or three. So it's a mixed picture. I don't see the case for real softening just yet. But we look at, I guess I just, as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on labor market. So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation? You know, I think wages have an effect on inflation. And inflation has an effect on wages. I think that's always been the case. There's always a going back and forth. The question is, is that really elevated right now? I don't think so. I don't think wages are the principal story of why prices are going up. I don't think that. I also don't think that we see a wage price spiral. But again, it's not something you can, you know, once you see it, you're in trouble. So we don't want to see it. We want wages to go up. We just want them to go up at a level that's sustainable and consistent with 2% inflation. And, you know, we think we can, we do think that given the, you know, given the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as history would indicate through the unemployment channel. It can soften through job openings declining. We think there's, there's a room for that. But, you know, we won't know that. That'll be, that'll be discovered empirically. Thank you so much, Kayla Towsie from CNBC. Earlier last month, the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession if central banks didn't change course, the new UK Prime Minister warned of a profound economic crisis there.

4678," Central Banks didn't change course, the new UK Prime Minister warned of a profound economic crisis there. And I'm wondering how the Fed is weighing international developments in light of a very strong economy here in the U.S. that would seem to be bucking those trends. So, of course, we keep close tabs on economic developments and also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad. We're in very frequent contact with our foreign counterparts, both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central banks that we have and I have won this weekend with many, many central bankers. So, we're in touch with all of that. I guess it's clear a time, difficult time in the global economy. We're seeing very high inflation in Europe significantly because of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine. And we're seeing China's having issues with the zero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we're used to seeing. We're seeing, we see those difficulties, the strong dollar is a challenge for some countries. But, you know, we take all of that into account in our models. We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing. Here in the United States, we have a strong economy and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5%. Core PCE inflation, which is a really good indicator of what's going on for us, is the way we see it, is running at 5.1% on a 12-month basis. And sort of similar to that on a 36- and 9-month basis. So, we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation of a control. The world's not going to be better off if we fail to do that. That's a task we need to do. Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time. And the stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy for decades, hopefully. Even though it may be difficult to get it back, getting it back is something that provides value to the people we serve for the long run. If I could just follow up on that. Thank you. The Fed has acknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don't affect things like energy and food prices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas. And there are some of the biggest pain points for consumers. So, as you pursue the current path that you've outlined, is there a risk that some of those prices simply don't come down? So, we don't directly affect, for the most part, food and energy prices, but the demand channel does affect them just at the margin. The thing about the United States is that we also have strong, in many other jurisdictions, the principle problem really is energy. In the United States, we also have a demand issue. We've got an imbalance between demand and supply, which you see in many parts of the economy. So, our tools are well suited to work on that problem, and that's what we're doing. You're right, though. The price of oil is set globally, and it's not something we can affect. I think by the actions that we take, though, we help keep longer term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2% inflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high. I don't know. Hi, Chair Powell, Janelle Marty with Bloomberg. So, the Fed is facing two more ethics-related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from President Bostic and President Bullard speaking at a closed event. So, some senators, like Elizabeth Warren, are saying that this is a sign of greater ethics problems at the Fed. Could you talk about what this does to the public's trust in the bank, and what the Fed is doing to prevent this kind of behavior from becoming common? Sure. So, you're right. The public's trust is really the Fed's and any central bank's most important asset, and any time one of us, one of the policy makers, violates or fall short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust, and we take that very seriously. We do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,72,2022-11-02 19:03:00
4679," And anytime one of us, one of the policy makers, violates or fall short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust. And we take that very seriously, we do. So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday, actually, we had a committee discussion of the full committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that's set out in our existing rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications. And we've taken a number of steps and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are. I would say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running and actually was through that, that the problems with President Basis' disclosures were discovered when he filed his new disclosures. We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into disclosures and follows them and approves people's disclosures and also all of their trades. Any trade anyone has to make, who's covered, has to be approved pre-approved. And there's a lag. It has to be pre-approved 45 days before it happens. So there's no ability to game market. So it's a really good system. It worked here. And I think we all said to each other yesterday, actually yesterday morning, we recommitted to each other into this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems. Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending? I don't. So as you know, I referred the matter concerning President Bostic to the Inspector General. Once that happens, I don't discuss it with Inspector General with anybody. It's just the Inspector General has the ability to do investigations. We don't really have that. So that's what he's doing. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Earlier this year, you touted the three month bill yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100% explanatory power. And you said, quote, if it's inverted, that means the fed's going to cut, which means the economy is weak. That curve is only two basis points away from inversion now. So I'm wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened, particularly given that rates work with a leg? Well, so we do monitor the near term forward spread. You're right. And that's been our preferred measure. We think it, you know, just empirically it dominates the ones that people tend to look at, which is twos, tans, and things like that. So it's not inverted. And also you have to look at why things, you know, why the rate curve is doing what it's doing. It can be doing that because it affects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down. In this case, if you're in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that's going to affect the forward curve. So yes, we monitor it. You're right. And that's what I would say. If I could follow up, you also said several meetings ago that the risk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much. Is what you're trying to tell us today is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit? Well, what's happened is time has passed and we've raised interest rates by 375 basis points. I would not, I would not change a word in that statement though. I think until we get inflation down, you'll be hearing that from me. Again, if we overtighten and we don't want to, you know, we want to get this exactly right. But if we overtighten, then we have the ability with our tools which are powerful to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode, we can support economic activity strongly if that happens, if that's necessary. On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it's a year or two down the road and you're realizing inflation behaving the way it can, you're realizing you didn't actually get it. You have to go back in. By then, the risk really is that it has become entrenched in people's thinking and the record is that the employment costs, the cost to the people that we don't want to hurt, they go up with the passage of time. That's really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,73,2022-11-02 19:07:20
4680," And the record is that the employment costs, the cost to the people that we don't want to hurt, you know, they go up with the passage of time. That's really how I look at it. So that isn't going to change. What has changed though, you're right. We're farther along now. And I think as we're farther along, we're now focused on that, you know, what's the place, what's the level we need to get to rates. And you know, I don't know what we'll do when we get there, by the way. You know, it doesn't, we'll have to see. There's been no decision or discussion around exactly what steps we would take at that point. But the first thing is to find your way there. Thanks Chris. We're getting there. Thank you. Chris Ruggabur, an associated press. Just to go back to housing for a minute, you mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on housing. Home sales are down 25% in the past year and so forth. But none of this is really showing up as you know in the government's inflation measures. And as we go forward, private real-time data is clearly showing these hits to housing. Are you going to need to put a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there's overtightening going on? Or will you still focus as much on the more lagging government indicators? So this is an interesting subject. So I start by saying I guess that the measure that's in the CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases. And that makes sense actually because for that reason, that conceptually, that is that's sort of the right target for monetary policy. And the same thing is true for owners equivalent rent, which comes off of, it's a re-weighting of tenant rents. The private measures are of course good at picking up the, you know, at the margin, the new leases. And you know, they tell you a couple things. One thing is once you, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases, it was, it's very prosyclical. So rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did and now they're coming down faster. So what, but what you, the implication is that we, there are still as people, as, as, as non new leases roll over and become and expire, right? You still, there's still in the pipeline, there's still some significant rate increases coming. Okay, but at some point, once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you that what they're telling you is there will come a point at which, which rent inflation will start to come down, but that point is, is well out from where we are now. So we're well aware of that, of course, and we look at it. And we, you know, but I would say that in terms of what the right way to think about inflation really is to look at the, at the measure that we do look at, but, but considering that we also know that, that at some point, you'll see rents coming down. Great, and just a quick follow, it looks like stock and bond markets are reacting positively to your announcements so far. Is that something you would wanted to see is that a problem or what, how much that might affect your future policy to see this positive reaction? You know, we're not, we're not targeting any, anyone or two particular things. You know, our message should be, what I'm trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go. We have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive. And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step. And that's meant to put that question really as the important one now going forward. I've also said that we think that the level of rates that we, we estimated in September, the incoming data suggests that that's actually going to be higher. And that's been the pattern. I mean, I would have little confidence that the forecast, if we made a forecast today, if we were doing an SCP today, you know, the pattern has been that one after another, they go up and, you know, that'll end when it ends. But there's no sense that, that, you know, that inflation is, is coming down to just, if you look at the, I have a table of the, the last 12 months of 12 month readings. And there's really no pattern there. We're exactly where we were a year ago. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,74,2022-11-02 19:11:41
4681," If you look at the I have a table of the the last 12 months of 12 month readings and there's really no pattern there We're exactly where we were a year ago. So Okay, so I would also say It's premature to discuss pausing And it's not something that we're thinking about that's that's really not a conversation to be had now We have what we have a ways to go and the last thing I'll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done and to not making the mistake of Of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and Doing that too soon. So those I control those messages and and that's my job Edward Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. Thank you Chairman So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve is trying to do to get inflation back to the 2% target? You know in theory it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep spending Uh Even and so so I think those two things do tend to wage to sort of counter balance each other out It appears consumer spending is is still positive. It's at pretty modest growth levels It's not shrinking, but and you know people are and you know the banks that deal with retail customers And many retailers will tell you that the consumers are still buying and they're and they're still you know Uh, real they're they're they're fine. So I don't know how big the fiscal headwinds are and they haven't shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining spending So it must must have to do with the with the savings that people have What about the spending there's tens of billions yet to be spent? I mean from the inflation reduction act the American Rescue Plan chips act by parts and infrastructure bill Um, where how does that go and plan your thinking about the future? You know, it's um Demand is gonna have some support from those savings And also from the strong demand that's still in the labor market We still see pretty significant demand and and um a tightening labor market in some respects Although I think overall I would say it's not really tightening or or loosening So we see those things and what those things tell us is that you know our job Is going to require some resolve and some patience over time. We we're going to have to stick with this it's and and Um, you know, that's just we take we take all that as a given But we know what our objective is and we know what our tools can do and um That's how we think about it Hi chair pal Nancy Marshall Gensur from Marketplace I'm wondering has the window for a soft landing narrowed? Do you still think it's possible? Has the narrowed yes Is it still possible? Yes, uh, I think um, I we've always said it was going to be difficult But I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer it becomes harder to To see the path. It's it's narrowed. I would say the path is narrowed over the course of the last year really Um hard to say hard to say you know again, I would say that the Sort of array array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and to many economists um, there is a path to uh, there's your ordinary that there's a relationship to GP going down and uh, and vacancies uh, declining Translating into Unimplenit or there's Oaken's law so all those things are Relationships that are in the data and they're very real There's a little bit different this time though because you have this tremendously high level of vacancies and We think on a very steep part of the beverage curve All I would say is that that the The law the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated By those traditional measures because Uh, because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so strong Um, you know again, that's going to be something we discover empirically. I think No one knows whether there's going to be a recession or not and uh, if so how how bad that recession would be and um You know our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,75,2022-11-02 19:15:59
4682," That recession would be and our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time. And that's what we're going to do. Just real quickly, why do you feel like the window has narrowed? Because we haven't seen inflation coming down. The implication of inflation not coming down. What we would expect by now to have seen is that really as the supply side problems had resolved themselves. We would have expected goods inflation to come down by now, long since by now. And it really hasn't, although it's actually it has come down but it's not to the extent we had hoped. At the same time now you see services inflation, core services inflation moving up. And I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year without question. That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive. And that narrows the path to a soft landing, I would say. Thanks very much. Fed Chair Jay Powell just wrapping up his news conference after the central bank raised rates by 75 basis points for the fourth time in a row rates now. At the highest level that we have seen since 2008, but it was Powell's commentary that really sends stocks on a wild ride over the past 45 minutes or so. And we're trying to strike that both that dovish and hawkish tones going through some of those headlines as to why we saw equities bounce all over the place. The driving factor why we're in the red at this point with the Dow of 139 points of how saying that it's very premature to think about pausing rate hikes on pace for future rate hikes. He said that there are still ground to cover ongoing rate increases are appropriate at least at least at this time. He also said that the ultimate rate level will be higher than previously expected at the last September meeting and pairing that with that dovish tone to David was interesting because the market really wanted to hang on to anything that they could in terms of a dovish tone from pal. And we did see that we saw reflected in the market earlier this afternoon when pal did come out and say that he could potentially or the Fed could potentially pause rates at the December meeting. And so we're trying to figure out exactly which way the Fed is going to go. Yeah, again, the market says I said earlier kind of that guy walking through the desert just desperate for any drink of water. They took that one sip and raced up, but then pal reiterated not just once but twice again that word. He just said premature. It's premature to think about pausing and that's what really is the big picture takeaway and if there's two and I'll throw this one to you, Rochelle, he reiterated that again this was also twice and that's why it hit me that if we over tighten we have the tools to respond in the other case. We will entrench inflation expectations. That's what really gives you a sense of the direction moving forward for the Fed. We will say in this meeting we heard much more about the lag effects than we've heard in previous meetings. Obviously that's a concern that we've continued to hear from some economists and investors as well. And he talked about the three questions that are front of mind how fast they're moving. He said expeditiously, but he said that's less important than the other two questions which were how high and he said sufficiently restrictive to reach that 2% target over time with inflation. He said how long to remain at restrictive levels and he said that time may come that there may be discussion about it at the next meeting but then as we mentioned there, we also heard him saying look it's very premature to be thinking about pausing. So he was clearly trying to walk that fine line there, but as we saw from the market reaction, we did see the NASDAQ to negative first followed by the S&P but it's when he talked about it being very premature that we then saw the Dow also falling into negative territory as well. He talked about inflation being the possibility of it being entrenched. He said that there was no clear way of assessing that but as you mentioned it that he could use the tools from perhaps over tightening versus not doing enough and then having to keep going back and forth and allowing inflation to become entrenched. So he tried to walk that tight line, but as we see from the market reaction markets not not really on par there, definitely a lot more hawkish perhaps they were expecting sure enough. So it certainly looks like that. Michelle with the NASDAQ off nearly 2% right now. Okay, we want to bring in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,76,2022-11-02 19:20:19
4683," market's not really on par there. Definitely a lot more hawkish perhaps. They were expecting show now. It certainly looks like that. Rochelle with the Nasdaq off nearly 2% right now. Okay, we want to bring in the great hill of capital, a chairman. We have Thomas Hayes joining the show here to help us break down. What we just heard from Fed Chair Jay Palantin, you take a look at those headlines, trying to walk that very fine line, not trying to sound too hawkish, also didn't want to sound too dovish. Do you do a good job? A fair job. I think to Dave's point, it's equity bulls looking for a drink in the desert. He didn't give us much water, that's for sure. But he did leave on the table the possibility of a downshift in December from 75 to 50 or the next meeting. So the point is that the pace will be slowing at some point, even if the terminal rate is going to be higher. So we came into this meeting thinking the terminal rate might be about 4.6 to 5. Coming out of this, I do think that the downshift will be a positive thing. I think the markets will take 24 hours to digest this. And then we'll start to look company by company. But if you look at the seasonality that we're going into right now, we do have the election coming up. And that's coming up very, very shortly. The average return for the S&P in the 12 months following a midterm election is 18.6%. So he's trying to throw cold water on it. He has left the downshift. And he came out to the cumulative tightening. He's going to take that into account. He's going to take into account the lag. And then he completely threw cold water on it with the, it's premature to pause. So it's kind of double talk here. I think on balance, we've got two more CPI prints before the December meeting. We have the jobs report. Unfortunately, the Jelts report was a little hot yesterday. So we're not expecting miracles from the jobs report on Friday. 200,000 non-farm pay rolls. If it comes in hotter than that, market's going to price in 75 in December pretty quickly. If it comes in light, then maybe that downshift still is on the table. And there's no real indication that that CPI number on Thursday is going to be any better. We haven't seen, I mean, yes, use cars. We can see. He reiterated the labor market is a big problem. What else did we learn today that we didn't know an hour ago? Yeah. The labor market is definitely running hot. I mean, we were just talking about restaurants in Connecticut. You can't get a reservation at a good restaurant in Connecticut. So the economy continues to run hot. Labor market's hot. Inflation's hot. I know that there have been major speakers come out saying owners equivalent rent is miscalculated. It's going to take nine months to show up in the inflation numbers. We agree with that. The question is, is the Fed willing to wait and look through the windshield versus the rearview mirror? And right now, they're looking a lot through the rearview mirror and not maybe enough through the windshield. I think a good model to look at where we are right now is in 1948, post-World War II, when we borrowed a lot of money for the war to fight a visible enemy. Death to GDP got to 120%. They ran inflation above trend for about three to five years, three to five percent. And that ratio dropped from 120 down to 63 in just five years. So we might have to run inflation above trend. He did acknowledge long-term inflation expectations remain anchored. If you look at five-year inflation break-even, they're at 265. So they're getting close to the target. And Chair Powell has reiterated he's very concerned about expectations more than actual inflation. So so long as that long-term expectation stays anchored, we could start to see the downshifts that we've been looking for. If not in December, certainly in the following meeting. And as some investors are looking through the T-leaves here, we know that Jay Powell has asked about the three-month yields, talking about the inversion getting close, not there yet, though. And he did say that although it's his preferred measure, they are going to monitor it. But he did seem quite tight-lipped on that. What are your expectations about what the yield market is telling us? Well, you know, you initially saw bonds get bid on the news that they were going to actually pay attention to lagged effect of monetary policy. And by the time he finished the press conference, we were basically unchanged. The dollar sold off huge. Initially, when we saw, we're going to take into effect the cumulative tightening and we're going to take into effect the lags. Now the dollar is just off a little bit. So basically, we're unchanged here. But he came out way more hawkish in the press conference than...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,77,2022-11-02 19:24:42
4684," tightening and we're going to take into effect the lags. Now the dollar is just off a little bit. So basically we're unchanged here. He came out way more hawkish in the press conference than in the original statement. So the market didn't love that. But like all of these Fed meetings, what we usually find is the first move is often the wrong move. So give it a day to digest. I think as people say, it's very rare where we come to the table and we say the economy's strong. This is really bad news. What are we going to do about it? So I think it's a mix here. You know, if you look at earnings for this quarter, they're up 2.1%. They were expected to be up 2.8%. You back out energy. They were actually negative 0.6%. So he is destroying demand. If you look at the GDP for Q3 plus 2.7, if you back out the exports, which was a lot of energy and petroleum products, you actually had negative GDP. So their policy, they have to start to acknowledge that it is working on a lag basis. We started in March. You know, negative GDP, that in actuality, that would be the third negative GDP quarter. If you back out exports with earnings coming in slightly lower than expected. So these things are working on a lag basis. And the fact that he kept that downshift on the table, I think, is that drink of water in the desert, Dave. So what if we don't see that downshift, though, because there's already been criticism out there that the Fed has been way too hawkish up until this point. This was the fourth 75 basis point hike in a row. How did say he doesn't have a sense that the Fed has overtly and or that they have moved too fast? Are you at all concerned that they have been too aggressive up until this point? I do think when all of a sudden done, they'll find that they've been too aggressive and they'll have to pivot and actually start to cut sometime in 2023. If we've seen throughout history, it's always the case that they over tighten. The question is, how much they're going to look through the rearview mirror and how much they're going to look through the windshield. And right now, they're solely looking through the rearview mirror. And the reason the market initially rallied was that they said, OK, we will take into effect the lag basis, but then they discounted it completely. So I think when you look at the seasonality of the market, look, if the data comes in strong, it means the economy is strong. The market here at a multiple of 16.3 versus the 18.5 for the last 10 years, a lot of this bad news is priced in. The NASDAQ down 30%, S&P still down 18%. We have priced in a decent sized recession at this point, but stock selection and sector selection is going to be critical. You can't just say wholesale all in risk on. You really have to look case by case moving forward. OK, RJ Gallemey, the same reference. Look through the windshield and not the rearview mirror. Fine, you look through the windshield and tell me how they can even begin to consider pausing. Yeah, well, based on what data? Well, I think first and foremost, you look at commodities. They've completely rolled over since June. So that's going to be felt in the economy. You do see the GDP numbers. Basically, if you net out exports, you're looking at three consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. That's material. You look at earnings coming in lower than expected. You back out energy. You got negative earnings growth year on year. So this is only going to accelerate. So what would be nice is to see some back off in the CPI numbers, some of the inflation prints between now and December, to give them cover. They really need cover. They can't say we're going to predict that the CPI numbers are going to come down in six months. Therefore, we're going to pause. Give them something to hang their hat on, whether it doesn't appear that it's going to be the jobs report on Friday after the JALTS. But we've got four major prints between now and December. And maybe they don't downshift in December. Maybe it is the meeting afterwards. But he did effectively toggle and say, if not, December, then the meeting thereafter, in which case, people can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And the terminal rate, maybe it's not 4.6. Maybe it's 5. But so long as inflation expectations, the five-year break even stay anchored at 2.6, I think they'll be able to downshift sooner than everyone thinks, and certainly in the first quarter of next year.

He says the Fed is going to start talking about potentially slowing the pace of rate hikes at the next couple of meetings and we'll have a discussion with other Fed officials at the start of next meeting. Take a listen to the chairman. I would say as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed becomes less important than the second and third questions. And that's why I've said it the last two press conferences that at some point it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. The position has been made. It is likely we'll have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion. To be clear, let me say again, the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restrictive, which really will be our principal focus. And you heard Fed Chair-Powell saying that the pace of moderating rate hikes isn't as important as how high they could ultimately take. The Fed funds rate. He says the job is not done on inflation. In fact, inflation hasn't come down and it's pretty much where we were a year ago. He says it's premature to begin thinking about or talking about pausing rate hikes and that we still need to get to a sufficiently restrictive level on rate hikes. So he doesn't also think that we have over tightened, that the Fed has over tightened at this juncture. And again, the Fed raising rates by 3-quarters of a percentage point this afternoon to a new range of 3.75 to 4%. So Fed Chair-Powell standing hawkish at this juncture. That's certainly sounds hawkish and that certainly seems like what the markets believe at this point with the losses that we're seeing across the board, the S&P off just around 2% right now. Jen, what's up out to me with some of the commentary that he made on the labor market? Once again, reiterating that the labor market is extremely strong at this point, that demand far exceed supply. And then also consumer spending. When you said consumer spending, showing modest growth, fiscal headwinds haven't really restrained a spending up until this point and all that points to a more hawkish fed in the future. Yeah, I mean, certainly the Fed Chair believes that the job market does remain strong. You've pointed to another, a number of levels there. Notably that the unemployment rate remains low. The job gains continue, you saw the Jold's data, and so that really gives the Fed more room to raise rates without causing a deep recession. And he says that he and the Fed, other Fed officials are hopeful that cooling the labor market will not mean that we ultimately have layoffs, but more just fewer job openings in those sorts of junctures to try to bring down the level of tightness as opposed to an outright layoffs that would be akin to what you would have during a recession. Certainly, a ways to go with unemployment rate at a 50-year lower. Jen Chomburger, great job. Thanks so much. Well, there's plenty to come here on Yahoo Finance Live after the break.

4686,"boy Hehere so so so so so so The Federal Reserve announcing another 75 basis point rate hike today. But what does this hike mean for investors and their bond portfolio is joining us now to discuss as Alex Morris, FM Investments, President and Chief Investment Officer. He joins us as part of our weekly ETF report brought to you by Invest Go QQQ. So Alex, when you take a look at the reaction that we're seeing play out in the bond markets, yields on the 10-year treasury moving to the upside once again right now at 410, what's your takeaway guess from what we just heard from Palom? What does this mean to your foreign investors? Well, I think the Chairman makes a good point. We're not going to have a crystal ball. I read the statement before coming here and everything looked fine until the press release happens and I think it's pretty clear rates are going higher and they're going to stay there for a while longer. And long term, I think the Fed is making clear they will get a handle on things. So things will come back to normal. It's just going to take a while. And that's more or less what we should expect. These things don't happen on a dime and when they do, we all get very nervous and overly excited. So then Alex, for retail investors who are wondering how they should be approaching treasuries right now, talk about the ETF and some of the ways that they can get into this, perhaps if they're a little bit risk of us. Sure. So first of all, we built the ETFs because investing in treasuries is a tried and true strategy, but yet remains stubbornly difficult for most investors, retail advisors and otherwise. They trade in fractions, they have messy cash flows. They're not as simple to trade as stocks for a variety of reasons. And we built these single security, single treasury ETFs to make that much easier. Folks start looking at the yield curve and they start looking at all the various issues and it becomes very complicated very quickly. So as you start to look at how do you want to approach this, you want something as security of a treasury, but you don't want to make a mistake in how you invested it. So we built access to the most liquid, most straightforward treasuries today, which are the on the runs. These who are really looking for short term havens really should look at something on the shorter end of the curve, which is for us the 90 day product. And those who want to take a much longer term view on the economy and where the Fed ultimately land things should look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,80,2022-11-02 19:37:53
4687," on the shorter end of the curve, which is for us the 90 day product. And those who want to take a much longer term view on the economy and where the Fed will ultimately land things should look towards the farther end of the curve, which for us is in the 10 year product. So, you take a look at demand right now for these funds, what we're seeing playing out, given the fact that it is such an uncertain environment. I guess when people are second guessing what they should be doing, when it comes to investing in treasuries, what's one or two things you would advise them to take into consideration? First thing we tell everyone is this to show pass, right? So, not to fall off an long-term asset allocation or long-term game plan. Yeah, timing the market never really works terribly well. But if you're more worried about short-term movements, stay on the shorter end of the curve, continue to remain invested, but don't think this is the opportunity to try to outrun the market. You won't be successful, and if you do, it'll probably catch up to you pretty quickly. And Alex, you said that treasuries, a quote, finally interesting again. Talk about this period that way and give us some context given how we've historically seen the market move. Sure. So, for the last little pre-2008 treasuries had a long history of being somewhat elevated. Then all of a sudden, we entered a decade of zero interest rates, which is something that hadn't really been seen or thought of before. And many investors have gotten used to relatively low-cost capital that can fuel all sorts of things in the bond market in new and interesting ways, as well as the equity markets, which we certainly saw in the past decade. Now as rates go up, and we look backwards, you know, 20 years ago, rates were higher than this, and certainly in the 80s substantially higher. So now, as we move rates up to try to destroy some demand, as Chairman Powell made very clear, now we have to decide how do we get access to yield, as well as have some negative correlation, at least historically, to the equity markets. Traditionally, that's been treasuries. Certainly, credit spreads have started to widen, but haven't cracked yet, which is still a good sign for the bond market. But for those who have been risk on, and now we're looking for a safe haven, treasuries have traditionally been that location to go to, and we built products to make that easy to access. Access certainly important, especially for retail investors trying to get a hand-blown all these movements. Alex Morris, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, coming up, Paramount is generating a lot of bonds on Wall Street today, but that's not a good thing. We'll tell you why shares are falling, thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,81,2022-11-02 19:42:09
4688,". Now 18 months into this episode of High Inflation, we don't have a clearly identified scientific way of understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. And so the thing we need to do from a risk management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation under control, get it down to 2% get it behind us. That's what we really need to do and what we're strongly committed to doing. That's fair, Jay Powell is saying it's premature to talk about pausing the rate hikes here. We're seeing that reflected in the markets this afternoon, which is about 18 minutes to go until the closing bell. You're looking at the Dow, all 348 points, Nasdaq, the worst performer of the three meter averages, off just around 2.7% J.R. Blickrey as a closer look at the big board. Some of the selling that we're seeing as a result of what we just heard from Powell. That's right. It's let's go through some of the market movements here. I think it was instructive to view what happened first, and then what happened next at 2 p.m. We got a bullish tilt to the markets and that's based on expectations that the Fed might eventually, I guess, pair back the blistering pace of rate hikes. But Powell put a quick end to that early on in the presser. And you got to think that the Fed is actually doing its job here. The Fed doesn't want to see stocks higher on a day when it's contemplating or at least signalling that it might back off the rate of rate hikes here. And that's what we're getting. So the S&P 500 down 2%, I'm going to go through some other markets here. Volatility is up. You can see the VIX. Well, the VIX is actually net down from that time period. And so that's pretty interesting. Gonna make a note of that. Five-year T-note yield did drop on that announcement. And then it basically came back to the entry point. And then the 10-year T-note. It's actually higher based on the 2 p.m. print that we got. And finally, here's the 13-week T-build rate that tricks tracks closely what the Fed's short term to Fed funds market is doing right now. Now, the US dollar index ended higher as well. So all of this is signalling that there might be some more risk aversion in the markets. Although we're getting a conflicting picture here between yields in the dollar. I think we're going to see that sorted out over the next 24 hours. Also want to show you what's happening in Bitcoin because this would be the Supreme irony. If Bitcoin actually led the way, it didn't fully participate up to the upside. Wasn't as up as much as some of the equities and now it is given those back. So Bitcoin for telling the future that maybe we have to wait a few more announcements before we're going to get that final pivot that everybody's been expecting. That would be some irony right there. Let me just close with some of the sector actions and heat maps that we're looking at. Everything in the red right now is talking about the hit that we're taking to yields. Normally that would benefit some of the mega caps, but not today. We're seeing consumer discretionary tech and also communication services down more than 2%. So again, it's probably too early to parse out what these movements quite mean. Going to take another day or so, but in the meantime, stocks are down. Maybe Chair Paul did his job. I guess so. Even energy down 2.2%. Wow, good stuff. Chair Blickrey, appreciate that. All right, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, addressing the state of the housing market in the wake of today's interest rate hike. The housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. We're well aware of what's going on there. From a financial stability standpoint, we didn't see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the global financial crisis. Housing credit was very carefully.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,82,2022-11-02 19:46:16
4689," Point we didn't see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the global financial crisis. Housing credit was very carefully, much more carefully managed by the lenders. So it's a very different situation and doesn't present potential financial, doesn't appear to present financial stability issues. Rising mortgage rates have soured housing demand recently but there is some good news that a glimmer today if you will with the 30 year fixed falling a bit to 7.06% from 7.16 a week ago. That's according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Now rates are still near two decade highs and we also saw applications decreasing for the sixth straight week. Now lenders and other companies in the industry are reeling amid the broader slowdown. CNBC reporting Wells Fargo was processing about 18,000 retail loans early in the quarter down almost 90% from a year earlier. And mortgage staff at the bank are bracing for layoffs. It's not just the big lenders. Open door. A home flipping company announcing layoffs of 18% of its employees that amounts to roughly 550 people. And the stock is down 4.5% on the news and extending losses in the wake of the Fed decision. Now look, when we bake in the 75 point hike and the fact that it is again premature to think about pausing, you got a factor 30 year fixed driving up at least a quarter of a point. They're going to continue to go up and the housing market will continue to slow in resale. That probably is going to cost thousands of jobs in the mortgage industry. And you reference that CNBC article. Obviously when you have this slowdown, think of where we were during the pandemic field boom in the housing market. It was just a matter of time when you now see the downside of that. You're also seeing the higher mortgage rates. And so they're obviously far off their peak. And we know that they began cutting workers in April Wells Fargo did. And so a lot of people, some of the sources mentioned in the article there saying that some of these though have been a mix of some voluntary bankers sort of seeing the writing on the wall and moving on to other positions. So kind of clouding the picture as to how much of this has been voluntary versus how much of these layoffs had to be done. Now we know that last month, CFO, Mike, Santa, Massimo told analysts that we expect it to remain challenging in the near term. It's possible we have a further decline in mortgage banking revenue in the Q4 when originations are seasonally slower. So certainly bad timing on top of everything else. But obviously a very tough time there. And a lot of people at Wells Fargo concerned about job security. Yeah, I don't think this comes as a huge surprise given the massive slow down that we've seen in the industry. We've been talking to a number of guests about what we are seeing play out in the mortgage industry specifically and how challenging it's likely going to be over the coming quarters given the fact what we just heard from J Pal today that he is going to remain hawkish or it's still premature to talk about pausing rates or even any sort of pivot. So certainly it's going to be a tough time ahead. There was a recent dead out from black night saying that just 133,000 US homeowners at this point can save money by refinancing at today's rates. And that's sound date from a peak of over 19 million in late 2020. So really see that really just illustrates how dramatically this industry has changed over the last year and a half or two years from the peak of the pandemic to this really this. I don't want to call it a bus that almost seems a little bit too aggressive at this point, but a significant slowing that we are seeing play out in the mortgage industry and layoffs as a result. And pal said they're looking for some softening in the labor market. If they're looking really hard, they should look at the mortgage industry. That's where you'll see the beginning of some cracks in the labor market coming up electronic arts voicing optimism following its latest earnings much of it.

4690,"?! It's time for a triple play, the three stocks that we're watching in the last 10 minutes of trading. We've got MoneyGram, Paramount and Electronic Arts on deck. Now my pick is person-to-person payment service MoneyGram. The company debuting a feature allowing US consumers to trade and store Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin via its mobile app. Now the company joins others attempting to bring real-world cryptocurrency and blockchain use cases to life for everyday consumers. In a statement, Alex Holmes, MoneyGram's chairman and CEO said, Cryptocurrencies are additive to everything we're doing at MoneyGram. MoneyGram enables instant access to over 120 currencies around the globe and we see crypto and digital currencies as another input and output option. Now this isn't MoneyGram's first foray into crypto, but it's moving more conservatively this time with just a few more established crypto tokens. Its previous partnership with Ripple came to an end last May after Ripple got sued by the SEC in December of 2020. Of course Coinbase recently joined a number of groups in arguing that the SEC's case threatens the broader industry, so still a lot of volatility to be had here, but MoneyGram though it's still pressing ahead here, Sean. There are pressing ahead. It's not doing a lot for the stock today though. When you take a look at the market, at the reaction, although obviously there's a bigger macro picture going on. In today's market action, but certainly if you take a look at the stock down just a fraction here, so not a lot of excitement. I think potentially MoneyGram's move here, you can make the argument that it could BBB step forward into making Bitcoin cryptocurrency taking that mainstream, giving access to more and more users in terms of that. There was a recent Deloitte survey saying that there certainly is appetite out there for users to be able to get access to cryptocurrencies and use that as part of their transaction. Three quarters of retailers plan to accept either cryptocurrency or stablecoin payments within the next few years. Three quarters, 75 percent. That number stuck out to me because I thought it was a bit high when you think about how many transactions are actually done with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies today. My pick today is Paramount. It's a top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance. Look at that losses of just over 12 percent shares are sinking after revenue missed of Wall Street estimates. A number of headwinds facing the company, including the rise of cord cutting and a slow down in the advertising market. Now sales from its TV media segment falling 5 percent from the previous quarter to 4.9 billion. An advertising revenue dropping 3 percent to 1.9 billion. Paramount plus was a highlight for the quarter though.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,84,2022-11-02 19:55:10
4691," mint falling 5% from the previous quarter to 4.9 billion. An advertising revenue dropping 3% to 1.9 billion. Paramount Plus was a highlight for the quarter, though. 4.6 million new subscribers were added. That was actually better than what the street was looking for. What many analysts were anticipating, bringing its total to 46 million customers. Dave comparing that to larger competitors. Obviously, just a fraction of subscribers, but they are headed in the right direction. They are variety. They're reporting some layoffs coming as they consolidate with showtime. Some positives coming to Paramount Plus. You've got top-gun and smile coming to the format by the end of the year. And of course, that Walmart Plus subscription half price. That includes a free Paramount Plus subscription system catalyst there. My play is EA Electronic Arts. Shares up on its latest earnings report. Despite a post-pandemic pullback in gaming and currency headwinds, EA did beat on revenue and EPS. The company touting a record-breaking launch of FIFA 23 with over 10.3 million players within the first week, signaling the biggest launch period ever in EA sports FIFA franchise history. They added this year's title. It's been played in more than 200 nations worldwide. The CEO Andrew Wilson sang the entire global football community across our ecosystem will benefit from the unique holiday timing of the World Cup. And that's because of the change of the schedule because of the heat in Qatar. It's now just 18 days away, by the way. They did lower their annual bookings forecast between 7.65 and 7.85 billion from 7.9 to 8.1 billion. Overall, the gaming market is expected to grow just 2% in 2022. So you're really seeing some shrink in there. Earlier this week, EA also announced a three-game deal with Marvel, which will start with an Ironman game, the stock up. But just about 2% wasn't much higher, but like the rest of the market pulled back a bit down about 4% your to date for show. I mean, I will say you couldn't have asked for better time if you thought that EA, FIFA, and the World Cup. You want to talk about a match made in heaven. I'm super excited for the World Cup. You will hear me talking about it constantly. So yes, a boon there, obviously. Someone even on Twitter challenged me to a FIFA match. Well, I was like, I don't even play a game. I'm going to take them up on it. But oh, you don't play. I've got to try. I don't even play. But I might just out of spite. All right. I'm very excited for the World Cup to getting underway very, very soon. All right, well, coming up next, we are counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. We'll be right back. All right, yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,85,2022-11-02 19:59:44
4692," Uncle All right. Let us take a few minutes away from the closing bell on this Wednesday Fed, delicious liquor here to break down the MarkACon action. What are we seeing, sir? A lot of reds, so maybe the Fed is doing its job if it doesn't like to see green markets on Fed day who says to say Nasdaq down over three percent, so it was a rustle 2000. I'm going to show you inside the Nasdaq 100 Mega Caps taking it on the chin here, Apple down more than 3 percent. So is Microsoft Alphabet, Tesla down 5 percent, Amazon for Meta 4, Costco 3 percent, and the list goes on and let's take a look at the sector action to see what's going on. These are the tech heavy and mega cap heavy sectors that we see down here. Utilities the least dirty shirt in the laundry basket. That's still off 9, 10th of a percent followed by financials and health care. So all in all, not the best banner day for equities. We'll have to see what happens tomorrow. But here is our leader in sentiment index, not index, but markets. We see Kweb that's a Chinese internet ETF. You can say divorce from the current day. Other than that, it has been a week day for a lot of these fringe market. Let's take a look at the travel sector. And we are here for the closing though. Stocks ending the day in the red. As we wrap up the trading action, post Fed share, J-Pow's, press are there and look at those losses ending at the lows of the day, the Dow of 500 and six points. S&P off just around two and a half percent. NASDAQ, the biggest laggard here in today's action, off just nearly three and a half percent. A lot of those rate sensitive stocks, many of them tied to the tech sector, leading today's sell off. And the market's really focused on the fact that Fed share, J-Pow, saying that it is too premature to think about causing rates saying that there is still plenty of ground to cover ongoing rate increases seem appropriate at this point. So let's talk about what this means for the markets going forward. For that, we want to bring in Sam Stovall. He's CFRA's research, chief investment strategist. And we also have Michael Kushma, Morgan Stanley, investment management, chief investment officer, broad markets, fixed income. Sam, let me start with you. I guess just your reaction to what we heard from Fed share, J-Pow, and the selling that we saw as a result. Well, Shona, I guess I'm not too surprised because the Fed has been telling us for a while that it does not want to make the same mistakes that it did back in the 1970s. It doesn't want to end up pausing or even pivoting before they know that inflation is under control. And we've also seen over the last week several reports, whether it's Q3 GDP, construction spending, or the expectations for Friday's jobs report, that the Fed still is engaged in an uphill battle with inflation. And Michael, we are from previous analysts. They commented that the markets were just a little bit too enthusiastic about what they thought they were going to hear from J-Pow. And as we see from the sell-off that we saw today, that seemed to be the case. What is it that they are missing when it comes to this picture right now? Well, I think that J-Pow said something along these lines. And it's press conference today. There's three elements to monetary policy. How fast, how high, how long. And we had even gotten to that, including how fast they were going to go. Only today that is really start talking about, yes, at some point we're talking about slowing down. So not even yet finished with phase one, which then is, well, how high do we have to go? So they're not even clear about all high they have to go. And then they're certainly not clear how long they will have to stay. I did think the emphasis on not wanting to, they want to take into account the long lags on monetary policy does suggest, at some point, they will slow down because the monetary tightening so far will impact the economy. But it's premature to talk about slowing down yet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,86,2022-11-02 20:04:11
4693," slow down because the monetary so far will impact the economy, but it's premature to talk about slowing down yet. So to Michael's point, Sam, how high do you have to go? Do you think we're talking about a Fed funds rate around five? And do you factor in hikes through March? Yeah, Jared. I think we're going to see the Fed funds rate right now. Our target is between five and five and a quarter. And the Fed is suspect to being raised over the coming months. Where our belief is that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points in December. And then we'll engage in another 50 basis points in the February time frame. So the Fed's not done yet. And I think it's going to be in the fives before we hit a terminal rate. Sam, right about the risk then of the Fed going way too far. I know Paul saying at least up until the Fed, we're going to be able to keep the state of tightening too much. But if in fact we do see another 75 followed by another 50, where does that look? Well, I think that even from the very start, a, at least a mild recession was something that investors had to anticipate. Any time that the year on year percent change in headline CPI exceeded 6% going back to the late 1940s. We ended up with a bear market and a lot of the time that the Fed had been going back to the end of the year. And so the Fed ended up being deeper and lasting longer than average bear markets without recessions. So just the fact that the Fed was already 750 basis points behind the curve, meaning that normally Fed funds rate is higher than the year on your CPI number at the start of rate tightening programs. But this time around, the things were reversed by that 750 basis points. And so by earning on the more hawkish side with these comments, how should investors be thinking about this period between now and the next Fed meeting? I think it's as the Fed has said multiple times they've given up on forward guidance. The world is too uncertain. We don't know what's going to happen. So it's very data dependent. We'll have to see the flow of data. However, in order to be more confident about the inflate and improvement between now and December, you don't have a lot of months, a lot of times. Even if we get a better inflation print this month and early December before the next Fed meeting, it might well not be enough. It may be enough to keep them at 50. But to go less than it, I think it's it's not not feasible at all. So 50 is sort of the is the minimum next month. But going forward in 2023, it does become extremely data dependent right now. The momentum in the US economy is bit on the upswing. And job growth is slowing, but at a fairly slow pace, such that the unemployment rate is likely to stay low. So again, the danger if they prematurely slow the pace of ease of tightening and then move maybe to easing too soon, become. You'll just reaccelerate again and there'll be in a worse position at the end of next year. Well, I think you have to continue defense investing from a defensive perspective. Looking at my momentum model, basically it is the old standby of staples, health care utilities, and also to energy. And whereas you want to be avoiding those groups that tend to get hurt the most by rising rates, which would be your growth areas, communication services, technology, real estate. So right now it's, you know, playing it close to the best with defensive sectors is probably the best way to go. Sam Stovar and Michael Kushner there. Thank you so much for joining us on this Fed date with your market breakdown. Dave. Thanks for sharing our earnings alert here. Qualcomm has now reported Dan Halley is here to break down the numbers. You can see shares moving to the downside about 7% after hours. Dan, what do we see? The revenue they came at at 11.39 they expected was 11.4. So you can, you know, kind of round up there and they're meeting it. But as far as adjusted EPS, they missed. They came at $3.11 for its expectations of 3.13.

4694, a miss they came in at three dollars eleven cents for its expectations of three thirteen but the big deal here is for the next quarter their q one they have expectations for adjusted eps of two twenty five to two forty five the expectation though from wall street was for them to announce three dollars and forty cents that's a big difference so that's why we're starting to see or potentially why we're starting to see that stock price start to slip now down around five percent and part of that has to do with the smartphone market now we're seeing weakness there as far as people not necessarily needing or wanting to go out and buy smartphones making these big kind of pricey purchases when the economy is you know we're hearing so much about a potential recession and I think that seeps down to the the average consumer and so they they kind of pull back on that kind of spending especially on something like a smartphone where look if the one in your pocket works you don't necessarily need a new one it's more of a luxury buy when you don't have those kinds of issues so I do think that that's probably something that we're going to continue to talk about obviously apple it had a lighter quarter than expected for their iPhone sales so that's a you know a pretty good indicator of how the rest of the industry is doing especially since you know it's apple hopefully we get a read on if that apple relationship is going to continue longer than we originally thought which could certainly help Dan howley thank you good stuff there with Qualcomm earnings all right Roku has now released third quarter earnings after the Bell Yahoo fanatcis alley canal has those numbers for us and look at that stock alley down 20% after hours it's it's pretty stunning and it was an interesting story after the market closed after we've got these earnings because it's surged and then it came way down so let's break down with investors initially reacted to we had it beat on revenue 761.4 million versus the expected 702.35 million also a narrower adjusted loss per share of 80 cents versus the expected dollar 22 so beat there on both the top and bottom lines also a beat on active account growth but here's the bad news and that's what's driving down the stock by more than 20% it's their guidance the company now sees fourth quarter adjusted ebitel loss at about 135 million versus the expected loss of 45.5 million so that's a huge discrepancy that Wall Street is reacting to net revenue guidance for the fourth quarter also lower 800 million versus 897 million expected and we're just getting news as well that Roku CFO Steve Loudon plans to leave the company in 2023 so this is just a lot of information for investors to digest in the earnings release the company said quote as we enter the holiday season we expect the macro environment to further pressure consumer discretionary spend and degrade advertising budgets now advertising is what's been talked about with a lot of these tech companies especially following the results of meta snap alphabet the state of digital advertising largely in question amid a lot of these macro economic challenges so a lot of near term headwinds for this company they have been spending pretty aggressively they did say they were going to cut back on head count but right now investors not too happy there was shares down more than 20 percent in after hours quite the sell-off indeed a big thank you there to our very own alley canal I will stay with us coming up we're taking a closer look at Qualcomm earnings the stock sliding on that weak guidance as you can see they're off more than 6% stay with us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,88,2022-11-02 20:12:26
4695," secrets of the glamour of artists. Let's take a look at Robinhood. Their earnings report just released. You can see shares up just around 2.7 percent of beat up both the top and bottom lines here for Robinhood sales. Coming in, 361 million. The estimate was for 355.2 million. And there were loss than expected as well, loss of 20 cents. The estimate was for loss of as much as 31 cents transaction based on revenue coming in 208 million. That was short of what the street was expecting. Though crypto revenue also coming in a bit like their 51 million estimate out there was for 56 million monthly active users totaling 12.2 million. That was a bit lighter than what the street was hoping to see at 13.7 million. Average revenue per user coming in a $63 estimate out there was for 62.58. So a better reading on there than what we had initially anticipated from the street. But the beat's on both the top and bottom line specifically what we're seeing in revenue 361 million. Better than what the street was looking for a 358 million. That's a big reason why shares are up just over 2 percent in after we're straighting. Michelle. And while a different story for Qualcomm moving down was there, you see them more than 7 percent. That's after reporting forthcult results. We have Christopher Roland joining us. Tuscquoana International Group Senior Equity Analyst to really break this down for us. So as you dive into this earnings report here, what was it that you think was really the problem? Yeah, there are a confluence of headwinds that they're now experiencing. So they at the same time as seeing a rapid deterioration in demand. They've also seen supply constraints ease for most of their competitors. So this has resulted in elevated channel inventories that are now going to take multiple quarters to fully get through. How did the guidance look? The guidance was dreadful, truthfully. So we're looking at about 9.6 billion versus estimates of 12 billion. So this is probably the worst Qualcomm guide. I remember in multiple years here, they also lowered their overall outlook for total handset volumes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,89,2022-11-02 20:16:56
4696," I remember in multiple years here, they also lowered their overall outlook for total handset volumes from they were previously at mid-single digit declines. They're now at low double digit declines for the calendar year. So pretty dreadful. Chris, going into this earnings report, you had 165 price target and neutral rating on the stock. You said that this is the worst guidance that we had seen in quite some time. So what does that mean for just in terms of what we could potentially see over the coming quarters? And are you changing your rating because of this? Yeah, our rating right now is neutral. We downgraded shares last year on a bigger, broader, semi-s downgrade for the entire industry because we were worried about this. We were worried about overshipping. Four-qual-com, this is a fantastic company that is reinventing themselves. We're going to take a fresh look at this after we have these reset, this reset overall. But Qualcomm over the next few quarters is going to have to work through this inventory. And if we get line of sight into clearance on that inventory side, we would get perhaps more aggressive. And Christopher, in terms of where you see the growth story coming in terms of what's going to be driving growth for Polkham, especially after this earnings report, where do you see the opportunities? Yeah, their biggest opportunity is going to be automotive. They recently, this quarter, held a automotive day and they have some significant opportunities. For example, ADAS and autonomous driving, that will be a very, very big push for them overall as they continue to diversify outside of just handsets. But in handsets, 5G is not done yet globally. India is just starting to ramp 5G, for example. That'll be a new opportunity for them as well. And then they're moving into RF components as well to compete with guys like Skyworks and Corvo on that side of the handset as well. So we view that as opportunity for them entirely. This is Duckarty Down 37% year today. We were expecting or are expecting some news on that relationship with Apple and how long it may be extended. What do you expect there? Yeah, if you hear anything, let me know. But the expectation right now is that the internal modem development program in Apple is taking longer. They are going to need at least another year here. And so Qualcomm right now is in the cat bird seat in terms of negotiations. They will likely be able to negotiate nice prices for their modem and their 5G modem and content into that phone for at least another year. But we'll see where they go from there. Chris, we're going to get the earnings call underway very shortly. I guess what's the number one thing you want to hear from management? I know guidance is your big focus here. This large slump that they are expecting to see in terms of the smartphone industry. But what's the number one thing you're hoping to hear? Yeah. Number one is going to be this handset slump that we're in. What ining are we in? How much of this shortfall here was actually true demand versus inventory digestion? How long is this inventory digestion going to take? And when might we get to the other side of it? Is this a one or two quarter event or is this going to last well into the second half of next year? These are the things that are important for me. All right, we're looking forward to hearing you back. After that, Chris, Verol and SIG appreciate that. Sir, thank you. Let's have another earnings alert. Now he shares of Etsy are moving well up, almost 10% on their Q3 earnings. Yahoo, finances, Ali Garfingle here with the numbers. Ali, what do we see him? Great to see you, Dave. So we're getting some good news out of tech today. Etsy's popping on that Gross Merch sales beat. It came in at $3 billion as opposed to the expected $2.9 billion. We also saw a revenue beat, Dave. $5.540, about $600 million as opposed to the $563.6 million expected. We did see a loss per share at $7.62. And there were slight misses right on active fires, active, s-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,90,2022-11-02 20:21:11
4697," 600 million as opposed to the 563.6 million expected. We did see a loss per share at 762 and there were slight misses right on active fires, active sellers, but it's that Q4 revenue guidance day. We've seen so many revenue guidance misses for Q4, but Etsy's coming in within the range between 700 and 780 million as opposed to the expected 744.6 million. So good news out of Etsy today. We'll see if they can keep it up. Yeah, you talked about another company that desperately needed that good new. Been beat down down 58% year to date put up. Double figures now on that news. Great stuff, Ali Garfengal. Appreciate that. Coming up right here. Shares of Roku have slid by roughly 75% year's date. See what Wall Street expects from the streaming platform for the rest of the year. Next. And then a broader market sell off, Dine Brands ending the day modestly higher after reporting better than expected third quarter results. Yeah, the finances Brian Sosie sat down with the CEO of Dine Brands, John Payton, to discuss the key to its brand success in the past quarter. Take a listen. We had a really good quarter. Applebee's had its seventh consecutive same-store sales growth. IHOP had its sixth consecutive same-store sales growth. Average weekly sales for both brands is now equal to exceeding 2019. And that's because our brands are trusted and well-known by our guests. You know, and tough times like this, people flock to brands that they that they trust. And Applebee's and IHOP are about great value. They always have been and that's couldn't be more important than it is right now. There's nothing like taking a bad day of work and just having eight pancakes, John. I mean, why not? Those multi-grain pancups, pancakes that I hopper my jam, but take us through each brand. What are you working on without?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,91,2022-11-02 20:25:37
4698," There's nothing like taking a bad day of work and just having eight pancakes, John. I mean, why not? Those multi-growing pancakes that I offer my jam. But take us through each brand. What are you working on with Applebees? So Applebees is focusing on its core menu, really great marketing innovation. So this summer, for example, they partnered with Top Gun and they partnered with Fandango. And so for every $25 you spent at Applebees, you could earn a free ticket to Top Gun. And so Applebees does really creative marketing like that. I think that the best television in the business, they really focus on the nostalgic music. And this is a time where they're really attracting their guests. And they're also very focused on promotions right now, really rich promotions. So at Applebees, it's 12 shrimp for a buck with a steak. Wow. And 12 shrimp for a dollar with a steak. And that's the kind of value-edited promotion that our guests need right now. That's really good. It's tough times. So you mentioned tough times in that type of promotion. Is that, have you seen sales slow down because of a promotion like that? Or what made you run that? We run promotions like that because we know, right, with the inflationally it is and the cost of living, particularly for our guests. It is a tough time right now. So our brands have been through this before. They're both positioned as, you know, value-oriented brands in their category. And they know what's needed at times like this. So that promotion for Applebees, IHOP has just finished up two by two by two, which is two pancakes, two proteins and two eggs for five bucks. And both of those promotions drove traffic, which is why we had quarter of a quarter of Sam's to our sales growth. Is the environment so tough that you're going to have to continue these promotions into the holiday season? The environment is tough, right? And so, you know, we really lean into the love that people have for our brands. And the promotions, the promotions, you know, will continue. But I should also say that we're working on things that drive the longer term, right? So at the same time, we're very focused on our consumer and how they're feeling right now. You know, IHOP just launched its loyalty program, you know, the International Bank of Pancakes, which is, we're clever, right? You can earn pancoins and you redeem them in the stack market. And so, you know, we launched that program in April and we've already enrolled 3.5 million people. And that's a million more than we thought we would do at this time, which really speaks to, you know, the power of the brand and the need for loyalty, you know, and that's the way we're really needing it to grow in the brand. If you're running promotions like that, does that mean you've seen a peak in inflation? Yeah, there's good news here. So through the first half of the year, the cost of goods, food and goods into our restaurants was up about 22% in the first half of the year. The back half of the year, Applebee's will be more like 14, 15%, and IHOP is just down a couple of points because eggs and wheat, which drives pancakes, are still very high. So you know, we think it's going to allow our franchisees to, you know, to start to edge back toward more historical price increases, which are about 2 or 3% a year versus the 7 to 11% that they took in 2022. Is finding workers still a challenge? Good news there as well. So for the last four or five quarters, we were about stuck at about 90% of what we would consider full staffing. And in the last couple of months, it's 92, 93%. And we're finding that even the hard to fill jobs are getting more applicants like cooks in the kitchen. And so we're moving from recruiting to, it's all about retention now. And our franchisees are getting very creative to make sure that they retain their new team members. They're offering signing bonuses, retention bonuses, recruiting bonuses. They're extending 401k to a broader portion of their team members to wish in reimbursement. So it's all about keeping the people they've got. I don't want to get too wonky on this, but we've usually talked to the team at Chipotle and they've started to put in robots into their kitchens. Do you see a place in your restaurants with them? We do. Right? So we talked about staffing. And we're assuming that maybe 92%, 93% is the new normal. And at the same time, we need to help our restaurants become more productive, particularly as costs grow as well. So we're looking at, we're testing a robot in one of our IHOPs that can serve food and then to flip pancakes. We've all got their symbols applied, right? Are there any centers that you can see for the completion of найд gradient education of urban Germany?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,92,2022-11-02 20:29:55
4699," Outsc grow as well. So we're looking at, we're testing a robot in one of our eye hops that can serve food and then to flip pancakes. And to not yet, but that's coming and take the dishes back. It's like a little R2-D2 and guess love it, right? Because it's clever, but it makes servers more efficient. We're looking at robotics in the kitchen, you know, about for fryers to automate frying and things like that. As well as server tablets. For, you know, we've got server tablets at 500 of our Applebees, which makes servers more efficient. They turn more tables. They earn more tips. And so automation in robotics is a big part of having our restaurants be more efficient in the future. When does Applebees get back to opening up restaurants? So Applebees just finished last year a purposeful and deliberate three year refinement of the brand. We closed about 300 restaurants that were, you know, where the market moved away from them and they run profitable. So now we've got a core of about 1600 restaurants that are, you know, in great markets are profitable and are super strong. And so, you know, we envision transitioning to net growth starting in next year or early, early 24. And I hop too. I hop is a real success story. So we're going to open 50 plus restaurants this year. And that's during, you know, a time when the cost of constructing a restaurant has really become more expensive. So our franchisees are leaning into I hop because of the success we've had in their belief of it in the future. Thanks to Brian, Sasi and Dymarins, a CEO, John Payton. And they were interesting stuff there because he was very optimistic in terms of what we could expect here from the company going forward. But certainly a number of headwinds and what he said about labor really highlights what's going on on so many levels in terms of the trend that we're seeing play out in the economy and the inability or tough time that so many companies are having getting people through their doors. For usual, we are aligned on our interpretation of the interview. Yeah, it's in a fascinating dynamic in the restaurant industry right now. He's talking about retention. They used to have recruitment bonuses. Now they have retention bonuses. They're talking about tuition reimbursement. I've talked to a number of restaurant tours that have already built and are ready to go with beautiful restaurants. They are hiring recruitment firms, Richelle, just to try to staff restaurants and you have a lot of power if you are that employee, if you can manage a restaurant to go in and call your own shot and raise your wages. It's a really bad dynamic if you're John, but if you are looking for a job in the restaurant industry, now is the time. I mean, it's been a tough dynamic because you can go to restaurants around the DC, Maryland area and you just can't get a table because there just isn't the staff thing. So it's good to see them investing on that front. Otherwise, very interesting that that 12 shrimp for a dollar, if you buy a steak, I mean, people are looking for a good deal. So clearly, try to make everyone happy. They try to make the work is happy. And of course, clearly the customers as well. So yeah, we're really interesting interview there. Let's talk a little bit more about some good deals that you could potentially get because we have been focusing on this inflation story so closely, especially today in the aftermath of the Fed decision as many food giants and grocery stores raise prices. One is doing just the opposite for Thanksgiving. Aldi is going to match 2019 prices for holiday staples. Starting today, prices will be cut 30% from where they are. Now, in Rochelle, this news coming at a time when it is needed for so many Americans, Turkey costs are projected to rise. 23% this year, Wells Fargo saying that the overall cost of a Thanksgiving basket is going to cost 14.9%, basically 15% more than it did a year ago. So the fact that Aldi is coming out offering these prices is saying that what we've seen just around three years ago certainly a move that is welcome from so many of their customers. And we know that the avian flu obviously took a toll on the Turkey population, which then in turn is driving up prices. Now, this Thanksgiving price rewind promotion as they're calling it. It's not just on your turkeys. Your appetizers, desserts, sides, beverages, all discounted up to 30%. Now, Aldi is a brand that's very well known in most parts of Europe. But no, not a lot of people we were discussing this earlier, haven't ever stopped it, Aldi, before. So perhaps a good chance to sort of get in the door there once you see prices discounted this much. Yeah, they're a private company. That's how they can do that. They don't have to worry about shareholders, right? But, you know, Gen Z, the popular trend right now that you're seeing, of course, where else on TikTok.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,93,2022-11-02 20:34:11
4700," Yeah, there are private companies. That's how they can do that. They don't have to worry about shareholders, right? But, you know, Gen Z, the popular trend right now that you're seeing, of course, where else on TikTok is they're saying it's pizza for Thanksgiving dinner. They're looking to save a few bucks and back to what John Wise told Brian Sasi, Food Inflation at 22% in the first half, down, still up, but down to 14%, 15% in the second half. So at least a little bit of good news on the Food Inflation. I'm relieved and we got a ways to go there. All right, coming up next, shares of broke lunging in Accenture Trading, following the earnings that we just got. We've got endless reaction. We'll come back.

4701," I always had very tough competition. So it's always kind of been swimming with the sharks, if you think about it that way. The good news for Roku and everyone you just mentioned is that you're seeing all these linear television at dollars move online. You see Netflix with a 699 advertising supported service coming out. So it isn't that the challenge right now is that the money isn't moving online fast enough. And what you're seeing for Roku is the scatter market's kind of drying up. So the short term advertising market for Roku's the challenge. Tom, going back to what you just said there just in terms of the advertising market here clearly a massive challenge in the letter to shareholder Roku saying that we expect these conditions to be temporary, but it is difficult to predict when they will stabilize or rebound any insight or prediction just in terms of when you see this picture potentially improving for Roku. So two things, one, I had at one point thought that political advertising on Hulu on Roku or things of that nature could kind of be a stopgap. But clearly that's not the case. Number two, I think you've pointed the early days of the pandemic, digital advertising went negative in April of 2020. And then once we realized the economy was in better shape than we thought it was in, digital advertising rebounded pretty significantly. So I think at this point in time, when will we have the same conditions, when will we start thinking that the economy's headed the right direction? And that's when I think the digital advertising dollars are returned. And that's when things will improve for Roku. Hopefully that'll be sometime in 23. So there's the win and there's the what is the catalyst, Tom? I know they're selling now smart home products in Walmart. It's got an app with iCloud video recording. How significant is that? Or what else is there that would be the catalyst? That is very significant. So the only challenge for Roku there is if you think about the profitability of the hardware, I've got a TCL Roku TV behind me, a Roku soundbar, things of that nature. Generally speaking, they're selling the hardware at break even. And they make most of their money on the advertising front or on their just their operating system for smart TVs. So I think it's encouraging that they have the brand to extend essentially in the smart home. But that won't be a huge needle mover from a profitability standpoint. Really needs to the advertising research in there to try for profits. So Tom, what's the monetizing story of Roku? The monetizing story is that you have this tremendous opportunity viewership for OTT now is ahead of broadcast TV. It's ahead of cable television. But the advertising spend is still skewed toward linear television, that as that moves over time toward over the top, that's a tremendous opportunity for Roku and for others. And I think that's why I'm still bullish here despite the near-term headwinds. And I'm Steve Loudon, ZFO of Roku leaving the company's Ben with Roku, Ben CFO there since 2015. Roku without Loudon involved. Any concern to you? Hi, Steve's been an excellent CFO. But if you looked at the hires, actually, they made intracorder, they're getting a lot of high priced and high quality talent to come to Roku to advance the programming efforts to advance the proprietary content. So I'll certainly miss working with Steve. I think it's a great opportunity for the next CFO. But the good news is that they're still getting great executives to join. Despite as you pointed out earlier, that the stock's down 75% year to date. You know, I've known their 17% plus here in extended trading. All right, Tom Forte, I always great to have you. Thanks so much for reacting to these earnings release here with us. All right, coming up next, a new index revealing which city is a top emerging housing market in the US? The mayor of that city tells us what makes his town so desirable next.HAEL",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,95,2022-11-02 20:42:51
4702,"ikum The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com collaborate on the emerging housing markets index, which considers battle and return on real estate investment, economic health and quality of life. And with the population just over 70,000 Johnson City Tennessee came out on top. Johnson City Mayor Joe Wise with us now on the economy and the housing market. And good to see you Mr. Mayor in the obvious question is the wagon wheel song by Darius Rucker or number one on the Wall Street Journal emerging markets list. What was a bigger deal there in Johnson City? Well, we've had more time to think about the wagon wheel song, but we certainly find the both to be exciting references, I suppose. Mayor, what do you attribute all this excitement to the fact that people are coming from all over the country? It sounds like having interest in your relatively small city. What's driving that? I think there are number of factors that have contributed to it. You've as a city made a sustained investment in infrastructure and particularly the deployment of direct fiber to every residents and business in our community to provide 10 gig in and it. So that makes it a place that people can work remotely in a time when people are contemplating working remotely. But then alongside of those things are quality of life considerations that were home to East Tennessee State University that offers doctoral programs of medicine, pharmacy and nursing and physical therapy and many other allied and health science fields. And so with that comes the parallel medical community with the local children's hospital at level one trauma center. And so folks can come to Johnson City and find in a relatively modest sized town the resources, the services and the quality of life features and amenities that you might associate with significantly larger cities than Johnson City. Mary, we just had the average price, the median home price in your city up on the screen. 309,000 that's up from.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,96,2022-11-02 20:47:35
4703," significantly larger cities than Johnson City. Yeah, Mary, we just had the average price, the median home price in your city up on the screen. Now, 379,000 that's up from 350,000 just three months ago, up significantly. On a year over year basis, what do you make of the dynamics that's playing out in the housing market in your city? What we could potentially see to prices here in the coming quarters. Well, that's something we're mindful of. Every good news has some consequences that may not always be favorable. And so we're aware of the potential risk to affordability and potentially the concerns around the quality of life that might be changed if we had a significant influx. And so as a community and as a city, we're making very deliberate efforts to look at growth management and making sure that when when all the dust settles, the things that made Johnson City desirable as a place to live remain true of Johnson City for those who live here now and those who might live here in the future. How did the pandemic actually boost the economy boost the real estate of your town? Well, I think remote work, you know, we began the process of deploying the 10 gig internet through our local energy authority years ago before we knew there would be a pandemic in 2020. And so really we were ready in a capacity for remote workers, particularly long before the culture had an inclination to really be pursuing it the way we've seen over the last several years. And once people returned to office, how do you make sure people stay and don't leave Johnson City? Well, I think part of that is proximity. We're at the crossroads of interstates 26 and 81. We are within about a days drive of virtually everybody in the eastern half of the United States. And so for a lot of professionals, a community like Johnson City provides them the best of both worlds, we're only a few hours from places like Charlotte or Nashville or Atlanta. And so if your job doesn't require you to physically be in a specific location Monday to Friday, which lots of people's jobs do not, this might just be the right fit. Based upon the video I'm seeing sir, I have got to come visit Johnson City Tennessee mayor Joe Wise will be our guest that we will we will come see it. Thanks for being with us. All right, Sean, let's take a look at what's trending after hours. I'm going to take the trip with you. Those pictures look nice, didn't they? Let's do a road show in Johnson City. I like it. I like it. I like it. I'm very proud of all the producers. All right. Let's take a look at some of these after our removers here. We have Roku Qualcomm Etsy booking and Robinhood kicking off with Roku losses. They're pretty dramatic following that much worse than expected. A wider than expected loss. I should say here for the coming quarter. The stock off just around 19% as a result of just the losses quarter may come to 135 million putting that in perspective. That's about three times what analysts were expecting to hear from Roku. Obviously the slowdown that we're seeing in terms of the advertising market having a massive impact on Roku over the last three months. Stock off just around 28% year to date. You're looking at losses of over 76%. The company also saying that it's going to slow hiring as a result of what we're seeing playing out in the broader economy right now. And CFOC of a loud and is going to be leaving Roku next year. Let's take a look at Qualcomm and another mover here moving to the downside off and nearly 6% guidance coming in week. We just talked to Christopher Roland of Susquehanna. He said that it's the worst Qualcomm guidance that he has seen in years rapid weakening in demand elevated inventory a couple headwinds here facing Qualcomm.

4705," Is the record for the highest-selling professional sports team about to fall? That's the question with news at the Washington Commanders' announcement today. Owner Dan Snyder's hired Bank of America's securities to consider, quote, potential transactions involving the franchise. Now, Congress and the NFL continue to investigate Snyder over a toxic work culture, as well as an allegation of sexual misconduct. Snyder has already been fined $10 million by the league. It's set a reportedly paid $750 million for this team in 1999 that today Forbes values at $5.6 billion. And Shana, once you get a name like, oh, let's say Jeff Bezos involved, which I believe is actually a possibility here unlike the previous rumors, you're talking north to $6 billion easy for this team. Yeah, it's going to be interested to see one who is interested in buying this team. Of course, more details just in terms of the sale. Haven't we don't have those yet. So I think that's going to be critical just in terms of identifying a potential buyer. But that value is really incredible. You mentioned the fact that now it's worth Forbes estimates. It's now worth $5.6 billion Snyder own the team, has own the team since $9,880 million for it. That really speaks for Shell to the astronomical rise that we have seen in the value of teams in the NFL. And certainly this getting a lot of attention and it will be interesting to see who exactly gets involved. It will be fun if it was Bezos. It'd be great. Great for the game. I mean, I'll say, obviously, the commanders are my local team. I've been watching them since I was in college back in the 1900s. But a lot of people, like when you look at some of the mixed reactions to this news, some people doing happy dances. A lot of people wondering, why is he even selling? A lot of people thought that Densnider would never sell. Now, it's important to note that they did list in that statement they were exploring potential transactions, ESPN tweeting. It's unclear if this means they're exploring a sale of the franchises a whole or seeking a minority owner. I thought it was interesting that former Washington quarterback RG3 said he tweeted, who wants to be a minority owner of the Washington commanders? I'm down to pay for stake in the team and bring 10 fans along for the ride. So who knows? Who knows where this is going to go still early days? But clearly, a lot of interest in this, right? Certainly early days in Congress is still investigating Densnider, the NFL investigating Snyder for a second time. So the interest is to see how this all plays out. All right, then. I'll do it for us today on Yahoo Finance Live. Be sure to come back tomorrow at 3 p.m. Eastern Time for all your coverage leading up to and after the closing bell. We'll see you then.

4710,"? Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live this morning. Major averages here in the US are lower across the board off of the session lows, but even within these first 11 minutes of trade, you're still seeing them in the red for more. Let's get on over to the Wi-Fi Interactive where Jared Blycker joins us with a little bit more color on today's tape. Yeah, unfortunately. Color is red. The words right out of my mind. Sorry. That's fine. Powell really meant it. He really did. We keep saying that, but let me show you the three day price action in the S&P 500, because we are in a downtrend. Once again, that's off about 3.5% the NASDAQ taking it on the chin a little bit more down 5%. And let's take a longer term view of the S&P 500. This is over a few months here, three months, and here is the last peak that we had. Here is the last low. This is the low of the year, and we are right back down here. Pretty big day yesterday. And I think it's instructive to see what's happening in the bond market. We didn't really get the huge reaction yesterday, but overnight in this morning, we're seeing huge movement, a shift upwards in the yield curve. Now the five years up, 17 basis points. That is a huge amount. Here is a 14 basis point, 13, 30 year up a little bit less. That's nine basis points. And a 13 week T bill yield, closely matching the Fed funds rate. That's a very short end of the curve. That is flat right now, although it did punch to new relative highs yesterday. And the US dollar, we haven't talked about, or I haven't talked about this in a few days, that is racing higher once again. Now these are 20 year highs in the dollar index, and we've gone through it. It is influenced mainly by European. The Euro and also the pound, but I'll tell you what, here's another currency, Bitcoin. Even Bitcoin could barely get off the dime yesterday, although it's not selling off that much today. So maybe there's a ray of hope here. WTI crude futures, we're going to get some more futures acted in a little bit, about $88 a barrel, nothing big going on there. Now here's a sector action for today, energy in the forefront, but I want to give us a two day view so we can really see what has happened, what the market is pricing in in terms of the Fed. XLK, that is a tech sector that is down the most 5% followed by communication services. And real estate, we didn't even get to the futures market. Natural gas here in a downtrend of New England worried about not having enough supplies for the winter. Europe also worried about not getting enough LNG. Nevertheless, we can see that market down 3% today. GARB BLEKER Y E M E E Baret CO.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,1,2022-11-03 13:45:24
4711," New England worried about not having enough supplies for the winter. Europe also worried about not getting enough LNG. Nevertheless, we can see that market down 3% today. Jarred Blyckery on fire at the board. Appreciate it. All right, big stat of the day. We're up to our attention. Our executive producer, Vouncing and Caval, pretty shocking when you think about this one. Actually, Apple finished Wednesday session with a $2.31 trillion market cap, a corn kiyow finance data, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta were worth it, combined $2.3 trillion. Meta's meltdown, of course, this year, back or helping to drive that underperformance. They are big, Apple-O indeed, the winner. All right, Twinkie maker, Hostess, baked up another good quarter. Hostess, CEO, Andy Callan, stops bar for chat next. Cheers of Hostess brands are on the move. After the snack brand reported, it's 11th straight quarter of over 9% revenue growth and said higher prices count to 40% of the rise. Hostess, Brantzio, Andy Callan joins us now to discuss, and you always nice to see here. We're sure getting some pretty good reads on consumers back out there traveling and moving around. What are you seeing in your brand within convenience stores? Yeah, well, you know, the breath of our portfolio is pretty wide across all channels. Convenience stores certainly an important channel for us. We do see a lot of resiliency. You know, we have an on-the-go or high impulse category. Consumers are back traveling. We're in two spaces, both with macro trends and tailwinds behind us for our sweet baked goods. And one of them is indulgent and permissible snacking of which our portfolio and Twinkie fits the bill. Convenience is very resilient. Consumers are still traveling and they're going through whether it's around the home more. When they're in the, around the home more, they're traveling around the home more. That's good for our business and when they're driving more, that's good for our business. So we're really seeing a lot of resiliency including in our convenience channel, which point of sale grew above.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,2,2022-11-03 13:49:19
4712," around the home more. That's good for our business. And when they're driving more, that's good for our business. So we're really seeing a lot of results, including in our convenience channel, which point of sale grew above 13% of this last quarter. And I'm also curious, Andy Hage, Julie here, which categories, which subcategories are doing the best right now? What's sort of the hottest product out there? Well, our core icons always do well. You know, we're pre-pads. And most of our portfolio is prepared for snacking and our two iconic brands, or iconic brand hostess with all of its subbrands as well as our Whartman portfolio, which is a little bit more than 10% of portfolio are both performing well. By the way, Whartman point of sale was up 28.8%. So we see indulgent snacking on total, a really continuing half trail winds. That's been before the pandemic, and that's now today. And we really have a pure play snacking portfolio. So we're well positioned to capitalize on that growth with the assets to achieve that growth. We see morning breakfast continuing the growth. That's a $5.8 billion segment. We recently launched Bound Show that really attacks the lunch box occasion at 6.2 billion in total consumer occasions. So this indulgent snacking is really moving across the board in the faces of we compete. Our Whartman portfolio, by the way, is the number one share within sugar free for cookies, an $8 billion total category, but it's growing and more than twice a rate of total cookies. So we were really positioned well for macro consumer trends. Andy, you've put up several good quarters in a row now. What is it about a twinkie or the other products that they're selling? There are other snacks out there. Had you survey folks on why they're gravitating to your brands? Well, there's a couple of things. First of all, even during times of recession or when times are good, consumers reach for permissible and indulgent snacks that they feel are at an accessible price point. We're maniacal and making sure we provide the right value to our consumers when they have. The other thing that we really spent a lot of time over the last three or four years is focusing on our product quality. So when consumers come and they want an indulgent snack, they want it to be a good reward. They don't need a lot, but they need it in a portion controlled form. We've invested in product quality, our penetration in households is going up. And but also we're accessing and adding two times buyer to our category, to our franchise, to our host's business, as greater than twice the rate of the rest of the category. That means when consumers come and try us, they'd like it and they're coming and repeating. So we're doing all of the fundamentals at right. I don't top of that are increasing advertising to build the gap between our aided awareness and top of mind awareness and our innovation. And you get a recipe for 11 straight quarters above 90% growth. Andy, you talked about holding the line on value. At the same time, you did take price, right? Because that's one of the things, or the main thing that was responsible for the revenue bump here. So how do you calculate that a and b, what happens to price now going forward? Are you gonna keep on raising? As we sit here today, what we see, especially as we close out the years, we only talk about 23, we have the pricing in the marketplace to obviously deliver our raised guidance. We raised our revenue and profit of top and bottom line guidance for the full year of FY 22. This is the way we look at it. We take the value that we deliver to consumers, very serious. And then we also have a suite of tools that we love. We utilize to leverage the efficiency of which we deliver then we balance both of those. So in the quarter, despite having a 20% pricing that moves through the consumer, our gross margin still contracted a little less than a hundred basis points. We believe over time given our revenue growth management initiatives, our productivity initiatives, and when needed, when we get this high of inflation, it was above 18% in the quarter, as a last resort we do move the pricing. So that's why pricing's in the marketplace now. We think we have the right balance going forward, but given our agility and our continued focus on the fundamentals, if needed, we're in a position to do that. We don't believe we are today. We are committed to, by the way, of recovering our gross margins over time. And as a reminder, our growth algorithm is to a mid-single-digit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,3,2022-11-03 13:53:20
4713," of recovering our gross margins over time. And as a reminder, our growth algorithm is to a mid-single-digit top-line growth at 5% to 7% EBITDA growth and 7% and 9% EPS growth, which we believe will continue even from this going forward, despite our incredible performance of the last three years, lead to top tier shareholder return. Andy, real quick, before I let you go, what is your one big product that you're going to launch next year? Anything you could take us inside the C-suite? Well, we're in the process right now of launching our bouncer. So bouncer's as our focus, it targets a lunchbox occasion. It reimagines some of our icons like Twinkies and Ding Dons and Donets. It puts it in a poppable form, that a two-by-poppable form, and it's perfect for the lunchbox or any carried occasion. Retailer acceptance has been extremely positive. We're very proud of it. We're ramping up the consumer advertising here as we move into Q4. We're very enthusiastic. Obviously, consumers will tell, but we're obviously very positive about that. We have a great track record of innovation that we've built over the last several years. Bouncer's. All right. Hostess Francio and E. Calahan, thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it. I always good to see you. Appreciate you, Heather. Yeah, you too. Let's take a look at some economic data just coming out. S&P services, PMI, purchasing managers, index showing a sharper contraction than the initial read for the month of October here, coming in at 47.8, the composite PMI coming out at 48.2. Remember anything below 50 does signal contraction here. And it's interesting because the manufacturing data that we got was better than estimated. So, the services contraction is interesting that we are seeing here. And the folks at S&P Global saying the latest data signals, a modest contraction and business activity across the service sector, lower new orders, panelists attributed weak client demand to the impact of inflation and interest rates on increased client hesitancy and more frequent order post-pomance. Indeed, we're seeing a lot of that abounding. We're getting the ISM numbers on the same front in just a bit. Coming up, sticking with food, Brian Sons is going to help us digest the latest quarter from Papa John's, let's next.

4715," everyone. Welcome back to how finance I'm Brian Saazie alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Investors are still digesting conflicting commentary from Fed Chief Jerome Powell on Wednesday, which hammered stocks into the close. And today we're sifting through a host of EPS reports, everything from a disaster like Roku to surprising profits at Robinhood. Right now we're seeing all three major indices deeply in the red. But Julie, let's get over to you. Some breaking news on the comment. Yeah, we have the services gauged from the Instavers Supply Management coming in at the slowest pace since May of 2020. 54.4 was the reading 56.7 was what it was in September. So it declined there. Obviously, this is a little better than estimated. 53.3 is what economists was looking for. And above 50 does signal expansion. So unlike the S&P Global Read that we got just a moment ago, this is a different slicing and dicing. And it's one that looks a little bit better. We did see measure of business activity within the index declining to a five month low. The new orders component of this falling to the lowest level since June. And the prices paid in index part of this is increased and does remain elevated. So still seeing not a terrible picture here, but not a fantastic one either. That prices paid component to 70.7 from 68.7. So all of this indicates that we still have expansion in the services part of the economy, but we're seeing a slowdown in that expansion. And look, you saw the market come back just a little bit. This is a market that may just wants to reward any data that misses. Maybe. I saw that. I knew you could do that. No, so. And we should also mention we just got mortgage rates in the last few moments as well. The new data from Freddie Mac showing that we saw now a redip under 7%. It was above 7% last week when we got this 30 year number. Now it is 6.95% that is the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac. I mean, whether it's a little bit above 7 or a little bit below. As the man says, it's too damn high as the man says about the rent anyway. So watching that as well as a continuing headwind. Indeed. And we're taking a look at the major averages to see how they're reacting to the economic data, the Dow Jones industrial average about 33 minutes into trade is lower by 324, 327 ish points there. One point to the downside right now, the Nasdaq composite, you're seeing that down by about 1.7% on the day, 177 points in negative territory. And the S&P 500, you're also taking a look at some red on the screen there. It's down to the tune of nearly 50 points, 1.3% in the red. Let's take a look at some of the other major moves that we're tracking here on the day. And I wanted to pull up a pharma and the broader healthcare space as well here. And perhaps I'll put this on an equal market rating just so we could actually see some of the names here. Sigma had reported on the day that reported earlier this morning, moving higher on the earnings report by about 1.5% and of course we've broken down some of the other major earnings reports that have come out today as well to the tune of Moderna you heard that earlier. And so now let's just take a quick look at where some of the sector activity is continuing to move. It's going to be deeper in the red from when we last checked in on it. Take a look at, and this is over the past two days. So let's just put this on the right scale here. Intraday, we are seeing technology sector now down 2.4% at this point in time. And so continuing to see that decline or energy just barely creeping into the green there up by a fraction of a percent, 3.10% there. Well the Fed, staying the course and its aggressive fight against inflation with another rate hike. So let's move, set to further dampen markets and make mortgages and other loans less attractive. For a look at how this is going to affect your personal investments, let's turn to Catherine George, wealth stream advisors, senior advisor. Alright, Catherine, take us into your reaction yesterday after the commentary from.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,6,2022-11-03 14:06:24
4716," Your personal investments, let's turn to Catherine George, wealth stream advisors, senior advisor. All right, Catherine, take us into your reaction yesterday after the commentary from Fed Chair Jay Powell, the decision from the FOMC and how the markets are digesting this as well. I mean, we've been seeing this for a while, right? They've let us know that this rate height was coming and the market price that in a while ago. You know, maybe there's some short-term noise here, but we were expecting this. Maybe we weren't expecting to hear that in 2023, that could be additional rate rises, which is why the market is probably reacting the way that it is. But, you know, we've been through this economic cycle before. It's not that unexpected and the stock market, the bond market will all come back. And it's actually a great thing for the bond market, but, you know, happy to go into stocks, bonds, whatever you're most curious about. Well, let's talk about the bond market. Let's linger on the bond market, if you will, a little bit. It hasn't been a great time for the bond market thus far this year, right? And you've got both stocks and bonds that have been losing on the year, which is an unusual occurrence. As you said, you know, we've seen this environment before. That particular piece of it is not so common. So how do you navigate through that for your clients? You're right. And, you know, in the bond market, it's a little bit different in the stock market and that the price today doesn't matter all that much as long as you stay invested. You know, the bonds we bought last year become less valuable because a new bond will pay you a higher coupon rate. But as long as you hold on to that bond that we bought last year, you're still gonna get the same coupon payment that they promised you and you're still gonna get your principal back in maturity. So, you know, that's the one thing. But once those bonds start to mature, you're actually gonna be able to buy much more attractive bonds at higher rates and it's gonna be, you know, much healthier for your overall portfolio, especially for those investors that have a decent portion of bonds, let's say you're headed for retirement or you're in retirement, you're actually gonna start to be able to earn a decent return on that portion of the portfolio whereas, you know, the past 10 years, we haven't seen that. So it's actually a good, good future outlook for the bond market. It's just a waiting game. Catherine, as we're seeing today, the market does not like when the Fed comes out here and suggests that rate hikes are going to continue for the foreseeable future. Having said that, is there anywhere, anywhere an investor can hide out in this volatile environment? You know, hiding out is, it's a tricky thing. So the first thing I'd say is don't overreact, right? Stay invested, keep your stocks and bonds where they are and don't overreact. But I think the biggest thing is the cash, right? We're finally able to earn some return on our cash. If you're uncomfortable with putting any other extra cash in the market right now, then make sure you're getting some sort of a return on that. You know, online bank accounts are offering about 3% right now just to sit in cash. And Treasury bills, I mean, you get a six month treasury bill for 4.5% right now. That's a very liquid, you know, market. 4.5% is great. So that's one option. But really, if you're feeling like you can take a little bit of risk right now and you have extra cash on top of your emergency reserve, and maybe a little bit extra if you have a job that you're worried about in a pending recession. But if you have some extra cash, stocks are on sale. You know, it's actually a really good time to put some long-term money away as long as you can stomach kind of the ups and downs of the market. You know, even with today's move lower, we're not sitting at the lows in terms of this larger kind of downtrend that we've seen for the major averages and the markets more broadly here. Do you believe that a recession has been priced in at least at the bottom end of where we've kind of seen the activity take place over the past few months? Yeah, so I can tell you that I think everyone is expecting a recession and that's lights likely priced in. Are we at the bottom? I have no idea. But if we look back to 2008, 2009, you know, behind the time the recession was actually announced, the stock market was already on the way back up. So, you know, recessions are back, we're looking, and as we all know, stock markets are forward looking. So while they're related, you know, if the recession comes out in three months, that doesn't mean our portfolios are gonna drop another 20%. You know, everyone is starting thinking about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,7,2022-11-03 14:10:43
4717," So while they're related, you know, if the recession comes out in three months, that doesn't mean our portfolios are going to drop another 20%. You know, everyone is already thinking about this. It's been in the news for the past year. So yeah, I think it's already priced in. I just, you know, we just don't know if it's going to drop a little bit more than any time. Catherine George, Wealthstream, Adviser, Senior Advisor. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks for having me. All right, before we head to break, let's check in on shares of Elf Cosmetics after the four quarter from Estee Lauder on Wednesday. Elf put up, put on its best face on the third quarter topping profit estimates by 20 cents on the back higher prices and consumers trading down to cheaper lip gloss and face scrubs. Company lifted its full-year sales guides to 22% to 24%, 24% from 14% to 16% previously. Jeffrey Zannels, Ashley Helgans, notes that Elf is gaining shelf space at Target and Walmart ahead of the holiday shopping season as well. Elf on the shelf. Elf on the shelf. Go up. Very nice. That's a home run, Brad. Coming up, we'll speak with the CFL of Cheg. On the back of that, our ring's report is the stock price exploding higher. Let's next. Let's get down to business now. Take a look at some of the other headlines we're watching. Food delivery service Instacart will pay out its first company wide cash bonus in December. That's going to the Wall Street Journal. That move aims to boost employee morale among its corporate team during the holidays following the company's decision to delay its public offering, the mid-tightening economic conditions.

The woman who identifies as Hispanic claims she was subject to racial discrimination by basis of staff and also forced to work long hours in unsanitary conditions without rest or breaks, which led her and other Housekeeper, she says in the suit, to develop urinary tract infections. WADA has worked for wealthy and high-profile families for 18 years with no issues according to her lawyers. Meanwhile, lawyers representing basis as LLCs say the claims have no merit. Former CBS CEO Leslie Moonvez and CBS owner Paramount reached a $30.5 million settlement with the Office of New York's Attorney General, LaTisha James. The state alleged that Moonvez concealed multiple sexual assault allegations from regulators, shareholders and the public for months, Moonvez stepped down in 2018 following those allegations. Paramount will pay $28 million to the state, 22 million of which will go back to CBS shareholders and 6 million to strengthen mechanisms for investigating sexual harassment claims. Moonvez himself must pay $2.5 million, which will also go to CBS shareholders. Brad? Thanks so much, Julie. While homework helper, Jay, they aced their third quarter and boosted its full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA as college enrollment begins to stabilize here a little bit more. Chuck, Chief Financial Officer, Andy Brown joins us now. Andy, thanks so much for taking the time and helping us run through the quarter. If you got to think of one catalyst that really sticks out to you within the business from this past period, what is that? Yeah, it's been an interesting 12 months for Cheg and as you had mentioned, things like what we're seeing in the headwinds that we saw maybe a year ago have now stabilized. As far as catalyst with respect to Cheg, I mean, one of the things that we have been doing is pushing what I'll call offering our premium price option. We call the Cheg Study Pack and we continue to see a great momentum there adding more value to the study pack and more of our students are taking that premium price option and that's had a very nice impact on not just our revenue growth but our earnings. As you saw in our report, we blew through our earnings and we raised our guidance quite significantly. When we think of the past two years, it's really changed the way that a lot of colleges, universities might think about where people can be educated from, how they can be educated, what type of opportunities that create for Cheg even in a Renaissance moment for education or kind of a new normal that we're heading towards? Well, you know, when we came to Cheg, our CEO came 13, 14 years ago. I'm now in my 13th year here. We were a textbook renter, but our vision was always that we would offer many types of services online and we used to use the term and continue to use the term that you bet on the inevitable. And the inevitable is that more and more things are going to be done online. And so we embarked upon offering subscription services, homework help services that were exactly how students wanted and that is their relatively inexpensive, their online, their available 24 by 7 and those are the types of services that students expect and we continue to deliver. Whereas, you know, the traditional college experience was all of the help was on campus, but that's not the modern student today. I mean, I think a lot of people don't realize is that, you know, you may think of a traditional four year residential school, but many of the many students in today's environment are actually part time students, they're commuting into community colleges. They don't have the ability to get help, you know, at the institution. And so we provide that opportunity to learn anywhere, anytime, any place. And Andy, you guys are also expanding more into things that have nothing to do with traditional students, that is college students, right? You're looking more to the corporate world as well. I know you have a partnership that allows companies to give their employees language learning. How big a part of your business is that and how much are you looking to that business for growth?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,9,2022-11-03 14:19:14
4719," to give their employees language learning. How big a part of your business is that and how much are you looking to that business for growth? Yeah, so you're talking about our skills platform. And we've believed for a long period of time that, you know, while most of what we do today or have historically has been academic learning, we believe skills-based learning will play a much larger role, is playing a much larger role and will continue to play a larger role in the future. So to your point, we have several skills products. One is what we call our thinkful line of services and then more recently language learning with BUSU. And we do work with a company called Guild that then delivers those services to large corporations like at Chipotle and a Wal-Mart and so forth. And more recently, and what we announced on our earnings call is that we were going to be including our language skills services through Guild starting in 2023. So we do believe, you know, when you imagine check, I'll call it two to three years from now, skills will be a much bigger part of our revenue and contribution. And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw an adjusted EBITDA in the positive. Where is that coming from? How are you guys achieving that? And what are some of your targets on that front? Yeah, so we've always focused on profitable growth. And that's always something that we've talked about at our company and as you can see, we continue to do that. We had a nice beat in Q4. But inherently in our model, because we've got a fairly fixed content cost and much of our users come through unpaid sources, it's just natural that as we scale, our margins will scale. And I'll just remind everybody, I mean, we're profitable across every line. It's not just EBITDA, it's not just non-GAP. We're GAP profitable. So we do believe that we'll continue. We're not going to put a cap on where that would be. We're not at a steady state profitability yet. We do believe that as we scale, we will continue to increase our margins. Andy, while we have you, this has been a significant year, perhaps the most significant that I can remember in terms of student loan debt relief and kind of the conversation to advance the cost of college and reforming the high expenses that families and individuals incur. Perhaps from the Cheg Lens, you can give us your read through moving forward from here. Where some of these costs can start coming down, given that Cheg was one of those platforms that ultimately can reduce the costs on the book front that were so extensive for a lot of college goers and education seekers. Yeah, so it is painful. And I think this is more of a, it pains me to see college students going to college taking on large debt, but then are unavailable to actually pay it off. And that's what you're seeing. So does that disconnect on the ROI? In many cases, not all cases, but in many cases, the ROI. And I think that is a big part of what, as a society, we need to fix. What is the ROI of going to college? So we don't get into these situations where students fundamentally can't pay that debt off, which is real simple. There wasn't an ROI on that particular student's education. So I think that's the fix that we need to do. And that still hasn't been accomplished. Andy Brown, thanks so much for being here. Cheg's Chief Financial Officer, appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, retail, round up, we'll break down some more earnings from Under Armour, Etsy and Crocs. All of them in the green. Look at that. That's on the other side of the break. Otter that comes from Dunn,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,10,2022-11-03 14:23:41

4721," Crocs has continued to run away not just during the pandemic, but among sentiment even post pandemic as people are Getting back into even some of the more kind of social constructs that they had pre-pandemic Crocs has been it's had some staying power quite frankly and the specific partnerships that they've been able to drum up Whether that be with different brands. I think they had one with peeps They had one with Justin Bieber as well, and so all of that considered that's continued to pay dividends for them over time and And I'm getting the boots you heard it here first. I think they just might be for women I can't I'm on the side. I can't tell but I don't think any of their stuff is No, gender Yeah, okay, most of it is units. I mean, look what I mean. I am I have been seeing some sales stuff on the site I have to say so that's something important to note because You know, I didn't have a chance to look at their inventory numbers full disclosure, but up 100 million, but they've definitely There definitely have been some sales stuff on there, so that's something to note. Yeah, and just to put a number on that direct to consumer comparable sales That was up 18.2% as I was able to log back into my computer. Oh, let's also take a look at under armor shares here on the day Are they protecting this house? Yes, they are. All right. The only way is through it's up by about 15 16% right now The athletic wear company posted it slightly better than expected second quarter results But cut back its guidance citing the stronger dollar and a quote more challenging retail environment It's challenging indeed. You're taking a look at the actuals versus the estimates on your screen and turn around had to start Sometime, but it's not a full turn around. I didn't see really any signs of a turn around This is maybe this was the peloton turn around with the the green shoots Maybe Barry McCarthy should write this company's I'll let her to as well But look they came out lower their guidance and one of the biggest concerns is holiday season in retail is all the inventory Sitting at various stores and one of the most promotional brands in the store right now remains under armor And it's just not what this brand was founded on I remember saving up a lot of money to buy my first Moisture wicking under armor shirt. I had to pay full price. It was a six or seven years ago Maybe even longer than that, but still you go now to TJ Maxx You go to Marshall's this stuff is on sale 10 20 bucks a pop well and their inventory was up by 29% so that You know, but that's in line with what we've seen from others They did cut the forecast as you mentioned, but that forecast cut was largely expected analysts were saying they got to cut the forecast So I guess their acknowledgement of reality was a good thing Also really surprising here Asia Pacific sales up to 7% like who else had Asia Pacific sales I'm getting basketball. Yeah, yeah, they've been sending Steph Curry there every single summer to do a Grassroots just boots on the ground, but still given how shut down things have been there and given what we've been hearing from other companies That's been surprising remember they still don't have a permanent CEO by the way remember Patrick first left This has always been Kevin Planck's house you cover under armor too is yeah as a while even when Patrick first was in there I mean it's very much Kevin Planck's baby his ship He may not be running a day a day, but you know he sends an email you're getting it done right he was steering it And I think for what under armor has gone up against and continues to go up against This is not going to get any easier for them and so continuing we had to have The nostalgia factor that you were mentioning a moment ago everybody remembers their first under armor experience I still have it used my life. I'm used to this shirt to play softball You know it helped me recover a lot faster At least that's what I told myself and then I hit better and I threw the ball further it was amazing, bro It was that aura that you take on but still carrying on I'm wearing it underneath the shirt And so it's really Let's go to the Julie Hymn trade here at she shares of surging After its third quarter earnings beat estimates the e-commerce platform also issued up Be cute for guidance of 700 to 700 to 780 million versus expected almost 750 million Julie that pretty good conference call I think the street was really positioned for something bad from Etsy and they didn't get it Yeah, I think there were position for bad from all three of these companies probably and that's why maybe you're seeing Paws is such a positive reaction to them. I mean Etsy which has been challenged This year certainly with the stock chart What's interesting here is if you look across the board the marketplace revenue was up to services revenue was also up And that's something that the company has really been pushing its services to its sellers as a reason for the Distate on the platform because we're call Etsy is competing with the likes of Amazon when you're talking about these small sellers Amazon has really tried to court them and Etsy's tried to hold on to them by offering what they think is a better",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,12,2022-11-03 14:32:23
4722," But the likes of Amazon, when you're talking about these small sellers, Amazon has really tried to court them, and Etsy's tried to hold on to them by offering what they think is a better experience. Yeah, down in the gross merchandise sales, though, that was lower by about 3.3 percent year over year. However, they did see some growth in that marketplace revenue. They saw growth in services revenue as you were mentioning a moment ago, and that directly dovetailed into that gross profit. That rose by about, looks like 10 percent, a little over 10 percent in this most recent quarter as well. Everyone coming up, Qualcomm, taking a hit from its weak guidance and implemented hiring freeze. We're going to break down those results next. Brightening. This is the most insanlar growth time ever on the screen. I think sincerely, it's been more than 5%. What it looks like. I'm sorry. But the biggest win for us was going to help us react. We're continuing to watch shares of Qualcomm this morning after the company slashed its forecast for smartphone shipments and gave a gloomy sales outlook for more let's bring in technologists research president chief analyst bob odonald bob great to speak with you as always here all right we come out of this quarter and really kind of back out what they had to say and and really look through the the core fundamentals of the business but also the trends in the headwinds that are persisting for them what really sticks out to you. Well look Qualcomm has been on a journey of changing into a much broader company for several years now really but we're really starting to see it come into play but the fact of the matter is 56% of the revenue this last quarter was for smartphones right that's still a huge chunk and that's why there's been so much focus on you know their numbers and their expectations but as with the PC market we're seeing that the smartphone market is is taking this post pandemic dip and it's going to be difficult there's a bunch of inventory out there just as again we've seen with the PC guys there's a lot of similarities in terms of what's been happening out there on that front but you know they did have that automotive analog",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,13,2022-11-03 14:37:08
4723," bunch of inventory out there just as again, we've seen with the PC guys. There's a lot of similarities in terms of what's been happening out there on that front. But, you know, they did have that automotive analyst day a couple of weeks ago in New York talking about all the automotive business they have. Of course, they're providing the chipset for Meta's new VR headsets. They're doing a number of areas because what they're able to do is leverage the technology they have, particularly around things like modems and RF. Stuff that's really, really hard to do as Apple is learning and apply that in a number of places. They've had this in automotive for a long time, you know, what's called the telematic systems. And they've been driving that for a long time. Now, as they have more advanced processors that originally started in the smartphone market, they're bringing that into the automobile market. And, you know, as we move to software-defined cars and much more capabilities, Qualcomm is saying, hey, look, you've been working with us for a long time anyway. We're a natural entree for you to bring some of these advanced capabilities to digital cockpit, to the Snapdragon RIDE, format that they have or platform, excuse me, that they have. So, you know, it's this typical thing with semiconductors. Right now, short-term is pretty tough for just about all of them. Long-term, those companies that have really diversified themselves, I think have a really strong growth story. Qualcomm is one among them. AMD, of course, similar type of situation. They just reported earlier this week as well. What is this correction in the level of inventory? When does that ease and start to improve? You know, Brian, I mean, they've said, you know, in the call, they said it's going to be several quarters to get through that inventory. Again, we're hearing relatively similar types of things from some of the other big semi-focus. So, I think that's just a reflection of the fact that, again, a lot of people are slowing down the pace at which they, with which they upgrade their smartphones. I mean, let's think about it. We're not seeing a whole lot of innovative smartphone designs. You know, everything is much more incremental. We've had a few big jumps with foldables, but they're still a small piece of the market. You know, iPhones are evolving, but again, modest pace. So, there isn't that overwhelming sense that I have to have the latest new great smartphone. Now, there's still plenty of upside for 5G smartphones. You know, that's, of course, where Qualcomm's strength has typically been. So, I think you're going to see them continue to develop that market, but it's just going to be at a slower pace and people are going to have to get used to that in the short term, remembering that there's still those long-term opportunities. Bob, hey, it's Julie here. I have to wonder about the implications for Apple, right? Because we keep getting these signs that smartphone sales are going to weaken. This is, Qualcomm is just the latest. Apple shares today are down more than 3%. And I'm curious how long you think this pain is going to last for the smartphone market? I think it could be a while. I mean, I think we could be, again, drawing analogies to the PC market, maybe not declining quite as rapidly, because PCs grew even more during the pandemic, and therefore, unfortunately, are falling even more. But smartphones did reasonably well during the pandemic, but again, people are like, OK, I'm good for a while. And the average lifetimes we've seen growing over time, and now that's really kind of hitting. And when people have to make a decision, you know, if things get tough from a macro-acronomic perspective, they're like, look, my phone is good. And it's getting easier to get them repaired if you just want to replace the glass, of course, because people do that all the time. So I just don't feel like there's this compelling desire until we start to see something really dramatically different in the smartphone market. And again, we have seen foldables like the Galaxy Fold and some other things, but they're still small. Eventually, I think Apple may do something like that. That'll add some pizzazz to the market, but I still think we're a few years off. But to Apple's challenges that you mentioned, you know, they bought Intel's modem IP. That's the chip that allows you to do the communications with the cellular network. And it's hard stuff. I mean, RF is the radio frequency stuff is very difficult. There's really only two companies in the world that do a well. It's Paul Common Media Tech. And Apple had plans to do their own modem. And they still will. It's just that now they've already delayed it a year. And who knows if it goes even longer. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,14,2022-11-03 14:41:09
4724," And Apple had plans to do their own bottom and they still will. It's just not they've already delayed it a year and who knows if it goes even longer. So that's upside for Qualcomm that nobody expected to happen. So good for them, but offset of course by the fact that the overall market is still declining. If the metaverse takes office Qualcomm a net beneficiary. Yes, it is it is. I mean, because there are, you know, when we think about at least the near term metaverse, I mean longer term we'll see, but near term, you know, they've got the chip that's powering the headsets. Again, there are a couple of other competitors but Qualcomm by far is more advanced in that regard. But you know, I mean, look at it now even, right? I mean, they put that in their IOT revenue and it's still a small fraction of Qualcomm's revenue. So even if it explodes, it becomes a reasonable percentage of Qualcomm's revenue, but nothing compared to smartphones, which to me is just another example and reason why I think the metaverse as some people have touted it is a long way off. Bob O'Donnell, President, Chief Analyst, a technic analysis research. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks. Appreciate you having me. Birken is smack in the middle of trying to reclaim the flame. We'll see how that's playing out with restaurant brand CO Jose Sil. That's next. Checking in on the king. The Burger King that is parent company restaurant brand saw global same-star sales climb 9% led by 10% rise at Burger King and strong international growth restaurant brand CO. Jose Sil is fresh with us off his earnings call. Jose happy national sandwich day to you my friend. We're talking earlier on in the show. Why a lot of companies like yours, the burger players are doing better than the pizza guys. Why do you think that's the case? Well, Brian, thanks for having me. Great to be here on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,15,2022-11-03 14:45:36
4725," on in the show, why a lot of companies like yours, the burger players are doing better than the pizza guys. Why do you think that's the case? Well, Brian, thanks for having me. Great to be here, especially on National Sandwich Day, also on our earnings day. By the way, we have a Popeyes, by one, get one free chicken sandwich during this important national holiday. Look, we're excited, obviously, with the momentum in our brands and our business, and we saw some really strong performance in the quarter that we shared earlier in earnings. I think our brands are well positioned in all moments in time. We have great food, great beverages, at Burger King, Thames, Popeyes, and Firehouse. And we provide great experiences, digital has become a bigger part of our business. We have various service modes, delivery, drive-through, dine-in, curbside, and some restaurants. And we do so with our digital capabilities at a great value. So it's a compelling offer. It's why we grow on frequency, and it's the core element of our business model that's so exciting. And we do so in good times, and especially, and certainly, during challenging times. So I think we're well positioned to benefit from tailwinds in difficult moments because of the business model, the great franchisees that we have, and the amazing food and beverages that we serve in our brands. Even as your customer base might be looking for value within this kind of error, this environment right now, where do you still need to, or have you had to pass through price increases to customers that are looking for not just a good meal, but also a good price steel, if you will. Like I think you have to start with the acknowledgement that consumers are generally value-driven. Value for money has always been a key driver of decision-making in our category, in the quick service or limited service restaurant space. That doesn't mean discounting necessarily, but they're always looking for good value, which means they're looking for taste, quality, sometimes quantity, and overall experience for what they pay. And I think we're very well positioned, as I mentioned earlier, to deliver consistently on those expectations from consumers. Today, consumers, and it's slightly different than the US and Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. But broadly speaking, there's a ton of concern around the macro, right? The inflation, food at home, grocery prices are kind of outpacing inflation away from home in the food category. Gas prices are up, energy prices, especially in Europe are quite steeply increasing. We haven't seen any trade down or trade out of our category, but we know that there is pressure in the consumer and our business does well. Our brands do well when we serve great tasting products, great beverages at a good price, even if we're having to raise prices to address some inflation. And what we do on that is that we make sure we understand CPI, and we know for the US, it's been around 8% for Canada, it's just under 7%, and slowing down a bit. We look at food away from home and at home inflation, we look at a number of different data points. We talk to consumers, and then we take price to address input cost, but we do so in a way that's measured to ensure that we don't chase away our very important customers that are the key to our success alongside our franchisees. Jose, just given those pressures on consumers, do you need a six item dollar menu? Well, look, I think having value and having a balanced menu is always important, Brian. We have a core offering, which is fundamental to success is why people come to Burger King Popeyes, Tins and Firehouse, they know those core items, and they're there consistently for those core items. We have premium offerings, which allow for indulgence and for those treats from time to time. And then we have value as an everyday proposition in each of our brands. We've had dollar menus or kind of entry level alacard menus, I don't know if dollar is any longer the relevant price point, but having an everyday entry level price point product that consumers can go to alacard and or to bundle, I think, is an important aspect of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,16,2022-11-03 14:49:34
4726," Every day, entry-level price point product that consumers can go to, Alacart and, or to Bundle, I think is an important aspect of being abroad based and very thoughtful restaurant business. And that's something that we continue to explore. And look at our teams who are working on quality and product offerings at the right price that allow for customers to come in more frequently and enjoy our brands day in and day out. There was two and a half percent net restaurant growth when you think about the franchisees. What are you hearing from franchisees right now and even potential franchisees in different markets and how they're potentially looking to get into business with restaurant brands? Yeah, we have a lot of excitement around growth in our business and fundamentally restaurant brands and our four amazing iconic brands are growth brands and growth businesses. Yeah, we've got a lot of room for growth internationally for all four of our brands, even Burger King that has north of 12,000 restaurants in international markets. We've got a lot of room for growth. We think domestically with firehouse, with Popeyes, Tins in the US is beginning to rev up their engines from a growth standpoint. And obviously, firehouse has a huge runway domestically as well. Franchisees are excited. They're obviously concerned in near term with the impacts that we're seeing in inflation, commodity costs. That translates not only to food costs but also to construction costs. There's always a challenge around getting permitting and the process of getting approvals to move forward with new restaurants sites. But we have a healthy pipeline. We have a lot of interest from existing franchisees as well as new franchisees to develop our brands domestically and internationally. And we continue to work with our partners to move those pipelines along and continue to grow our businesses. And over time, we think we're on our way to our 40,000 restaurant goal with restaurant brands over the next several years. Jose, I have 10 seconds left and this is National Sandwich Day. Somebody's been out there touting their sales gains in any smack talk form. Look, our brands are awesome. We have firehouse, Burger King, Tins and Popeyes. I think they're the best in each of their categories in Burger, Chicken, Coffee and Sandwich. And I'll let the customers decide who the best brands are. My focus is building a great team working with our franchisees and delivering profitable opportunities for growth across the across our four brands. You're too nice, Jose. You're too nice. Just too nice. Jose is a customer of Popeyes. I can say on this sandwich today that chicken sandwich is family. Thank you so much for joining us here on the show, Restaurant Brands International. Yeah. I was just going to say make sure you try the black and chicken sandwich, which is coming out on National TV and on the 7th of November. Awesome sandwich, really cool experience. It's a flavor of New Orleans all around the country. All right, so I was putting in his notes. So we're going to have to do it. We're going to do it. Restaurant Brands International CEO, Jose Sil, Jose, thanks so much as always. Thanks a lot. Have a great day. You too. Coming up, everyone, Walmart is fighting back against price hikes this holiday season. We're going to share the details on the rollback next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,17,2022-11-03 14:54:06
4727," From here on we go on another pan. Get me the other pan. here at the song you know what time it is. Welcome back everyone. Time for the time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this on the day, Maryott is joining its rival Hyatt and raising its annual profit forecast thanks to higher pricing and a strong rebound in leisure and business travel despite recession risks pulling on consumer spending. It is remarkable how much we've seen the travel demand cited even outside of travel industry earnings reports. We were talking about Papa Johns earlier in today's show and them citing the return, the strong return of travel and how that impacted their business. And here we're also hearing from Maryott and Hyatt, similarly the same in that return of not just the leisure traveler but some corporate travel trickling back into. Yeah, I think we this holiday season is going to be expensive to travel. We've heard now from the airlines as you know we've now heard it from the hotels prices are going up and they were already hard to begin with. One of the reasons that Maryott might be down today, one analyst at Bernstein flagging that the pipeline under construction is falling and falling again. So maybe that's part of the reason that the stock is down a little bit that there is some concern about the recovery of that going into next year of the net unit growth. All right, Wayfair reported Q3 results. It's been slightly on revenue but missed on earnings. So it's a dip in its active customer base and orders per customer. It's now looking for break even EBITDA in 2023. But we're seeing the shares up 9% nonetheless here. Pretty good market response here for Wayfair and Etsy. I think it was a market was expecting worse things from both companies and didn't get it. And I think also we're seeing this theme emerge that when companies are talking about cost cutting, when they're talking about a focus on profitability that the market likes that. Even if the top line numbers or even if last quarter's numbers are looking pretty lousy. I mean when you got a revenue drop of 9% and the stock is up 9%. I don't know. Yeah, an international was dismal. It was down 24% year over year. Now of course the business would be more challenged internationally within some of the areas that Wayfair does operate. But again, they said that they're continuing the work that they set out and really focusing on some of the controllables within Wayfair around driving cost of interest. The nailing basics and earning customer and supplier loyalty. And finally this morning, a little bit of maybe so we're lining going into Thanksgiving Walmart is promising to sell a basket of Thanksgiving dinner ingredients at last year's prices. That's a move to attract customers by easing the sting of soaring US inflation. That lower pricing will extend through December 26. It's going to apply to traditional holiday fair like whole turkeys ham stuffing mixed cream. So as remember, our brick diploma recently told us what it was at a 15% increase. I believe overall in the Thanksgiving basket. So this is good news for people shopping Walmart. Is it good news for Walmart margins? Well, I already decided I'm getting one of those black and chicken sandwich from Burger King for my Thanksgiving. I'm ready to go. I'm actually buying ten of them and free some. That will be our friends giving here on the set. We'll just do the chicken sandwich reviews perhaps. Let's do it. I might be around for Walmart here. You're not going to come to Burger King. I know you're not. I was thinking about you. I wasn't going to buy you. I'm bringing the Popeyes chicken sandwich. Family.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,18,2022-11-03 14:58:23
4728," Okay, man, it might be around. For Walmart here, though. You're not gonna come to Eburger King. I know, you're not. I was thinking, I was gonna invite you. I wasn't gonna invite you. I'm bringing the Popeye's chicken sandwich. Family and Thanksgiving sauce, I'm sorry. It's okay. Sorry. We can do a separate friend's giving. We can do a separate friend's giving. What a downer. Oh, you just basically called me a loser on life, and you say, it's great, thank you. How a great rest of the day. You'll be with your family too, stop lying. Come on, come on, all right, we gotta leave it there. Sorry. I keep up with you. It's gonna continue our cover with welcome concerning your report with King Thanksgiving. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Too late. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. in the east. 8 a.m. here in the west. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. The ultimate level of interest rate will be higher than previously expected. Those comments from FedShare Jerome Powell sending stocks falling, the S&P 500 extending its declines following the worst, bed day declines since January of last year. One of those stocks, haliton, shares their plummeting after reporting another dismo quarter. We're gonna break down the numbers for use straight ahead. And we'll speak to the CEO of Lumenar Technologies. We're gonna ask him about his Q3 results and what he's hearing from car makers. First though, we are doing a market check. As we said, we saw the big U-turn really in the session yesterday and we are seeing the declines continue. With the Dow down 84 points, the S&P 500 down 15 and the NASDAC down 52 in terms of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,19,2022-11-03 15:03:20
4729," you turn really in the session yesterday and we are seeing the declines continue with the Dow down 84 points the S&P 500 down 15 and the Nasdaq down 52 in terms of sectors we are seeing energy kind of the outlier here along with industrials and materials. And of course we are watching yields very closely given the back of that Fed decision that came down yesterday. 10 year yield there. Take a look at that at 415. Let's bring in Jared Blickery for a deeper dive on the market today Jared. How are things looking? Things are looking a little odd I'm not going to say dismal but a little bit red on the US frontier. You can see the Nasdaq leading the way down down about half a percent so not a disaster here. But let me take you inside some of the moves that we've seen in the currency markets now. First I want to start with the British pound because we had a bank of England decision overnight where they raised interest rates there on the short end of the spectrum by 75 basis points. Sound familiar? That's what the Fed did yesterday, but what's different is that the bank of England signalling that they're pretty much done and that markets had anticipated them continuing to raise rates. However, that was a mistake on part of market participants. And so their currency is actually losing value with respect to the US dollar is down 1.5 percent. Might be a little bit hard to see this chart here. This is a three month chart of the British pound versus US dollar. And we can draw this trend line here is broken down so it is racing back down towards parody with the US dollar. Now this is a little bit of breathing room perhaps to the UK people. However, you got to imagine that inflation going to rear its ugly head once again there in a worse situation by the US with recession. They're considered pretty much imminent if they're not in it already want to show you the 10 year Tino yield now at Keiko you just mentioned that it's up to 4.14 percent the five year even higher 4.36 percent and then on the very short end of the spectrum the 13 week T bill yield a bit less than those two so we have the yield curve expanding on the very short end. Now what I want to show you is also the US dollars is going to be inverse to what we're looking at in the pound so it is stronger by 1 percent and by the way these are 20 plus your highs so the US dollar has been giving stocks and other risk markets quite a bit of trouble lately and that is a case today as well. You can see tech communication services really taking on the chin here down about 1.3 percent energy in the green today but look at over the last two days we can see the mega half sectors these three down here down 3.4 almost 5 percent and that's really reflected in the Nasdaq 100 this is again over two days apple down 6.5 percent Amazon a little bit less meta down 5 percent so is alphabet just show you what's happening today a little bit better picture but looking at some losses here guys so we'll have to see what comes of this into the close. Okay still early on in the session here thanks so much for that Jared. Let's take a deeper dive here now on the Fed after the decision to raise rates again by another 75 basis points Fed share power warning levels of U.S. interest rates will go higher than previously projected take a listen. At some point as I've said in the last two press conferences it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal. There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates even so we still have some ways to go and incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected. With more on the road ahead for the Fed look at the Yahoo finances Jennifer Schomburger and Jen we saw the reaction of the markets yesterday but certainly the Fed sure making pretty clear that they are the data is just not where they want it to be. Good morning Kiko that's right Fed share pal setting the table to begin the next day. The Fed is slowing down the pace of rate hikes but says the question of when to moderate the size of rate increases isn't as important as ultimately how high the central bank will ultimately raise the Fed funds rate to team inflation. Pell says interest rates will now rise higher than forecast until the Fed gets to a level that's quote sufficiently restrictive. All this means the interest rate projections for ending rate hikes and forecast back in September are now too low. So the question is how much higher do they go from here? Well Roberto Parley who was a long",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,20,2022-11-03 15:06:59
4730," 0.6% forecast back in September are now too low. So the question is, how much higher do they go from here? Well, Roberto Parley, who was a long time fed watcher over at Piper Sandler, says he thinks the peak rate could rise to 4.8% at minimum. Though he says the fed can't continue hiking at 75 basis points every meeting, which is why they're looking to slow down. If they did, they would reach 10.6% by the end of next year. Now, the market is pricing in a peak fed funds rate of 5.15% in June of next year. That's about 20 basis points higher than before the fed meeting. Will Stith, a bond portfolio manager over at Wilmington Trust, says he thinks the terminal rate might not also be higher, but also stay higher for longer than what the market is expecting, given that the fed hasn't seen progress on inflation like they would. Like, now, Paul says he doesn't think the central bank has overtitened, but perhaps the risk of continuing to raise rates aggressively risks cratering the economy, which is why the fed is looking to slow the pace of rate hikes so the economy can better digest those. Indeed, Alice, over at Bank of America, say that policy lags complicate the ability of the fed to judge their prior actions on the economy, and that now that they're moving into more restrictive territory, the risk-reward trade-off favors smaller rate hikes going forward. I keep going. Okay, certainly a lot to look ahead to. Thanks so much for that, Jen. Well, let's keep the conversation going on the fed and what this means for investors. We've got Priya Mestra, TD Securities Managing Director and Global Head of Rate Strategy. It's interesting here, Priya, when you look at the market reaction to yesterday, it felt like there was a bit of a resetting of expectations after there was so much hope on a potential had fed pivot or a pause. Now that we heard from Jay Powell, where do you put the terminal rate and what does it all end? Sure, thanks for having me. So it was a nuanced message that the fed was trying to convey yesterday. Slow pace, but potentially higher end point. And the focus remains squally on inflation and how quickly does it decline? You know, does it decline? How sticky is it on the way down? And so we actually devised up our terminal rate focus. We were in the 5% camp before yesterday. Now we're thinking 5 and a half by May of next year. And then the fed keeps it there because inflation is extremely broad-based. It has been sticky on the upside. We think it's going to take a while for it to come back down. And we're taking the fed at their word. They're committed to getting inflation down. And so we think they're going to struggle to ease or even stop hiking until their clear signs that inflation has downshifted. And so we think they're going to continue to raise rates. I do think that the risk of recession has become even greater. Because there are lags that the fed cannot see that data right now. The impact of policy tightening. They're going to continue to tighten. And I think as the economy starts to slow down, their task becomes a lot harder because if inflation is high, even if the unemployment rate is rising, I think we can't get a preemptive fed that can start to ease. So it makes the risk of a downturn by in the second half of next year. Very high. We're actually looking for a recession in the second half of next year. And then the fed starts the easing process really in 2024. So it's going to be a tough couple of years as the two conflicts of the fed. I think the two goals of the fed are in conflict. When you say the risk of a recession is higher, I mean, how much more significant? If you're already looking at a recession in the second half of the year, how does that differ from where you were going into the meeting yesterday? Sure. So I think we were anywhere nervous about a recession because it's not just the fed funds rate. You look at the tightening and financial conditions. Or you look at the tenure. Most of us borrow at the five to 10 year part of the curve. And those rates have risen significantly. And it's been a real rate driven increase. So we were anyway concerned that things are slowing. I think which app out, I think reinforcing the inflation commitment, not giving any room to letting lags play out or being willing to tolerate a slightly high inflation for a longer period of time. I think these were all things that the market that's been waiting for a pivot was hoping for. And that's why we saw that big reaction to the statement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,21,2022-11-03 15:11:21
4731," likely high inflation for a longer period of time. I think these were all things that the market that's been waiting for a pivot was hoping for. And that's why we saw that big reaction on the statement because it looked like the Fed was at least nodding to lags. But then it turns out, no, there might be nodding to the lags too for the pace of hikes, but not for the endpoint. And that makes the chance that the Fed takes rates higher. That's why we revised our terminal rate, you know, five and a half QT is also continuing so that can keep pressure on that belly of the curve or the tenure. And that makes the chance of hard landing higher. And I would say the market is under the impression it's a short, shallow recession. Well, if you don't get any monetary help and I don't think we're going to get any fiscal easing, you know, this idea of a short, shallow recession, I am pushing back against that. I think it couldn't need not be a weight-type recession, but a recession that can last for a while because you just don't get that policy support that I think we've been used to the market. The market's been used to getting some help. And I think that help is going to be much harder in a high inflation environment. Yes. So the warning certainly elevated for investors who are out there. Priya, you know, you pointed to the fact that there's always a lag factor with Fed policy. And we certainly heard from the Fed, Terry, yesterday acknowledging that we're now into what four-stray jumbo size hike. I mean, to what extent have we already seen that take hold? And how much of a lag factor are you looking at? Sure. So I think there's a shorter lag between Fed policy and financial conditions. I think transparency, the fact that dot plot, the communication from the Fed makes the, I think, market price in Fed policy in a better way. Of course, Fed policy itself has been extremely hard to call. I mean, they've changed their dot plot significantly every dot plot this year. But I think the financial conditions are pricing it in somewhat appropriately. I think what is unknown is how quickly does inflation come down. And if it is sticky, I do think there's going to be more financial conditions tightening, because that means that the Fed is going to keep going potentially even higher than our forecast of five and a half on the terminal rate. But then there's the big question on when does the economy respond to it? And we've had this big white savings buffer that the consumer has had. That is buffer is dwindling. That that buffer is dwindling. So over the course of next year, we think more in the second third quarter that the consumer starts to pull back. And that's what we will start to result in a recession. The labor market will start to pull down. So, you know, I think the lags might be, there's a lot of talk that the lags might be shorter. I think for financial markets, I get that. But I think for the economy, the lags actually might be longer because the consumer has a savings buffer. So the labor market's going to look tight until that savings buffer is gone and service demand starts to slow down. And we think that's a second quarter third quarter time frame next year. So, which is why the Fed has free rate to keep raising rates really into the face of a recession. So either way you look at it, all signs pointing to more pain ahead. Priya, it's good to get your insights today. Priya, Mr. Rattini, Securities Managing Director and Global Head of Rate Strategy. What is time now for our trending ticker? And today we're taking a look at shares of Roku, hitting a 52 week low today, down about 8 percent despite beating estimate than its latest quarter. The streaming firm warning it expects the macro environment, the pressure consumer discretionary spends further and a great advertising budget. The company expects these conditions to be temporary, although it says it's difficult to predict when they will stabilize or rebound. Roku's now forecasting fourth quarter total net revenue of roughly $800 million and lower year on year player and platform, revenue certainly a deep decline in Roku shares today. Well, coming up, it is another rough day in what has been a brutal year for Palatine investors. After the company issued disappointing guidance, we're going to take a closer look at the numbers on the other side of the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,22,2022-11-03 15:15:41
4732," $12.10 shares of peloton coming off of the lows of the session, but still down more than 3% after the company issued weak guidance for the holiday quarter. Even though the company CEO says quote, the ship is burning. Joining me now to break down the results. We've got city senior analyst and managing director Ron Josie and Ron. Okay, so we can focus on the negative. We know this has been a turnaround story for some time, but I want to flip the question and start with what I think could be a positive. You say this is, you know, sort of the turnaround story is starting to take hold. And we did hear from CEO Barry McCarthy today thing that we're done now in terms of flashing headcount. I mean, what it's, what's the silver lining out of this report if there is any. Yeah, no, OK, go. It's a good question. I mean, because we can talk about the negatives for a while here and there's some things that we definitely need to be aware of, but the bottom line is churn improved in the quarter. We have newer distribution models with third parties like Amazon and Dix on top of Amazon's top of pelton's first party that that should help drive continued growth. You have a cost base that is significantly reduced. I think employees are down over 50% really since February. So really what you have here is a streamlined business that has a tremendously engaged member base where turn is coming more in line with historicals after the pricing increase. And you have visibility, at least we think there's visibility in the greater overall or positive free cash flow towards the end of this fiscal year. So in the back half of this year. So the silver lining here is look, turn around hard. We know that churn is improving that suggests engagement remains strong. And frankly, these newer things that the business has been doing in terms of third party partnerships, their rental program with fast things along those lines that they should improve overall results over the next couple quarters going forward. And when you were on that call today after the earnings results, specifically asking about free cash flow guidance and what made the leadership team feel confident about beating the one year timeline. I mean, how confident are you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,23,2022-11-03 15:20:17
4733, results specifically asking about free cash flow guidance and what made the leadership team feel confident about beating the one-year timeline? I mean how confident are you in their strategy? You know did you feel like you got to satisfy your answer? Yeah no I think it's a really good question I think the answer is yes right I think when you think about the changes that have happened in this business and really just the last six to nine months between the multiple rifts between basically out going from insourcing or being a verticalized strategy from creating your own bikes or manufacturing your own bikes or delivering them yourself to outsourcing all of that this business has gone through a tremendous amount of change and so as we take a step back and we think about where we are today the cost base is much lower so in other words the variable cost structure is certainly better. The member base seems to be stabilized which is strong and that gets to engagement at the end of our day. The day our core thesis here is that engagement drives everything in this business and our view here is that those members that are on the bike stay on the bike for a while here and it's something that we haven't really seen in other type of consumer subscription models so that's positive and then you add to that you know we're going into the holidays with newer distribution partners and so all this combined should help drive better free cash for the other years we just talked about but does it give us more confidence I think the interest yes now to be clear there's changes in this business right so the fast business or the rental bike business it will change the the structure of when peloton generates the revenue their distribution partners third part of distribution partners with amazon and dix will have a lower overall selling price because it's more of a wholesale partnership for the most part that'll impact revenues but I think the profitability should start showing up here over the next couple quarters and naturally the key thing of proving out the viability in the business here so the top line seems to be stable at least in subscribers that's a good that's good and overall cost are are pretty much taken out so we're we're leaner more streamlined organization that should drive a greater overall profitability and sustainability in the business finally really quickly I mean this doesn't change the fact that this is a stock that has seen a steep fall this year we're now looking at eight dollars and forty seven cents a share if the turnaround strategies working and you feel like things are taking hold is this kind of where fair value should be so I mean it's a good question we well our price target you know publishes is certainly higher when if you would strip out everything and just look at the subscriber base and where churn where it is the 1.2 percent x some one time things like you know that there's a lot of value in that subscriber base and as a result we think there's a lot of value in this business and and we think shares are not reflecting that because the turnaround take time especially one of this magnitude especially one that you know went through the pandemic with massive demand being pulled forward and now we're when a completely different environment and macros coming up here as we just heard your prior guest talk about in terms of concern so you know from from a fair value perspective we think there's room to go on shares that said we understand it's a turnaround strategy there's a lot of moving pieces here we want to see that free cash flow better our models suggest we could get there or we can get there and that's really what's going to drive shares here the next call it 12 months or so and that that's our vision or longer term focus on the name. Ron Josie senior analyst and managing director at city always good to have you on a appreciate your insight today thanks a key go likewise and we've got much more earnings to dive into let's bring in Yahoo finances Alexander Seminova Alexander well you know we've gotten so much negative news out of this any can we sort of take away some positive here especially when you're looking at the retailers that have reported so far absolutely a key go it's another big morning for corporate earnings with a flurry of retailers headlining today's results among them is crocs shares are up about 7% after the footwear company reported third quarter figures that beat Wall Street estimates quarterly sales and direct to consumer comparable sales rose sharply as well as revenue for its hey dude brand up 87% during the period the company raised its full year guidance with CEO Andrew Reese citing strong back to school performance and 20% constant currency revenue growth in its crocs brand let's turn now to under armor also beating estimates for the quarter but signaling a less optimistic view of what's ahead for the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,24,2022-11-03 15:24:12

Also beating estimates for the quarter, but signaling a less optimistic view of what's ahead for the company. The sports brand said sales for the 2023 fiscal year are set to rise in the low single digits that's down from the 5 to 7 percent it projected earlier. The company attributed lower expectations to quote a more challenging retail environment and additional negative impacts from changes in foreign currency BMO analyst Simeone Seagull who is a friend of the show telling us this morning that he believes shares are still priced too low. He reiterated his outperform rating on the stock this morning. And speaking of some positive takeaways here, we've got Etsy. That stock just on a tear today up well over 10 percent.

Analyst from Evercore ISI this morning saying the company maintained its pandemic success and is showing healthy levels of profitability as well. Okay, some still relinings there to take away. Thanks so much for that. Alexander Simeonoba. Well, coming up on the other side, Elon Musk. We're reportedly planning a length off half of Twitter staff. We're going to have the details and Netflix rolling out that much anticipated ad supported tear today. Certainly stay tuned to find out what you can expect to see from the new service. We'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,25,2022-11-03 15:28:53
4735," Well, Twitter is expected to shed a whopping 50 percent of its workforce as early as this Friday, this according to Bloomberg and CNBC reports. Twitter's new owner, Elon Musk, remains under pressure to justify his new purchase price, even his industry add dollars. And the overall tech sector revolves on the back of a more cost-conscious consumer. That's bringing Yahoo Finance is Dan Halley who's on top of this story. And Dan, by the way, I was sort of looking at the calendar thinking it hasn't even been a week since this deal was closed, but certainly Elon Musk moving very quickly here, these job cuts, something that was anticipated for some time. Yeah, it'll be a week tomorrow, or maybe tonight, depending on which timeline you're going by. You know, the 50 percent number is interesting because it's actually less than was feared if that is the actual number that Elon Musk ends up going with. Originally, the thought was that he was going to let go of 75 percent of Twitter's workforce, which could have been devastating for the company. 50 percent, obviously still a massive number of employees that would be let go. And then you have to take into account how much it will cost Twitter to actually remove those employees or lay them off. So there's that cost associated with it as well, but over the long term, it would save the company money. And this is something that Elon Musk is really trying to do is just find any way to pull money out of Twitter after you said this really expensive $44 billion acquisition that he himself has admitted to overpaying for. So this is just one of the ways that he's looking at. And Dan, when you think about the business structure of Twitter, it is still primarily driven by ad dollars. Since Elon Musk took over last Friday, we have seen a number of companies come out and say, we just don't feel comfortable staying with the platform because we don't know which direction is going. Yeah, there's been a few agencies and big companies. I believe GM was one of them that put their advertising on hold indefinitely at Twitter. Just to give you a few numbers from Twitter's last, and I guess final earnings report as a public company, they saw a revenue decline, 1% year over year to 1.18 billion. They lost $270 million representing a net margin of negative 23% and costs and expenses ballooned 31% year over year. That's just in one quarter. So obviously, it's not a well monetized company. It's been the complaint that's always gone around Twitter. And then we have Musk now trying to figure out how he's going to make money off of this. One of the ideas obviously was the $20 fee that you would pay to get a verification blue check mark. Then after a back and forth with astonishingly Stephen King of all people, Elon said that he needed to make money and that they would lower it to $8 a month. And that might go into effect on Monday according to reports. So he says the reason for that is to get rid of trolls and bots. I don't know how that's really going to do it. We've seen schemes like this before. We're executives who talked about having customers pay to get rid of bots and spam things along those lines. Famously, Microsoft's Bill Gates when it came to emails. So that didn't work. So I don't know if it's going to work on Twitter either. Would you pay $1 to keep the verification? Good. This is actually good question. Feels like a Twitter poll. That's crazy. Look, I pay Twitter by providing my information. And that's basically what the deal is. It's kind of the fousy impact that we make with all of these social media companies where yeah, we'll provide you with our information and then we'll use your service for free for free in quotes, right? Because you are giving them your information. So if I'm still providing Twitter with my data, you should figure out a way to make that work. And I understand the ad market obviously not where these companies want it to be. YouTube ads missing by $400 million on expectations. And then we have obviously Meta Facebook. They're kind of really treading water there when it comes to the ad market. Snap doing equally is bad. So it makes sense that Twitter would be struggling at least in this environment, but they've always done that. And finding a way to monetize it in a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,26,2022-11-03 15:32:51
4736," Snap doing equally is put bad so you know it makes sense that Twitter be struggling at least in this environment But they've always done that no you know finding a way to monetize it in a better way Make sense, but God I will never pay eight dollars a month for a ridiculous check I think I might be on the same page is you I mean I'm curious that you know you know You know must think essentially we have to pay the bills somehow But it's gonna be interesting to see how many people actually do pay up and worth or think it's worth at eight dollars To keep the check mark, but we shall see we'll continue to follow it. Thanks so much for that Dan Well saying with advertising despite overall gloom as companies pull back on their ad budgets Netflix is charging ahead the streaming service rolling out its ad supported tier in the US with experts and analysts Shrugging off those concerns even as competition grows within ad backed Streaming that's bringing Yahoo finances Ali Canal Who's been looking into this and Ali? I guess you know the question is What's the bar here for Netflix at a time when ads have been slowing down across the board? Well, I think for a company like Netflix the bar has already been set high, right? The platform confirmed that it's sold out of nearly all of its ad inventory globally for the launch and that Optimism has been echoed from both analysts and ad experts alike I spoke to Kevin Kram. He's the CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO and he described this as a quote pivotal moment for the media industry He also cited Amazon's Thursday night football as another watershed moment when we had streaming Subscription and ad supported go to the masses and now with Netflix rolling out ads Disney right behind them This is the new future for consumers in the new future for tech companies for Netflix It's reached peak penetration in the North American markets and this is a way for them to really capture more subscribers There have been some concerns that consumers will trade down but analysts have said that it's actually a spin-up Opportunity a chance for Netflix to secure more revenue Increased profits. That's in the name of the game on Wall Street right now and Netflix needs to capitalize on that in order to remain at the top of the Streaming wars and advertisers seem on war with that as well Yeah, Ali when you look across the streaming Landscape, you know those like who have been early on with with the ad supported tier Netflix entering into new territory with Disney plus right behind it. What's the big risk for Netflix? It's a hundred percent a super big risk if we think about the programming on Netflix It's a lot of mass content right? It's global a lot of it is considered Quote-unquote niche and that's where we could see some potential tension advertisers They like to play it safe They won't content that captures large audiences and that might challenge Netflix's current content strategy another Potential risk could be when it comes to acquiring new licensing agreements to run ads Netflix warned that about five to ten percent of Content will not be available on the ad tier due to those ongoing conversations with studios like Disney and NBC Universal we had a new Wall Street Journal out report earlier this week that noted that shows that are really popular in Netflix like Gray's Anatomy the crown you they could potentially be impacted by this So that's something that they'll have to figure out and then finally another issue is just add integration right how will this interrupt the Binge model that mean Netflix so successful in the first place and how can the company really tackle those Measurement tactics to lower advertisers amid all of this competition So these will just be some of the growing pains but Netflix signal that it's ready for the ride They're ready to innovate and that potential is what's driving up the stock price higher up more than about 35% over the past six months So analysts ready for it investors ready for it. We'll see if consumers are ready for it too Yeah, the counter argument being that this actually might not be a bad time when consumers are trying to pull back on spending So we'll see where those numbers come in Ali. Thanks so much for that Well coming up Qualcomm shares falling sharply week smartphone demand causing the company to issue poor guidance We're gonna break down the numbers for you on the others",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,27,2022-11-03 15:37:12
4737," This closing update may be headed to notice showing someäft remark all major migrants No contact, no questions. Find more stories from the viewer and leave them in the comments box. Qualcomm shares sliding this morning after the chipmaker posted fourth quarter earnings and issued disappointing outlook as weak smartphone demand hit its chip business. Joining us now for more on Qualcomm is keeping capital market equity research analyst, John. John, you know, when you think about where the concerns are, obviously a weak outlook, draw down inventories or concerns about where that demand is going, weighing on the stock today, but you know, you still have a price target that is well above where it's trading. How much of the declines we're seeing you think is justified given the numbers? You know, I think some of the declines are certainly justified, right? You know, their guidance was much worse than expected. I think it was pretty clear and obvious that, you know, self-reduce smartphones, particularly in Android, in China regions and Europe has been particularly weak, but their guidance actually came in, you know, a lot worse than people have expected at this point. And what does that tell you about where things are headed? I mean, we've heard these warnings from so many of these chipmakers. How much of what we heard yesterday is Qualcomm specific? How much of this is about a broader drawdown that we're seeing that's likely to last? I think this is part of a broader drawdown that we're seeing within kind of consumer applications, anything that touches the consumers, PCs, smartphones, consumer electronics has been extremely weak. You know, Qualcomm was issues were compounded by the fact that not only sell through an end to man was weak, but they were also being impacted by kind of a broader inventory correction. What happened during the pandemic over the last couple of years in response to the chip shortages is that customers don't buffer inventory that basically guarantee supply. But now that end demand is starting to soften and supply is starting to normalize, you're seeing a lot of these customers destart.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,28,2022-11-03 15:42:05
4738," supply is starting to normalize. You're seeing a lot of these customers destack to get back to kind of pre-candemic normalize inventory levels and that's really compounding kind of the near-churn issues with the call counter. In addition to sort of the market demand which obviously you know sort of has a significant impact on the business you've also got chip makers overall being caught right in the middle geopolitics you know that the export control that the Biden administration has implemented so that there's essentially a line that's cut off between the US and China at least in advance ships. Where do you think Qualcomm is positions and all of that and how much way do you put on that in terms of the headwinds the company is likely to fake? I think the impact by these latest BIS export restrictions really don't have a big impact on Qualcomm. The latest restrictions are really targeting kind of advanced computing targeting kind of data center workloads around machine learning and AI. Qualcomm plays more that consumer space right there obviously have an emerging business within automotive they do have an IoT space but there are the latest around restrictions really don't have a material impact on Qualcomm in our view. And finally you still have an overweight rating on the stock although you did cut your price target from 170 to 150 dollars a share. Looking at where the stock is today that's still more upside what do you think is going to be the catalyst that gets you there? I see a couple things right so I think in this sort of environment the investor appetite is there's an appetite for stocks that have kind of reset and de-risk kind of forward expectation. There's a handful of companies and companies that still have not seen kind of weakness yet estimates are still at historical highs but here you've had come two significant cuts to forward expectations so we think the estimates for going forward are largely de-risk. The second thing is a company has a clear line is sight to when inventories likely are going to bottom they quantify the inventory correction at roughly two billion dollars a quarter for the next two quarters but it looks like we're going to bottom in the March quarter and at which point you get back to kind of normalize run rates. And then the last thing I point out is much of the weakness that they're seeing right now are being caused by the lockdowns in China. You know at some point these rolling lockdowns have to have to cease and we think that's going to happen at some point in the first half of 2023 and we expect there to be significant pin-up demand by the the average consumer in China coming out of that. Yeah certainly a lot of companies hoping for a shift in policy especially in China and COVID. John Vin Keebank, Capital Markets, Equity Research Analyst appreciate your time today. What is time now for our chart of the day taking a look a longer look I should say and to shares of meta as a stock drop 25% last week. Now if you were one of the lucky ones who purchase shares of the tech giant five years ago it is now down around 50% over the last half decade erasing its gains from the pandemic. This comes in the same period in which the S&P 500 is up more than 40% despite the downswing for major tech companies and as investors are embracing the idea that a slowdown could go on for years we can most certainly be seeing this trend of the S&P 500 outperforming those big names like Apple and that could continue a lot of paying for those holding on to those meta shares. Coming up the CEO of Luminar Technologies tells us how he plans to be the law of the last one that comes to self-driving technology. We'll certainly want to see it for that. We'll be right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,29,2022-11-03 15:46:02
4739," MUSIC and Right? Look away хотите stock up nearly 5%. The global automotive technology company reporting revenue of nearly 30% higher from the previous quarter and up 60% year on year. Luminar Maitreya gets full your guidance as it remains on practical chief key 2022 milestones. For more on all this, we have Luminar CEO Austin Russell joining us today. Austin, it's good to talk to you. I'm going to get through the numbers in a bit, but I want to point to an announcement that someone argue kind of overshadowed the strong core that you had. Luminar's lighter equipment and software now shipping on cars made for China's largest car maker, SAIC. This certainly points to positive movements at a time where there's concerns about where self-driving is going. Talk to me about how that's progressing and what that tells you about the timeline for wider adoption. Yeah, no, I think the whole point of what we've done is that really after 10 years of innovating, coin-roads-hyping, developing, industrializing, I think we're finally making this journey into series production. This is really the first time in this industry when you see this level of technology actually make its way out of that whole moonshot R&D phase into production vehicles. It's something that we couldn't be more excited about. But yeah, it's happening. It's coming together. Of course, SAIC is the largest Chinese automaker with their day of a new fully electric brand, Kedical Rising Auto with the R7 that we're launching on, but that's just the start. Just around the corner, you have Volvo with their EX90 that they're going to be launching on actually just one week from today or sort of the one to that on November 9th. Then we also just had pole star. They just introduced the pole star three a couple of weeks ago, also featuring Luminar. All this is converging and this is just the start. Then we're safe to use a Nissan and other partners that we have. Fantastic. Let's talk about the numbers in the quarter, especially with the cash on hand. You ended the quarter with more than $550 million in cash. When you look at this spending, $150 to $200 million a year, it certainly looks like you are on track to reach profitability. Talk to me about the timeline you're looking at.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,30,2022-11-03 15:51:06
4740," spending $150 to $200 million a year. It certainly looks like you are on track to reach profitability. Talk to me about the timeline you're looking at right now for the company. Yep, so we're going to be hosting actually a Lumenard day. You know, come the first quarter of next year, we're going to outline all the details with the guards to our timeline and plans associated with becoming cash flow positive. But I think the key thing is is that we have more than enough capital at the table to be able to get that cash flow positivity with a strong buffer as well for everything that we want to do for our business and beyond. So that's that's really good. But and unfortunately in a very privileged position when it comes to capital needs and there's huge upfront capital requirements as well that's needed to make this happen in addition to of course the technology, the people, the resources, the partnerships, you know, the manufacturing, all that has to come together. But yeah, that's the we're in a great place there. Then when it comes to, you know, generating real business and revenue, this is the first time that this kind of tech is making its way into a series production for these kinds of, you know, next generation safety and autonomous capabilities and having that revenue ultimately is able to be very helpful towards building a viable business. Whereas, you know, the vast majority of autonomous vehicles really in companies are either a pre-revenue or little to no revenue for the foreseeable future. So that's a fundamental different cheaters well in terms of what we're actually able to make happen and the growth curve with the automakers. And finally, Austin, you pointed to some of the positive steps you're taking in the partnership that you have with car makers. But, you know, we've have had some setback in the autonomous driving push. We had Ford and Volkswagen most recently, you know, pulling the plug essentially on their self-driving ambitions. And I wonder where you think things are headed. I mean, was this kind of shakedown inevitable given the technology that needed to get to full autonomous driving? It's sort of the grand vision that was set out years ago in terms of where this is headed. I mean, is that still intact? Well, one, the grand vision that I think many gave in the industry is absolutely not intact. But the key distinction here is that that's a completely different world than the kind of stuff that we're doing here at Luminor. The main issue with what we've seen from a broader autonomous vehicle standpoint is that the vast majority of companies have really been focused around eliminating the driver with all-out robot taxis in urban environments. So the big bet that we made was actually not that at all. It was actually for consumer production vehicles in trucks as well. As an opportunity to be able to improve the safety of the vehicle, enhance the driver, not replace the driver altogether. And that's a key distinction here of how this is happening. And the rest of it is actually, I mean, for what it's worth, it's not any different than what I was saying a handful of years ago. I think people may just listen more now. But the reality is that that's a 10-year journey. That's a long time frame here, too. What we're doing is already starting to make its way into production cars today. It takes years worth of work and advance and a lead-up of what we've had to do to make it happen. But because of the fact that we're focused on safety, we're focused on much more constrained problems here. Getting rid of that, you know, $100,000 roof rack full of sensors and a super computer in the trunk. And now having something that can go on to production vehicles as a cleanly integrated system, that's what we think is incredibly powerful. And that's why we're seeing all this adoption by all these major automakers. And I think as the industry evolves, we're only going to see more and more people pivot towards that strategy, which ultimately ends up, you know, just as with that Argo case, ends up being more synergistic with the stuff that we're doing. Yeah, it's certainly been great to track all the progress with Luminar. Austin Russell, Luminar CEO, appreciate your time today. Thanks so much for joining us. We want to get to some breaking news here with lift. The company now announcing it plans to cut 13% of its work staff resulting in a loss of hundreds of jobs. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. It is the second round of layoffs at the company in recent months as the ride chair let go of 2% of its employees during the summer. Now, the company has more than 4,000 employees, not including its drivers. And we're going to bring you more developments on this story as they come in. We are seeing that stock down nearly 2% right now. Well, coming up,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,31,2022-11-03 15:54:38
4741," Not including its drivers, and we're going to bring you more developments on this story as they come in. And we are seeing that stock down nearly 2 percent right now. Well, coming up, more drama surrounding the Washington commanders. We're going to tell you what we are learning now about the future of that franchise. Let's move back to the break. The U.S. Attorney's Office has opened a criminal investigation into the Washington commanders for according to a report by ESPN that came at just hours after owner Dan Schneider said he will explore potential transactions involving the team. And as you said, the commanders and Dan Schneider are facing a federal investigation for financial and properties. This is kind of the latest step that Dan Schneider has had to go through in his quest to kind of keep the team. And I think as we saw yesterday with the initial report by Forbes, a conjunction with this federal investigation into the financial and properties, Dan Schneider's term as the commander's owner is definitely coming to an end. Other owners have quietly been kind of pushing for this. Even Colts, owner Jim Urce, came out and spoke out against Dan Schneider at the owners meeting a couple of weeks ago. So it was probably time for this to happen. Beyond this, there's been a litany of other scandals that the commanders have suffered through under Dan Schneider's leadership. Now it's going to be time for someone else to try to get a crack at it. And one of these, I guess it's kind of funny because Dan Schneider's punishment for going through these things, going to be getting a nice check for a solid football team, but it's about over for him. Yeah, I was going to say a lot of people lining up to see if they can make their bid for that as well. Keeping you busy, Charles McDonald, thanks so much for joining us today. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and Yahoo Finance live.

4742," Hi! The Vago are going on quite the trip today up 16% after seeing revenue in the third quarter rise 33% year over year, but warned that high interest rates and inflation will continue to impact consumer spending Travago CEO Axel he for joins us now. Axel always a pleasure to speak with you on the back of earnings here. Look let's dive into some of the results here and some of the trends that you're seeing if there's one catalyst that really sticks out to you from the quarter. What would you pinpoint? I mean the quarter shot very strong demand as we expected. We want to travel and it's a basic need from our perspective and also what we see in the pandemic and you've seen that the demand was very strong prices were strong and that is obviously a good combination for us as we compare prices. And bring it down for us a little bit Axel where you are seeing demand both geographically and in what kind of travel. Yes so the Western markets were strongest in Asia. It's obviously very very different market by market, but generally speaking the recovery has is not been as strong as in in Europe and in America's. Kind of travel. So over the place so our top destination worldwide is London so the big metropolitan attractive cities but then you've also seen in the US a lot of demand for for Orlando for an hour and so for the for the Disneyland trips family trips. So really I would say very very broad demand and all the trips that you you couldn't do during the pandemic people people wanted to do now. Axel Brian Chesky over Airbnb talks a lot about on his earnings call as night a little bit of a slow down in the holiday quarter you seem it. No I mean the the the third quarter was very strong for us. I mean what we are seeing right now that there are first signs of a change in consumer behavior which which is exactly what you would expect. I mean the inflation is hitting consumers pretty much everywhere in the Western world and what we expect for next year and we see early signs of that are basically three things. I didn't just say I wanted that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,33,2022-11-03 16:04:14
4743," Exactly what you would expect. I mean, the inflation is hitting consumers pretty much everywhere in the Western world. And what we expect for next year and we see early signs of that are basically three things. One is that people are reducing their their length of stay. So trying to save some money by by staying for one day less. And there we see some early signs in Europe in particular. You do expect people to actually go to different destinations where either transportation is cheaper or the destination overall is cheaper. And again, we start to see that in particular in Europe, or for example, Morocco is becoming more popular, which is a very attractive destination, but usually not on top of everybody's list. And then the last thing is that that you expect people obviously to compare prices more if things are getting more expensive and that's exactly what we do and we also see they are an increase in activity. What are the types of stays that you're seeing people lean into, especially as they are comparing prices. And where potentially are they beginning to push back on some of those prices. The types of trips, the top destinations are actually still very similar as I said, I mean, London worldwide in the US, New York is actually on top of the list. But we do see that people start to move away from the top and most expensive destinations to more secondary destinations to still have a good break and then to take some time off without sacrificing on the experience, but saving some money. So we're trying to just tie a lot of pieces or pieces of economic puzzle together. So we had SD Lauder hour earnings this morning noting a slowdown in travel retail and specifically called out Asia. What are you seeing in your business in terms of international travels to the US and then also in Asia specifically? It's very difficult to comment on because the situation in Asia is very different market by market. I mean, generally speaking, we see some recovery, but very different Japan, for example, we've seen a strong and strong increase in Q3, but it's difficult to comment in general. Overall, the US is obviously in a specific situation given the strength of the dollars. So traveling from the US to Europe in particular got a lot cheaper. So we see a lot more demand from US travelers for the top and most attractive European cities like London, Paris, Rome, etc. The other way around obviously got a lot more expensive and you can also see that. So I'm going to go. I mean, it's difficult to say to be honest, I think my view is somewhere in the middle. It's, I do think that that people will continue to travel and I do think that the spending for traveling next year will be up from this year. On the other hand, I also do expect travelers to cut back on the nights that they stay in hotels to save some money and to compensate for the inflation that you have on travel costs. So you're not a bad market. I mean, the market will be up next year, but not a golden market either. So moving the stock price here today in reaction to earnings here, we've seen them moving higher and holding on to some sharp games as the rest of the market is waiting for the Fed. So I'm going to go and see if you're appreciative of the time as always, Chicago CEO, Axel Hefer. Axel, thanks so much. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,34,2022-11-03 16:07:40
4744," you you you XBO now an independent company after spinning off off, it's Truckload Brokage Business RX-0. And also, we've got a new CEO for XPO. That's Mario Harrick, and he is joining us now, Mario. Full disclosure, you and I chatted a little bit last night at a reception at the NYSC following the formal spinoff here. And we, of course, have talked to Brad Jacobs, who is now stepping down as the CEO of the company, about the rationale behind what's going on. But just to take a step back, we have talked so much about the broader economic landscape. We've talked a lot about the buildup that we've seen in inventories and a lot of industries. What are you guys seeing across the country in terms of the flows of goods? Julie, it was great seeing you and thanks. Thanks for having me on. So we are seeing a softer macro this year than what we saw last year. And we're hearing mixed feedback from our customers. Today, our less than Truckload Business is two-third industrial companies. And we're seeing some of these companies having more product flow through their supply chain so they're ending up shipping more product while other are seeing softer than N. And on the retail side, it's similar feedback. Now, the said you wouldn't see it in our numbers. We delivered a great third quarter, but we delivered record EBTAA. We grew our LTL business. We delivered record revenue and record EBTAA. And we're seeing an acceleration of tonnage where we flipped, which is a measure of volume, where we flipped to positive on a year-on-year basis in September. And we expect to be positive on volume in the fourth quarter as well. Just given this backdrop, Mario, how are you investing in the business? Have you pulled back at all? We are planning for our less than Truckload Business. We are continuing to plan to invest more into the business. Over the last year, we pivoted to the next phase of our LTL business. We call it LTL 2.0, which is based on capitalizing on the high return on invested capital into our less than Truckload Business. So we're opening up more terminals. We're adding more trailers to our fleets. We're adding more trucks. And we're seeing the success of doing so. Again, we accelerated our tonnage trends at where we buck typical seasonality. And we are also bucking industry trends in terms of gaining market share as well. In those tonnage trends, is there anything that says to you that there is a spending pullback among some of the most notable consumers that you're carrying for? So today, our business is two-third industrial companies. And we call it 20%, 25% are e-commerce and retail type companies. We are seeing some customers slowing down where the consumer, for example, is buying less. But we are also seeing some retail companies having to turn through inventory to have the right type of product in their supply chain. And in that case, they are shipping more product. For the industrial companies, again, a lot of these companies through COVID had pent up demand, where now they are being able to get the product they need to fulfill open purchase orders and that's leading to more demand, while others are seeing softer demand. So currently, it's a very mixed...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,35,2022-11-03 16:12:06
4745," and that's leading to more demand, while others are seeing softer demand. So, quality is a very mixed environment, and generally the macro is softer than where it was a year ago or where it was earlier in the year, but using our own company specific initiatives who are being able to go out and gain market share by focusing on delivering great service for the customer and having capacity in our network to gain that business. Mario, what's happening on the tracker front these days? We heard a lot about the tracker shortage that even before the pandemic, right, this was something that was pretty acute in the industry. What's the status and in the industry more broadly and then for XBO specifically? The driver shortage obviously is not new to our industry and it's something that did accelerate through the pandemic. Now things are getting easier where we are now than where we were earlier in the year, just to give you an example in the third quarter, we saw an increase in applications for post-the-drag go up by 58% on a year-on-year basis. But there as well, we have a company specific initiative that I'm very proud of that helps us counter the driver shortage. We operate our own driver schools out of 130 locations. And this year we are on track to graduate more than 1700 drivers to join our rank. And it's a great career opportunity for people who join our company as dog workers and they can actually become a driver where they can make more wages and have a great career with us over the years to come. Marrow, you're following big footsteps and a big personality and Brad Jacobs. I'm convinced he's off camera there, but maybe he's not. How do you, what should investors know about you? Tell us a little bit about your story. You got it. So my background is in technology. I initially, this is where my education was, went to MIT for my engineering degrees. And since then, I used to be in the tech sector for a while, but been with XBO for the last 11 years. I was Brad's third hire on the team back in 2011. And we've been part of every decision we've made. And I've learned a ton of from Brad over those 11 years. And I look forward now to this next chapter of being CEO and look forward to the next chapter of our company that we're very excited about moving forward. You know, in that extensive kind of work history, where do you think about some of the parallels that we've seen in previous economic downturns and how you intend to lead XBO through what is the impending or anticipated next downturn? Well, we are modeling for different scenarios for next year, depending on if the macro further softens from here or if things do get better as well. Now, in our LTL business, it's, again, it's a business that has a high mode associated with it. Where you haven't had the big competitors go into less than truck load in 30 to 40 years. And that leads to strong pricing dynamics, where obviously price is a stays positive in our industry. Even in the soft market, we anticipate still having pricing power to our customers. The second area is managing variable cost. Is that if the macro thus soften, today 75% of our costs are variable based on the volume that we are moving through our network. So we would anticipate to work both efficiency angle and using leveraging our technology as well to make sure that we are managing that variable cost to the volume we're seeing in the environment. But again, I would intend to also gain market share and we're bucking typical trends and we're bucking industry trends in terms of being able to gain more market share from our customers. Well, go look at this holiday season. Go look on your CEO, Journey Looking Forward to staying in touch. XPO, CEO, Mario Harret. We'll talk to you soon.

4746," you you Welcome back take it and stride high yields low prices and hopeful outlook make an enticing entry point from municipal bond investors all spring global investments municipal bond fun portfolio manager Nick Venditti joins me and Nick municipal bonds munis they don't always capture the headlines but they have been out before we talked about this over the break here they have been outperforming bonds which have just been performing dismally this year when I say bonds I mean treasury bonds yeah they've been outperforming almost everything it turns out on the scale of one to Ryan Reynolds munis bonds are looking awfully sexy certainly on a relative basis year to date and probably on a go forward basis given some of the realities we still are facing from a fed from a geopolitical world that we're currently living in and we know that municipal bonds they have different flavors characteristics a lot of them back by income streams from their local governments or wherever it may be what's specific what's specifically what kind of flavors are you looking at here that might be better suited to investors depending on their circumstances I think there are a lot of opportunities in a huge huge market right 60,000 plus issuers across the country and by virtue of that you have a lot of diversification a lot of options to go find alpha look in a world where everyone is concerned about inflation you have munis that in some degree at least are inflation proof you know this if you own a house right when your house price appreciates the county assessor is there with a new tax bill very quickly when your house price depreciates it takes a lot longer for that that kind of like gas that's right they tend to be much stickier to the upside than they are the downside and by virtue of that muni credit looks good now and will likely look good into the future all right so we're talking about credit here it is fed day so I got to ask you about the fed expectations are for 75 basic point rate hike but are these high let's step back here from the 30 mile above the earth view are these higher rates hurting some of the local governments or as you said can they just pass these on yeah I think not yet but but ultimately it will and the reason it will is because governments are to some degree businesses right they employ a lot of people and to the extent that their employment costs go up so do their pension costs so do the costs of operating these cities in addition to that health care in this country is largely financed by munis and we all know kind of the anecdotes about how expensive it is in this world to find out what is going to happen and what is going to happen is that the government is in this world to find doctors to find nurses and that that could over time add a little bit of a weight to some of these credits what you were talking about remind me just now about 10 years ago Meredith Whitney stuck her neck out and she forecast a failure of muni municipal bonds that was going to be structural that did not material as I'm not trying to pick on Meredith Whitney here but there are some some times in history when there have been fears that municipal governments could default even if they're back by income. Streams what are the expectations of the economy and now supporting that view or not. Yeah I do think that investors need to be a little more careful in the municipal bond space than they had been in the past look the reality is is that for a long time people looked at munis as the sleep easy at night asset class that there was no risk because frankly interest rates always went down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,37,2022-11-03 16:20:37
4747," is that for a long time, people looked at munis as the sleep easy at night asset class, that there was no risk because, frankly, interest rates always went down and credits never defaulted. And credits aren't going to default at any meaningful rate, but we are facing kind of unprecedented times. We are facing municipalities with unfunded pension liabilities that are enormous. We are facing wage pressure. And so again, I'm by no means merit if Whitney, but I do think that credit risk is real. And so investors in this space need to be comfortable that their investment managers are tearing apart these issuers from the bottom up. All right. And along those lines, I'll just give you the floor here. We've got a quick time for one more. What do you want to talk about in terms of investments here if you had 60 seconds? What do you do? I buy bunies. Look, I am bullish on municipal bonds. And here I'm bullish on an absolute basis because yields are so much higher. Look, I can go out into the world today and buy bonds inside of 10 years that yield in excess of 4%. You do the tax equivalent yield on a 4%. And that gets you above six and a half close to seven. Most investors I know would happily clip 7% today, tomorrow, and frankly every day until the end of time. And if you pair that with the fact that it gets a lot pretty difficult to expect 7% equity returns over the next three, six months, given the realities we're facing, I'm talking about a low volatility asset class. I'm talking about limited duration with almost zero default rates. Munis look like a pretty sexy place to be. I, well, you might, they might be giving Ryan, Ryan Reynolds something for his money. Oh my God, I totally messed it up. But I really appreciate you stopping by here, Nick. You made municipal bonds interesting for me and our audience here. Something that doesn't always happen. We're going to have to leave it right there. Let's bring in Dennis Lockhart. He's a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of that land and getting his take on the 75 basis point height that we just got from the Fed and Dennis. I want to start here because the Fed is laying out this possible rationale for a slowdown in the pace of rate. I'm saying that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range of committee is going to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lives with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. I know you were specifically watching the language here, the change that we could potentially hear from the Fed. What's your takeaway on that statement? Well, I'm not surprised at today's rate move. I think that was everybody expected that. I am a little surprised at the inclusion in the statement of language that gives some hint of what the path of policy might be. That's a little bit unusual. I think it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,38,2022-11-03 16:25:14
4748," in the statement of language that gives some hint of what the path of policy might be. That's a little bit unusual. I think it's welcome because they're acknowledging that they're getting close to a restrictive point. And at some stage, we'll be looking a lot more tactically at whether to add further rate rises or to pause. They're signaling that they're getting into that zone. And I think that's a good thing. And of course, they want to keep their options open as much as possible. So Dennis, based on that, another evidence you're taking to account, you expect 50 next month, and then a pause in 23 or keep hiking. Depends on the data, of course. And we can't forget that. They're always going to be looking at the data and looking for some signs of progress against the inflation problem. I think it's quite plausible that they step down to 50 next month. I would even say that's likely. Then they have a meeting January 31st and February 1st and another meeting in March. I think it's a little early to project those rate hikes if they actually occur because it's going to depend on all the inflation reports and analysis they do between now and then. And Dennis, they did say they would take into account cumulative tightening as well as some of the lags that people were concerned about in the real economy showing up. The third says that they're keeping that in mind. And this was a unanimous decision. Are you surprised? Because we were hearing a little bit of dissent as to how far and how far the Fed should be going right now. Well, let's remember that the list of voters is a subset of the total committee. And so a unanimous decision on the 75 basis point increase doesn't necessarily reflect that there isn't a fairly robust debate during the meeting among those who think we should slow down and those who think they should keep at it. Perhaps raise 75 next meeting or even thereafter. So you just don't know what the discussion is. The minutes that come out in three weeks will give us a much better sense of that. But I'm not surprised that it was unanimous. I don't think anyone had a basis on which to dissent at this meeting. Dennis, two questions, Jerry. Even in this room before, I know we've asked you this in the past. But at this point, in the economic cycle, when there's so much uncertainty, when we do have five inflation prints between now and the next Fed decision, what kind of conversations do you think are going on inside the Fed? And when you take a look at inflation right now, science, that it could potentially be cooling. How confident are you that we will see significant cooling here in the coming months? Well, I tell you, I have been surprised at how persistent the inflation picture has been so far. I think it's very hard to conclude that inflation in any way is really broken to the downside, broken out to the downside. It is still a very troublesome picture when you take all of the different components into effect or into consideration. Your earlier speaker correctly said autos seemed to be softening. Perhaps shelter and housing is softening, but it's still a little bit early to draw that conclusion. I think they will be talking among themselves about messaging, and that is if they decide to step down, how do they frame that decision exactly? And it's a little bit of a tricky communication problem, I think, for Jay Powell and for his colleagues. Earlier this week, sir, BlackRock is out with the notes saying we think the Fed will only stop when the severe damage from rate hikes is clear. Do you fear severe damage? And if so, where would we see it? I've been saying now for many weeks that the more persistent inflation is, the greater the chances or probability of a recession. Simply because they have one crude tool that they're using.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,39,2022-11-03 16:29:24
4749," Inflation is the greater the chances or probability of a recession. Simply because they have one crude tool that they're using. It doesn't address every root cause of inflation. And if inflation continues, they're going to be highly tempted to continue to use that tool. So the risk of overshooting or oversteering is very definitely there. And I just think that you have to consider the possibility of a recession of some severity. I'm not sure what severity in 2023. And we know that Chair Powell had talked about pain for the US consumer, for the everyday American with this. For people who are wondering what this means for their credit card bills, how should they be bracing themselves for this period? I spoke yesterday to someone from the retail industry who gave me a sense that the consumer is already adjusting to some extent. And that most of the spending in this particular chain of stores is on essentials, not on discretionary items. And I think that's probably what's happening. The overall consumer numbers are holding up. The constitution of consumption is shifting to essentials. And I think you're going to see particularly those at the lower end of the income spectrum doing that more and more. And with more and more difficulty, frankly, if essentials continue to rise in price. And does your work like, this is your reaction to the market's reaction to this. And I know you're more of an economy guy, not so much an equity person. But when you take a look at the euphoria that we continue to see in the markets, when the Fed is still saying that they're going to raise rates. And just might not be as aggressive. Do you think a move like this is justified? Now, we'll see if it holds for the next couple of market sessions. But I think what you're seeing right now, and then the Dow's up with 202 points, is sort of a sigh of relief, many rally after a lot of suspense building up. They're not so much suspense, but let's say just building up to the decision and the announcement by the Fed. And I think what the Fed has done today, as well as has said, sort of confirms the expectations that we're already priced into the market. And the market is responding positively to having their expectations affirmed. The markets are walking through a desert surgeon for any hope that there might be water on the horizon, aren't they? Dennis Lockhart, great to have you here, sir. Appreciate that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,40,2022-11-03 16:33:59
4750," For more on the Fed's decision, let's now bring in Joanne Fini, advises Capital Management partner and portfolio manager also joining Sarah House, Wells Fargo Senior, economists, and as we're already seeing the doubt up about 340 points just on that announcement, even though we knew obviously that this was expected. So Joanne, what's your initial reaction to this? This was widely baked in at this point. Yeah, no surprise here and very little changing in the statement that we've seen so far. Clearly the big news will come with the press conference. I think there was some concession to and recognition of that growth is moderating, and I think that might suggest to the market that the end might be in sight for rate increases. We do expect another rate increase in December, potentially also in March. The Fed does have a really big challenge here trying to get this inflation under control when there are so many factors that have contributed to it from rising wages in the tight labor market. We saw some new data on that yesterday and also from continuing shortages in various parts of the economy. So the Fed has a hard problem. The market is finally recognizing that it's going to take some time to solve, but they now may be thinking, okay, next year may not be as bad as it could have been with rate increases, at least pedering out. Sarah, what do you expect to hear from Jerome Powell? So I expect that we'll still hear that he is utterly determined to bring down inflation, but I think we'll also hear a little bit of a tone that we've seen in the statement here, and that we're getting to a point where we're at more of a crossroads when it comes to policy. So the committee, of course, has already done tremendous tightening to date, so we're raising the Fed fund rate by 375 basis points in just eight months, but we need to take into account how much tightening has been done. So there's a little bit more new on some thinking in the outlook, but I think it's important to remember that even as the Fed is signaling that it might be ready or might be in a place where it can begin to slow the pace of rate. I expect that the committee is far from done for policy tightening. So when you take a look at the Dow's reaction right now, we're up just around 267 points. We were up over 300 points just a minute ago. S&P in the green Nasdaq now back in positive territory up just around four tens of a percent. The excitement that we're seeing from Wall Street is that a bit overdone at this point just given the uncertainty out there and the fact that the Fed is going to keep raising rates, it sounds like. You know, I think the Fed said something that really should have been obvious to everybody that that sort of understands how they work is they made an explicit statement that they're going to take into account the cumulative tightening that has already taken place is when they gauge how much more tightening needs to happen. Now, and of course that there will be lags and they would take those lags into account before deciding whether to tighten any further. So I mean, that should have been obvious to people, but I think that came as perhaps some reassurance to the market. And remember where we are. I mean, the market, the S&P 500, the Dow, the Nasdaq, certainly has already traded off significantly when you think about the rate increases that were signaled starting about a year ago. And I think investors, particularly long-term investors, are looking forward and they're saying, hey, stocks have become pretty inexpensive here. At some point, these rate increases are going to cease. And in fact, we have more rate increases behind us than we have in front of us so that rate increase headwind, particularly to growth stocks, is now going to be tapering off at potentially reversing as we get into the second half next year. So it's a good time potentially to buy some stocks if you're a long-term investor. And so we did see some of the balance sheet tightening stock to slow in June. How much of an indicator though is that of how far away we might be from the Fed perhaps plateauing or at least pivoting at some point? So I think we're still some ways in terms of reaching that that turmoil rate. So right now, our expectations is that we'll continue to see the Fed hiking through probably the March meeting. But I think we have to also acknowledge that inflation is quite stubborn right now. And so we're still expecting for PC inflation to be running a little bit under 4% annualized through the first half that through the first half of the year. And so I think that's going to keep the Fed on guard when it",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,41,2022-11-03 16:38:10
4751," little bit under 4% amulet through the first half of the year. And so I think that's going to keep the fed on guard when it comes to its policy stance. So still looking at a pretty tight stance of policy. And it's also not just about how far the fed ultimately takes the fed funds rate, but I think we also have to bear in mind how long the fed will keep that policy rate at such an elevated height. And Joe, as important as this day is, it's hard not to look ahead to Thursday with the CPI number. That's next Thursday. If you're Jerome Powell, what can you point to if you want to say, all right, we see inflation beginning to come down. Where? Well, you know, use car prices for one is one area. And they can go through that whole list and point to different areas where prices have come down. That's the one that consumers are probably find most understandable. And they're seeing it happen if they're in the market for cars. But there are a lot of elements in the pricing figures that are starting to come down. But the fed is also going to be aware that house prices, which are risen so much only slowly, make their way into the CPI inflation figures. And that is still a positive contributor. But if you look out six months or a year, we'll be able to anticipate that those also will start to recede. And that's, I think, why you see inflation expectations longer term still anchored around 2.5%. I'm talking longer term. And in the medium term, probably going back towards 4% next year. So, you know, there's clearly signs that the fed can point to that inflation is starting to moderate. Sarah, what do you mean just in the odds of a recession? Obviously, that is a huge concern still with Wall Street. Some of those projections have been pushed out into later next year. Where do you stand on that? Yeah, so we're expecting the US economy will enter into a recession around the middle of next year. So right now we've seen the economy stay out of it essentially because consumers are drawing down savings to continue to fund spending. We've already seen some sectors like housing effectively already in the recession, given how much we've seen new construction and sales decline. But I think as we get further out into next year and consumers increasingly running on fumes in order to spend that we think it's going to be harder to maintain the growth and environment that we've had. So we're already seeing labor demand begin to edge down. So we're expecting hiring to slow. And that's further going to weigh on real disposable income among households at the time when inflation while moderating still remains very high and is keeping real income from actually growing. And Joanne, you've called this a market of contrast. In terms of what investors should own, is they're trying to make sense of some of the stickier parts of inflation versus some of the parts that are going down. How do you approach this if you're an investor? Yeah, this is a really unusual setup if we do end up in recession, which isn't looking increasingly likely. It doesn't look uniform at all. We still have some parts of the economy that are expanding. Car production, for example, still facing shortages from the chip side. Services still trying to find enough labor to operate. And so when you look as an investor, you have to be able to distinguish which parts of the economy are going to be hit the most by inflation. And that primarily is where inflation bites the most, which is really the mid to lower end consumer, which is really going to feel that pinch. So it's going to be challenging potentially for sort of mid-range retail and mid-range restaurants to keep drawing in those customers. But the bargain opportunities, where am I going to shop the save money at TJ Maxx or a target? You know, after they've now cleared out their inventories and stocked the right stuff, they could be real opportunities. And we like those two stocks particularly. And then you have to look at the luxury brands. Some of them continuing to do well. You have to watch the inventory situation. But the high end consumer really isn't going to feel the pinch so much from this inflation. Gas, food, the small proportion of their budget expenditures. So they're not going to be hurt that much. So really is a time to pick and choose where to go. Favorite the luxury consumer retail markets and really stay away from the mid-range where folks or companies are likely to see a fall off in their foot traffic as folks go bargain shopping at a place like TJ Maxx.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,42,2022-11-03 16:42:32
4752," you you you prem ще language surprise you in particular the mention of the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. Well, I thank you and all the prior guests who just spoke before me are focusing on the right things. That the addition of that language elevated the importance of the idea that when you get closer and closer to a destination, you slow down just like when you're driving a car. And that's what they're telling us. The the the the knowledge of the lags, the cumulative tightening that's in the pipeline. The signal is clear they're getting closer to their pause. It'll probably be early to mid 2023 call it 475 or 5. And then they have to stop and wait to see the cumulative impact of the tightening. The fact that the bond market is reacting with the steepening where two and five or yields or double digits richer makes some sense. This new language I think for closes at least for now the concern that they're going to keep going 75. And I think it affirms expectations that were built off of recent FOMC members speeches and appearances that this day was coming. This idea of slowing the pace and getting closer to the pause. But RJ when we're getting closer to a destination, I'm looking down to my GPS and I'm seeing the time go down 10 minutes or so. We're not seeing that in inflation. We're still at a 40 year high. What evidence in there is there that we are closer to the destination, which is 2%. I'm going to stay with the car analogy. If you are going to drive your car by looking solely in your rearview mirror, you will hit a wall or another car. That's what the Fed would be doing if they looked solely at CPI and PCE realized past inflation while driving the car of monetary policy is the economy moves forward. They need to look forward and anticipate it's undeniably clear that monetary policy is not instantaneous mortgage rates have surged. But other interest rates sensitive sectors are only now starting to feel the pain, the cumulative impact of a sharp and aggressive tightening that is already underway. They need to look through the windshield as to where the car is going. Lags take time to overcome. We cannot set policy solely on realized past inflation. The Fed is heartened by the way by the fact that inflation expectations are all pretty much south of 3% whether you look at tips or you look at surveys. So they are acting in a manner that keeps those expectations relatively contained and they can't set policy solely on realized inflation. It's like driving a car looking solely in the rearview mirror.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,43,2022-11-03 16:46:47
4753," see solely on realized inflation. It's like driving a car looking solely in the rear view mirror. So, Ajayvan, in terms of what we saw with Q3 real GDP, obviously we know that the Fed is data-dependent, but with so many different indicators pointing in different directions here. What does this mean for not just the likelihood of a recession, but how deep of a recession we might be headed for? Q3 GDP was an upside-by surprise propelled heavily by the surge in exports in the drop in imports. The post-pandemic world has been dominated by heterogeneous re-opening all kinds of distortions to global trade patterns. Who actually thinks exports are going to keep growing in a double-digit rate? Very few people. The economy is slowing in China. The economy is likely going to be in a recession in Europe. Global growth is slowing. Our exports are not going to continue to expand that pace. If you ex-out the impact of trade and government spending from the Q3 GDP release we just had, it was 0.1 percent at an annually, a seasonally adjusted annual rate, 0.1. That wasn't that strong of a GDP print. The underlying internals when you ex-out traded particular as well as government spending are weaker. The midterms are coming up. Government spending is not going to be surprising to the upside when we have divided government with Republicans controlling perhaps the House and the Senate, certainly the House. Are Jay, certainly when you take a look at the market direction, they're not waiting for the press conference just in terms of how they are interpreting this additional sentence that was put into the statement. But when we look ahead to that press conference from Fed Chair Jay Powell, what are you hoping to hear? What will you be listening for over the next 45 minutes or so? The new language that we've all been talking about is going to get questions from the media that's assembled in the room there. They're going to want to drill down for further meaning there. It's a challenge that Chairman Powell faces getting in front of them at any session, but he actually has a unique challenge now. This language, which I think was unanimous across all the voters, suggests that they're opening the door to the pause. It's not right away, but we're getting close to our destination, as I said before. There's going to be a lot of questions about how the market should interpret that new language. Why was it put in there? Clearly the committee on a unanimous basis feels like if it belongs there. Can Chairman Powell still sound hawkish on inflation while acknowledging the need for a pause and not open the door to a huge rally? Former President Law Card mentioned it earlier. It's a tough act. It's not an easy task to communicate such subtleties to the markets, which often trade on soundbites. There's the risk that he gets up there and tries to talk back or walk back the language in the statement. That seems like a low risk. I think he may elaborate on it in a way that will get further bullish response from potentially equities and from the intermediate part of the Treasury curve, for example. So then, RJ, on behalf of investors, if you were in that room with Jay Powell, what would you want to ask him? Interestingly enough, I think that the bigger questions come down to quantitative tightening, the Fed's plans with respect to the balance sheet. They've made their pace of balance sheet reduction abundantly clear. But there's plenty of talk, including talk at the Treasury Department, of the need to sort of bolster liquidity. Bond volatility both implied and realized volatility has been extraordinarily high this year and liquidity conditions have likely something to do with that. I'd be interested to see what Fed staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York working with the Treasury. What they're thinking about, what measures could be taken to allow the balance sheet to shrink, to be consistent with the overall monetary tightening. But to do so in a way that might be less disruptive to the functioning of the marketplace. RJ Gallow, always great to have you. Federated her knees. A senior portfolio manager. Thanks so much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,44,2022-11-03 16:51:19
4754," you youclass want to bring in the great hill of Capitol chairman. We have Thomas Hayes joining the show here to help us break down what we just heard from a Fed chair Jay Palantum and you take a look at those headlines trying to walk that very fine line not trying to sound too hawkish also didn't want to sound too dovish. Do you do a good job? A fair job. I think to Dave's point it's you know equity bulls looking for a drink in the desert. He didn't give us much water that's for sure but he did leave on the table the possibility of a downshift in December from 75 to 50 or the next meeting. So so the point is that the pace will be slowing at some point even if the terminal rate is going to be higher so we came into this meeting thinking the terminal rate might be about 4.6 to 5. Coming out of this I do think that the downshift will be a positive thing I think the markets will take 24 hours to digest this and then we'll start to look company by company but if you look at the seasonality that we're going into right now we do have the election coming up and that's coming up very very shortly. The average return for the S&P in the 12 months following a midterm election is 18.6%. So he's trying to throw cold water on it. He has left the downshift you know he came out to the cumulative tightening he's going to take that into account he's going to take into account the lag and then he completely through cold water on it with the it's premature to pause. So it's kind of double talk here I think on balance we've got two more CPI prints before the December meeting we have the jobs report unfortunately the Joltz report was a little hot yesterday so we're not expecting miracles from the jobs report on Friday 200,000 non-farm payrolls if it comes in hotter than that markets going to price in 75 in December pretty quickly if it comes in light then maybe that that downshift still is on the table. And there's no real indication that that CPI number on Thursday is going to be any better we haven't seen I mean yes use cars we can see he reiterated the labor market is a big problem what else did we learn today that we didn't know an hour ago yeah the labor market is definitely running hot I mean we were just talking about restaurants in Connecticut you can't get a you know reservation at a good restaurant in Connecticut so so the economy continues to run hot labor markets hot inflation's hot I know that there have been major speakers come out say owners equivalent rent is miscalculated it's going to take nine months to show up in the inflation numbers we agree with that the question is is the Fed willing to wait and look through the wind shield versus the rearview mirror and right now they're looking a lot through the rearview mirror and not maybe enough through the windshield I think a good model to look at where we are right now is in 1948 post-World War 2 when we borrowed a lot of money for the war to fight a visible enemy debt to GDP got to 120 percent they ran inflation above trend for about three to five years three to five percent and that ratio dropped from 120 down to 63 in just five years",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,45,2022-11-03 16:55:28
4755," percent. They ran inflation above trend for about three to five years, three to five percent, and that ratio dropped from 120 down to 63 in just five years. So we might have to run inflation above trend. He did acknowledge long-term inflation expectations remain anchored. If you look at five-year inflation break-even, they're at 265. So they're getting close to the target. And Chair Powell has reiterated he's very concerned about expectations more than actual inflation. So so long as that long-term expectation stays anchored, we could start to see the down shifts that that we've been looking for. If not in December, certainly in the following meeting. And as some investors are looking through the tea leaves here, we know that Jay Powell has asked about the three-month yields, talking about the inversion getting close, not there yet, though. He did say that although it's his preferred measure, they are going to monitor it, but he did seem quite tight-lipped on that. What are your expectations about what the yield market is telling us? Well, you know, you initially saw bonds get bid on the news that they were going to actually pay attention to lagged effect of monetary policy. And by the time he finished the press conference we're basically unchanged, the dollar sold off huge. Initially when we saw we're going to take into effect the cumulative tightening and we're going to take into effect the lags. Now the dollar is just off a little bit. So basically we're unchanged here. He came out way more hawkish in the press conference than in the original statement. So the market didn't love that, but like all of these Fed meetings what we usually find is the first move is often the wrong move. So give it a day to digest. I think it's people say, you know, it's very rare where we come to the table and we say the economy's strong. This is really bad news. What are we going to do about it? So I think it's a mix here. You know, if you look at earnings for this this quarter, you know, they're up 2.1%. They were expected to be up 2.8%. You back out energy. They were actually negative 0.6%. So he is destroying demand. If you look at the GDP for Q3, you know, plus 2.7. If you back out the exports, which was a lot of energy and petroleum products, you actually had negative GDP. So their policy they have to start to acknowledge that it is working on a lag basis. We started in March. You know, negative GDP that in actuality that would be the third negative GDP quarter. If you backed out exports with earnings coming in slightly lower than expected. So these things are working on a lag basis and the fact that he kept that downshift on the table, I think is that drink of water in the desert Dave. So what if we don't see that downshift though because there's already been criticism out there that the Fed has been way too hawkish up until this point. This was the fourth 75 basis point hike in a row. How did say he doesn't have a sense that the Fed has overtightened or that they have moved too fast. Are you at all concerned that they have been too aggressive up until this point? I do think when all of a sudden done they'll find that they've been too aggressive and they'll have to pivot and actually start to cut sometime in 2023. If we've seen throughout history, it's always the case that they overtighten. The question is how much they're going to look through the rearview mirror and how much they're going to look through the windshield. And right now they're solely looking through the rearview mirror. And the reason the market initially rallied was that they said, okay, we will take into effect the lag basis but then they discounted it completely. So I think when you look at the seasonality of the market, look, if the data comes in strong, it means the economy is strong. The market here at a multiple of 16.3 versus the 18.5 for the last 10 years, a lot of this bad news is priced in. You know, the NASDAQ down 30%, S&P still down 18%. We have priced in a decent-sized recession at this point, but stock selection and sector selection is going to be critical. You can't just say wholesale all-in, risk on. You really have to look case by case moving forward. Okay, RJ Gallimay, the same reference. Look through the windshield and not the rearview mirror. Fine, you look through the windshield and tell me how they can even begin to consider pausing. Yeah, well, based on what data? Well, I think first and foremost, you look at commodities. They completely rolled over since June. So that's going to be felt in the economy. You do see the GDP numbers. Basically, if you net out exports, you're looking at three consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. That's material. You look at earnings coming in lower than expected. You back out energy, you got negative earnings growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,46,2022-11-03 16:59:55
4756," Out exports, you're looking at three consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. That's material. You look at earnings coming in lower than expected. You back out energy. You got negative earnings growth year on year. This is only going to accelerate. What would be nice is to see some back off in the CPI numbers, some of the inflation prints between now and December to give them cover. They really need cover. They can't say we're going to predict that the CPI numbers are going to come down in six months. Therefore, we're going to pause. Give them something to hang their hat on, whether it doesn't appear that it's going to be the jobs report on Friday after the jolt. But we've got four major prints between now and December. Maybe they don't downshift in December. Maybe it is the meeting afterwards. But he did effectively toggle and say, if not December, then the meeting thereafter, in which case people can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And the terminal rate, maybe it's not 4.6, maybe it's five. But so long as inflation expectations, the five-year break even stay anchored at 2.6, I think they'll be able to downshift sooner than everyone thinks, and certainly in the first quarter of next year. Nazou, and talking about the losses accelerating down now off 351 points Nasdaq off a nearly 3 percent. Right, Tom Hayes? Thanks so much for joining us in the studio. In this episode of influencers, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Capitalism at its core, what we're talking about when we talk about that, is the absolute pursuit of profit at all human environmental and social costs. A lot of these price increases are potentially due to just straight price gouging by cooperation. We are talking about a catastrophic development for millions. Hello everyone and welcome to influencers, I'm Andy Sirwer. And welcome to our guest, Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Representative, nice to see you. Thank you, thank you so much. I know you want to talk about student debt and some other issues as well, but before we get to that, I want to ask you about inflation and interest rates and Fed share Powell, who recently said that the strong labor market made it appropriate for him to soon raise interest rates. I wonder what your take on that is. Well, I think particularly when we have this conversation in the context of inflation as well, it's really not just labor, it's not just rising wages, but there's a lot of different dynamics that I think are contributing to the increase in prices, whether it's supply chain complications. Yes, labor issues, but sometimes lack of labor, a lack of the ability to be able to work consistently in their jobs, which is also tied to pandemic controls. And also there's a real distinction to be made between inflation and price gouging. And there's a lot of evidence that particularly industries with high concentrations, corporate concentrations, whether it's almost oligopoly level industries, a lot of these price increases are potentially due to just straight price gouging by corporations. Are you concerned about inflation and higher interest rates and the impact on working people? I mean, wherever prices are increasing and it's making it difficult for someone to be able to feed their family, that is always going to be a major point of concern, a primary point of concern. But the real key is making sure that we're diagnosing the causes correctly because the danger here is that if we say we're helping working people too much and say that the cause of this is, oh, it's because we provided too much assistance during the American Rescue Plan stimulus checks were too generous. That is why we are dealing with the problems that we're dealing with now. What that's going to result in is a pullback in the assistance that some families need the most right now. And when we already talk about the cessation of the child tax credit, we're dealing with",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,47,2022-11-03 17:04:11
4757," Resultant is a pullback in the assistance that some families need the most right now. And when we already talk about the cessation of the child tax credit with the failure to pass the Billback Better Act before the end of last year, we really need to be very careful about diagnosing these issues correctly. Because on the flip side of that coin, if we say there are real antitrust issues here, there's a lot of corporate abuse of power leading to price gouging, then that allows us to pursue lanes such as antitrust and also pursue labor protections, COVID protections that can help people get back into the workplace and stay safe in the workplace. Right, so you are seeing those who are suggesting that it's because of the assistance that people had during COVID that that's inflationary and therefore we need to swing the pendulum back. Yeah, and I couldn't disagree more. Right. I couldn't disagree more with that assessment. Student loan debt. And I know you've called repeatedly for the President Biden to forgive student loan debt. Why hasn't that happened? And what do you think will happen if the pause that exists presently is allowed to lapse? Well, I cannot understate the danger and the risk economically, politically and just where we are right now is a country of allowing the moratorium on student loan payments to lapse in May. If we just allow a full just continuation of student loan payments, we are talking about a catastrophic development for millions, the over almost 50 million student loan borrowers in this country. There were millions of student loan borrowers that were already defaulting going into the pandemic. But more than that, we are at such a delicate point in the financial and just general economic recovery post-COVID that to then restart payments that are essentially the size of a mortgage payment, sometimes even larger on a generation that was already so devastated, not just by this, but the recession, et cetera. I believe it could throw out of balance already what is a very fragile recovery. And not only that, but this forgiveness is on, I mean forgiveness is the just thing to do. It's the right thing to do. Why the President hasn't done it yet? I'm not sure, but I do think that this is an issue of increasing urgency. He has already indicated an openness to it and he has actually already used his authority to forgive student loan debt in certain small, very narrow cases. Because there are people who suggest he doesn't have the authority, is that a legitimate argument or just maybe a smoke screen? I don't think it's a legitimate argument. We've seen, in fact, we've seen him use the same legal authority that the President has used to suspend student loan payments is the same authority that he would use to cancel them. And not only that, but he has used that authority. He has indicated a willingness to use the authority. And I think that it would be extraordinarily important, an urgent for him to do so. And what about the argument that it's a moral hazard? In other words, you're letting people off the hook by forgiving the debt? Well, what I think is the true moral hazard here is the surging costs of education in the United States. What is actually created the moral hazard is this guarantee of saying we will issue minors, hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt at almost any level with almost no limit. And we will allow colleges and universities to dramatically increase the cost of their tuition with the guarantee of that loan value on 17-year-olds. So what is the actual true moral hazard here in the situation? Is the controls on the cost of educational United States? And one very important control in this to that note is tuition-free public colleges and universities. Because then what that does is that it introduces competition into the market to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,48,2022-11-03 17:08:28
4758," To that note is tuition-free public colleges and universities. Because then what that does is that it introduces competition into the market, to which private universities have to actually meet a lower baseline. But, you know, people act as though it's just fancy public schools that are extremely expensive now. But public college tuition has also increased dramatically and far beyond the pace of inflation. You you you you you You have a huge social media following obviously in a big platform have you been either surprised by how much or how little influence that affords you in Congress in other words how does that translate representative? You know that's an interesting question I think it's the way that I've thought about it I go first going into office and then continuing is that there are a lot of in Washington a lot of different sources of power there are some members who have extraordinary connections to different powers players different power centers that are very well connected and networked there are other individuals who are very frankly financially connected industry lobbyists corporations throw their weight and donate and give their influence their lobbyists et cetera throw an enormous amount of their support behind other members of Congress so every single member kind of has their assets that they lean on and for me I decided early on because I don't accept money from corporations",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,49,2022-11-03 17:12:51
4759," kind of has their assets that they lean on. And for me, I decided early on because I don't accept money from corporations. I do not take meetings with lobbyists. I am not well connected. I don't come from a well connected family or community or anything like that. That my ability to navigate and advocate is going to have to be squarely rooted in relying on everyday people and their support and my ability to communicate with them what is going on in Washington. It's an interesting perspective. You self-identify as a democratic socialist and have called capitalism irredeemable, I believe. But what does that really mean? And does that mean capitalism should be eliminated and are your views compatible with capitalism? Well, I believe that in a broad sense because when we toss out these big words, capitalism, socialism, they get sensationalized and people translate them into meaning things that perhaps they don't mean. So to me, capitalism at its core, what we're talking about when we talk about that, is the absolute pursuit of profit at all human, environmental, and social cost. That is what we're really discussing. And what we're also discussing is the ability for a very small group of actual capitalists and that is people who have so much money that their money makes money and they don't have to work. And they can control industry. They can control our energy sources. They can control our labor. They can control massive markets that they dictate and can capture governments and they can essentially have power over the many. And to me, that is not a irredeemable system for us to be able to participate in, for the prosperity and peace, for the vast majority of people. So people talk about stakeholder capitalism, like Larry Fink at BlackRock, where the waiting for different constituents besides shareholders is more equal. Is that something you'd be amenable to? Well, I think at the end of the day, it's who it is about who has control over the very core assets of production in society. If it ultimately comes down to a billionaire or the Koch brothers or the Koch family, having control over the vast majority or large plurality of our oil assets in the United States, if it's a handful of very wealthy families having control over, private families having control over means of production, that is essentially the capitalist system that we live in. It is a small group that is of privatized control over what we eat and how we fuel our society. Now, where we can transition to, and there are certain ideas where we're talking about, for example, Elizabeth Warren has discussed about workers being elected to the boards, governing boards of companies, and also we're here in the Bronx. I represent a community that has the largest concentration of worker cooperatives in one of the largest concentrations in the world. Now, these are alternative ways of doing business. Free markets are not the same thing as capitalism, and you can have markets where businesses and ways of producing, trading, selling goods are really controlled and not just controlled, but given more power to workers, people get a fair shake, union jobs, unionized workplaces. All of these are different steps and levels that we're talking about in a more just economy. Congress people trading stocks. You have come out calling for a ban here, and there seems to be some momentum, but I wonder why this seems to be such a difficult thing to pass, and is Speaker Pelosi a roadblock here? Well, you know, it's not really a mystery to me, why it's difficult to pass. In an enormous amount, I wouldn't be surprised.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,50,2022-11-03 17:17:11
4760," It's not really a mystery to me, why it's difficult to pass. In an enormous amount, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a majority of members of Congress hold and trade individuals stock. I don't know the actual numbers, but it is a very large degree. And you know, the key here is that it's not to say that you can't have a retirement fund or a college savings account. Or a blind trust fund. A blind trust, a mutual fund, an index fund. These are vehicles of investments that are broad. That individual members of Congress don't have direct control over. But even last year, there was at least 75 members of Congress that held individual stock in Johnson & Johnson, Viderna and Pfizer. And we're talking about in the last one to two years. And so that is where we should be drawing the line. I am a member of Congress. Members of Congress have access to very sensitive, security clearances. We have access to very detailed, tailored briefs. Our job is to try to anticipate and legislate for what we see is coming. And we should not have the ability to both have access to that information and be able to hold and trade individual stock. And that's really what this is about. It's about our ability to direct and hold trades in individual stock with access to the sensitive information that the public has given us. Voting rights reform. Is that a dead issue? It's tied to the filibuster, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Sinema, come out against it. What does your take on where that stands? You know, this is, I think, one of the top level questions and issues that we have before us in Congress. I very much believe that we are at the precipice of a return to Jim Crow style laws across the country. We are already seeing these wheels of motion, attempts in Texas and Georgia, across many different states, attempts at voter suppression. And frankly, what Senators Manchin and Sinema fail to recognize and what is disappointing and sad to see is how a historic their stances have been throughout this debate. you you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,51,2022-11-03 17:21:18

4762," on the cases I believe right there in and of itself as to why they should be subject to antitrust activity. I want to ask a couple of personal questions about you. I'm teaching a Columbia this semester and one of my students Penny Ramirez-Bernandez wanted me to ask you, how did being a waitress help you understand the American economy is successes and failures? Well, I mean, I believe that my time as a waitress is the most politically formative experience that I had. It's that along with just growing up in a working class family, experiencing just the ravages of the great recession, almost losing our home, all of that, but particularly the years that I spent working in restaurants. The thing about restaurants is that it is, it really is such a crucible of so many different public policies. I worked alongside undocumented workers. I didn't have health insurance. I tried to buy Obamacare, you know, the ACA Affordable Care Act. I actually used and relied on the policies that were coming out of Washington. And I worked, you know, I was a Senate intern back in college. I got an economics degree. I worked in public policy spaces. I also had worked for nonprofits. There is a ocean of a difference between the white papers and the policy you see on paper and how it's experienced by everyday people. And unless you actually go on to the exchange and try to buy health care for yourself and use that health care and understand how it's serving you and how it's not serving you, it's very difficult to understand why so many people are frustrated by otherwise well-meaning, sometimes democratic policy. As a former dishwasher, I can relate. So I want to ask you maybe a kind of funny question about the moniker AOC. So is that when your friends and family call you or how did that sort of evolve? When did you become AOC? I actually think it's funny enough. AOC really emerged after I won my primary. And I think there were a lot of pundits on television that were kind of like stumbling because my name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It was the news story after I won my primary. It was so sudden. And there were just all these folks on TV that I think were kind of like struggling to say my name that it actually started coming from TV. And so in the past, there were some folks that would sometimes say it jokingly, but it was never a nickname that stuck. But I think it actually kind of came from media pretty overnight. But my friends don't call me that. The folks that I organize with. Do they call you Alexandria? They'll call me Alexandria or they'll call me Alex. My friends will call me Alex. But yeah, it's a, you know, it's shorthand, but I now embrace it, welcome it, except it. And final question, maybe it's too early in your career to ask this, but I'm going to ask anyway, how do you see your legacy going forward? You know, I always feel like I actually think that it is important for young people to ask themselves questions of legacy very early. And I think the reason that that's important is because we shouldn't root our legacy in a position or a job or a role, but we should really root it in a mission of what we want to do qualitatively and how we want to be remembered. And I don't think it's ever too early to consider that because it helps us make decisions, it helps us root us in our values and our morals. And I just hope that for me, you know, what I do and what my community understands and receives and feels from me as their representative is someone that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,53,2022-11-03 17:30:08
4763," You know, what I do and what my community understands and receives and feels from me as their representative is someone that always puts the people of this country first that doesn't allow herself to be dissuaded or distracted by power, influence, etc. and that we are dissuaded and relentless and honest and authentic in our pursuit for a better world. And that, you know, that in that pursuit, we just tell it as it is and try to do everything we can in every moment that we can. And I think that's pretty much it. That's it. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Thank you so much for your time. Of course, thank you so much. You've been watching Influencers. I'm Andy Sirwork. We'll see you next time. Thank you. Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Sousy alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Right now we're seeing all three major indices deeply in the red. But, Julie, let's go over to you. Some breaking news on the economy. Yes, we have the services engaged from the Instoe Supply Management coming in at the slowest pace since May of 2020. 54.4 was the reading 56.7 was what it was in September so it declined there obviously. This is a little better than estimated. 53.3 is what economists was looking for and above 50 does signal expansion. So unlike the S&P global read that we got just a moment ago this is a different slicing and dicing and is one that looks a little bit better. We did see measure of business activity within the index declining to a five month low. The new orders component of this falling to the lowest level since June and the prices paid in in the index part of this is increased and does remain elevated. So still seeing not a terrible picture here but not a fantastic one either that prices paid component to 70.7 from 68.7 so all of this indicates that we still have expansion in the services part of the economy but we're seeing a slowdown in that expansion. And look you saw the market come back just a little bit this a market that may just just wants to reward any data that misses. Maybe. I saw that. I knew you could do that. Oh and we should also mention we just got mortgage rates in the last a few moments as well the new data from Freddie Mac showing that we saw now a redip under 7% it was above 7% last week when we got this 30 year number now it is 6.95% that is the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac. I mean whether it's a little bit above 7 or a little bit below. As the man says it's too damn high as the man says about the rent anyway so watching that as well as a continuing headwind. Indeed and we're taking a look at the major averages to see how they're reacting to the economic data the debt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,54,2022-11-03 17:34:50
4764," and says about the rent anyway. So watching that as well as a continuing headwind. Indeed, and we're taking a look at the major averages to see how they're reacting to the economic data, the Dow Jones industrial average, about 33 minutes into trade is lower. By 324, 327-ish points there, one point to the downside right now, the NASDAQ composite you're seeing that down by about 1.7% on the day, 177 points in negative territory. And the S&P 500, you're also taking a look at some red on the screen there. It's down to the tune of nearly 50 points, 1.3% in the red. Let's take a look at some of the other major moves that we're tracking here on the day. And I wanted to pull up a pharma and the broader healthcare space as well here, and perhaps I'll put this on an equal market rating just so we could actually see some of the names here. Sigma had reported on the day that reported earlier this morning, moving higher on the earnings report by about 1.5%, and of course we've broken down some of the other major earnings reports that have come out today as well to the tune of Moderna. You heard that earlier. And so now let's just take a quick look at where some of the sector activity is continuing to move. And it's actually deeper in the red from when we last checked in on it. Take a look at, and this is over the past two days. So let's just put this on the right scale here. In today, we are seeing technology sector now down 2.4% at this point in time. And so continuing to see that decline or energy, just barely creeping into the green there up by a fraction of a percent, 310th there. Well, the Fed staying the course, and it's aggressive fight against inflation with another rate hike. The move set to further dampen markets and make mortgages and other loans less attractive. For a look at how this is going to affect your personal investments, let's turn to Catherine George, Wellstream Advisors, Senior Advisor. All right, Catherine, take us into your reaction yesterday after the commentary from Fed Chair Jay Powell, the decision from the FOMC and how the markets are digesting this as well. I mean, we've been seeing this for a while, right? They've let us know that this rate height was coming and the market price that an a while ago. You know, maybe there's some short-term noise here, but we were expecting this. Maybe we weren't expecting to hear that in 2023, that could be additional rate rises, which is why the market is probably reacting the way that it is. But, you know, we've been through this economic cycle before. It's not that unexpected and the stock market, the bond market, will all come back. And it's actually a great thing for the bond market, but, you know, happy to go into stocks bonds, whatever you're most curious about. Well, let's talk about the bond market. Let's linger on the bond market, if you will, a little bit. It hasn't been a great time for the bond market thus far this year, right? And you've got both stocks and bonds that have been losing on the year, which is an unusual occurrence. As you said, you know, we've seen this environment before. That particular piece of it is not so common. So how do you navigate through that for your clients? You're right. And, you know, in the bond market, it's a little bit different in the stock market and that the price today doesn't matter all that much as long as you stay invested. You know, the bonds we've bought last year become less valuable, because a new bond will pay you a higher coupon rate. But as long as you hold on to that bond that we've bought last year, you're still going to get the same coupon payment that they promised you, and you're still going to get your principal back in maturity. So, you know, that's the one thing. But once those bonds start to mature, you're actually going to be able to buy much more attractive bonds at higher rates. And it's going to be, you know, much healthier for your overall portfolio, especially for those investors that have a decent portion of bonds. Let's say you're headed for retirement or you're in retirement. You're actually going to start to be able to earn a decent return on that portion of the portfolio, whereas, you know, the past 10 years, we haven't seen that. So, it's actually a good, good future outlook for the bond market. It's just a waiting game. Catherine, as we're seeing today, the market does not like when the Fed comes out here and suggests that rate hikes are going to continue for the foreseeable future. Having said that, is there anywhere, anywhere an investor can hide out in this volatile environment? You know, hiding out is, it's a tricky thing. So, the first thing I'd say is don't overreact, right? Stay invested, keep your stocks and bonds where they are and don't overreact. But I think the biggest thing is the cash, right? We're finally able to earn some return on our cash. If you're uncomfortable with putting any of your extra cash in the market right now,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,55,2022-11-03 17:39:03
4765," The biggest thing is the cash rate, where we're finally able to earn some return on our cash. If you're uncomfortable with putting any of your extra cash in the market right now, then make sure you're getting some sort of a return on that, you know, online bank accounts are offering about 3% right now just to sit in cash. And treasury bills, I mean, you get a six month treasury bill for 4.5% right now. That's a very liquid, you know, market, 4.5% is great. So that's that's one option. But really, if you're feeling like you can take a little bit of risk right now and you have extra cash on top of your emergency reserve, and maybe a little bit extra if you have a job that you're worried about and spending or session. But if you have some extra cash, stocks are on sale. You know, they it's actually a really good time to put some long term money away, as long as you can stomach kind of the the ups and downs of the market. You know, even with today's move lower, we're not sitting at the the lows in terms of this larger kind of downtrend that we've seen for the major averages and the markets more broadly here. Do you believe that a recession has been priced in at least at the bottom end of where we've kind of seen the activity take place over the past few months? Yeah, so I can tell you that I think everyone is expecting a recession and that's like likely priced in. Are we at the bottom? I have no idea. But if we look back to 2008, 2009, you know, behind the time the recession was actually announced, the stock market was already on the way back up. So, you know, recessions are backward looking and as we all know, stock markets are forward looking. So while they're related, you know, if the recession comes out in three months, that doesn't mean our portfolios are going to drop another 20%. You know, everyone is already thinking about this. It's been in the news for the past year. So yeah, I think it's already priced in. I just, you know, we just don't know if it's going to drop a little bit more than any time. Katherine George, Wealthtreme, advisors, senior advisor. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks for having me. All right. Before we head to break, let's check in on shares of Elf Cosmetics after the poor quarter from S.D. Lauder on Wednesday. Elf put up put on its best face on the third quarter, topping profit estimates by 20 cents on the back higher prices and consumers trading down to 10%. The cheaper lip gloss and face scrubs, company lifted its full year sales guides to 22% to 24% from 14% to 16% previously. Jeffries, Alice Ashley, Helgans, notes that Elf is gaining shelf space at Target and Walmart ahead of the holiday shopping season as well. Elf won the show. Elf on the shelf. Go up. Very nice. That's a home run, Brad. Coming up, we'll speak with the CFL of Cheg. On the back of that earnings report, they sent the stock price exploding higher. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,56,2022-11-03 17:43:33
4766,". Let's get down to business now. Take a look at some of the other headlines we're watching. Food delivery service Instacart will pay out its first company wide cash bonus in December that's according to the Well Street Journal. That move aims to boost employee morale among its corporate team during the holidays following the company's decision to delay its public offering, the mid-tightening economic conditions. The move also signals a shift in its employee retention plans. The San Francisco-based company has historically given out equity rewards to keep workers. Amazon's executive chair Jeff Bezos and the two LLCs he uses to manage his investments and properties, they're being sued by former Housekeeper Mercedes-Marcetti's WADA. The woman who identifies as Hispanic claims she was subject to racial discrimination by Bezos' staff and also forced to work long hours in unsanitary conditions without rest or breaks, which led her and other Housekeeper, she says in the suit, to develop urinary tract infections. WADA has worked for wealthy and high-profile families for 18 years with no issues according to her lawyers. Meanwhile, lawyers representing Bezos' LLC say the claims have no merit. For Mercedes-CEO, Leslie Moonvez and CBS owner Paramount reached a $30.5 million settlement with the Office of New York's Attorney General, LaTisha James. The state alleged that Moonvez concealed multiple sexual assault allegations from regulators, shareholders, and the public for months. Moonvez stepped down in 2018 following those allegations. Paramount will pay $28 million to the state, 22 million of which will go back to CBS shareholders and 6 million to strengthen mechanisms for investigating sexual harassment claims. Moonvez himself must pay $2.5 million, which will also go to CBS shareholders. Thanks so much Julie. While homework helper, Cheg, they aced their third quarter and boosted its full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA as college enrollment begins to stabilize here a little bit more. Cheg's chief financial officer, Andy Brown joins us now. Andy, thanks so much for taking the time and helping us run through the quarter. If you've got to think of one catalyst that really sticks out to you within the business from this past period, what is that? Yeah, it's been an interesting 12 months for Cheg. And as you had mentioned, things we're seeing in the headwinds that we saw maybe a year ago have now stabilized. As far as catalysts with respect to Cheg, I mean, one of the things that we have been doing is pushing what I'll call offering our premium price option. We call the Cheg Study Pack. And we continue to see a great momentum there, adding more value to the study pack and more of our students are taking that premium price option. And that's had a very nice impact on not just our revenue growth, but our earnings. And as you saw in our report, we blew through our earnings and we raised our guidance quite significantly. When we think of the past two years, it's really changed the way that a lot of colleges, universities might think about where people can be educated from, how they can be educated, what type of opportunities that create for Cheg, even in kind of a Renaissance moment for education or kind of a new normal that we're heading towards. Well, you know, when we came to Cheg, our CEO came 13, 14 years ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,57,2022-11-03 17:47:44
4767," or kind of a new normal that we're heading towards. Well, you know, when we came to Cheg, you know, our CEO came 13, 14 years ago, I'm now in my 13th year here, we were a textbook renter, but our vision was always that we would offer many types of services online, and we used to use the term and continue to use the term that you bet on the inevitable. And the inevitable is that more and more things are going to be done online. And so we embarked upon offering subscription services, homework help services that were exactly how students wanted, and that is they're relatively inexpensive, they're online, they're available 24 by seven, and those are the types of services that students expect, and we continue to deliver, whereas, you know, the traditional college experience was all of the help was, you know, on campus, but that's not the modern student today. Well, I mean, I think a lot of people don't realize is that, you know, you may think of a traditional four-year residential school, but many of the students in today's environment are actually part-time students, they're commuting into community colleges. They don't have the ability to get help, you know, at the institution, and so we provide that opportunity to learn anywhere, anytime, any place. And Andy, you guys are also expanding more into things that have nothing to do with traditional students, that is college students, right? You're looking more to the corporate world as well. I know you have a partnership that allows companies to give their employees language learning. How big a part of your business is that, and how much are you looking to that business for growth? Yeah, so you've talked about our skills platform, and we've believed for a long period of time that, you know, while most of what we do today or have historically has been academic learning, we believe skills-based learning will play a much larger role, is playing a much larger role, and will continue to play at a larger role in the future. So to your point, we have several skills products. One is what we call our thinkful line of services, and then more recently language learning with BUSU. And we do work with a company called Guild, that then delivers those services to large corporations like Chipotle and a Wal-Mart and so forth. And more recently, what we announced on our earnings call is that we were going to be including our language skills services through Guild starting in 2023. So we do believe, you know, when you imagine, check, I'll call it two to three years or now, skills will be a much bigger part of our revenue and contribution. And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts, and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw an adjusted EBITDA in the positive. Where is that coming from? How are you guys achieving that? And what are some of your targets on that front? Yeah, so we've always focused on profitable growth. And that's always something that we've talked about at our company, and as you can see, we continue to do that. We had a nice beat in Q4. But inherently in our model, because we've got a fairly fixed content cost, and much of our users come through unpaid sources, it's just natural that as we scale, our margins will scale. And I'll just remind everybody, we're profitable across every line. It's not just EBITDA, it's not just non-GAP. We're GAP profitable. So we do believe that will continue. We're not going to put a cap on where that would be. We're not at a steady state profitability yet. We do believe that as we scale, we will continue to increase our margins. Andy, while we have you, this has been a significant year, perhaps the most significant that I can remember in terms of student loan debt relief. And kind of the conversation to advance the cost of college and reforming the high expenses that families and individuals incur. Perhaps from the Cheg Lens, you can give us your read through moving forward from here, where some of these costs can start coming down, given that Cheg was one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,58,2022-11-03 17:51:55
4768," families and individuals in Kerr. Perhaps from the Cheg Lens, you can give us your read through moving forward from here, where some of these costs can start coming down, given that Cheg was one of those platforms that ultimately can reduce the costs on the book front that were so extensive for a lot of college goers and education seekers. Yeah, so it is painful. And I think this is more of a, it pains me to see college students going to college taking on large debt. But then are unavailable to actually pay it off. And that's what you're seeing. So does that disconnect on the ROI? In many cases, not all cases, but in many cases the ROI. And I think that is a big part of what, as a society, we need to fix. What is the ROI of going to college? So we don't get into these situations where students, fundamentally can't pay that debt off, which is real simple. There isn't an ROI. On that particular student's education. So I think that's the fix that we need to do. And that still hasn't been accomplished. Andy Brown, thanks so much for being here. Cheg's Chief Financial Officer. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, retail round, I will break down some more earnings from Under Armour, Etsy and Crocs. All of them in the green. Look at that. That's on the other side of the break. I think it'll help you with the mealничant time. Don't worry. You know, certainly raise above and down, or I can't afford.

I've got some retail movers for you now starting with crocs. Those shares are up 7% after third quarter results top estimates. The footwear company reported adjusted earnings of $2.97 share versus estimates of $261. The company also raised its guide for 2022. The enduring appeal of crocs never phrase I thought I would ever say. But that is what we've been saying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,59,2022-11-03 17:56:24
4769," It's gotten for 2022. The enduring appeal of Crocs never phrase, I thought I would ever say. But that is what we've been seeing. You're even as the company has been raising its prices, right? Definitely Crocs have gotten priceier. If you buy the gibbits, those little doohickeys that are on there from the company itself, super expensive, you can buy the knockoff ones wherever. But if you want the authentic ones from the company, that's also adding to their sales. I think you have to get past this notion that Crocs is a fad. They put, really, this is not a new quarter from Crocs under CEO Andrew Reese. This has been going on. I would argue for over two years, good quarter and the Crocs brand, good quarter and the Haydude brand. Maybe it didn't like that inventory bulged a lot, but that is, I think, keeping in line with what we've seen across retail. You can go to the Crocs website. I mean, they have these new crush boots out. They look pretty cool to me in my humble view. What I don't like is those, Brad, the Crocs with the furry lining. They have like stinky all over them. Ah, Andrew's going to like ding us, but I mean, I don't know. They just don't like the cross with the lining. It's not like you could remove the movie better if you could remove it to watch it. Right, yes, that's what those need. That's the new Adidas slide as well. I don't think that you can. You can remove that lining in the new Adidas slide, but in this Crocs one, yes. If you could remove that fire instantly. But I think the boot, actually, you don't like the boot. I do like the boot. I do like the boot. OK, I'm into the boot. I like it. I'm into the boot. There's a lot of things to like about this quarter as my computer goes flat. But the direct consumer front, I think, continued to just showcase how much people want to engage directly with the brand of Crocs. And particularly as you look through the entire kind of comfy, cozy landscape, Crocs has continued to run away not just during the pandemic, but among sentiment, even post-pandemic, as people are getting back into even some of the more kind of social constructs that they had pre-pandemic. Crocs has been, it's had some staying power quite frankly. And the specific partnerships that they've been able to drum up, whether that be with different brands, I think they had one with peeps, they had one with Justin Bieber as well. And so all of that considered, that's continued to pay dividends for them over time. And I'm getting the boots. You heard it here first. I'm going to get the boots. I think they just might be for women. I'm on the side. I can't tell. But they don't think any of their stuff is those gender specific. Yeah, OK. Most of it is unispecial. I mean, that look good on me. I am. I have been seeing some sale stuff on the site. I have to say. So that's something important to note because I didn't have a chance to look at their inventory numbers full disclosure. But they've definitely have been some sales stuff on there. So that's something to note. Yeah. And just to put a number on that direct consumer comparable sales, that was up 18.2% as I was able to log back into my computer. Let's also take a look at underarmour shares here on the day. Are they protecting this house? Yes, they are. All right. The only way is through. It's up by about 15%, 16%. Right now, the athletic wear company posted it slightly better than expected second quarter results. But cut back its guidance, citing the stronger dollar, and a, quote, more challenging retail environment. It's challenging indeed. You're taking a look at the actuals versus the estimates on your screen and turn around had to start sometime. But it's not a full turn around. I didn't see really any signs of a turn around. This is maybe this was the peloton turn around with the green shoots. Maybe Barry McCarthy should write this company's letter too as well. But look, they came out lower their guidance and one of the biggest concerns that's holiday season and retail is all the inventory sitting at various stores. And one of the most promotional brands in the store right now remains underarmour. And it's just not what this brand was founded on. I remember saving up a lot of money to buy my first moisture wicking underarmour. Sure, I had to pay full price. It was six or seven years ago. Maybe even longer than that. But still, you go now to TJ Maxx. You go to Marshall. This stuff is on sale, $10, $20 a pop. Well, and their inventory was up by 29%. So that, you know, but that's in line with what we've seen from others. They did cut the forecars, as you mentioned, but that forecast cut was largely expected. Analyst were saying they got to cut the forecast. So I guess their acknowledgement of reality was a good thing. Also, really surprising here, Asia Pacific sales up to 7%. Like who else had Asia Pacific sales up to that? Big and basketball. Yeah, they've been sending Steph Curry there every single summer to do a grassroots just boots on the ground. But still, given how shut down things have been there and given what we've been hearing from other companies, that's not been surprising. Remember, they still don't have a permanent CEO, by the way. Well, I remember Patrick Friskel-F. This has always been Kevin Planck's house. You covered on Armour too, as well.

4770, scholarships to Orange and Brown students of South Florida Stealing School successful to improve equity skills and their important community members are We're continuing to watch shares of the Qualcomm this morning after the company slashed its forecast for smartphone shipments and gave a glumir sales outlook for more let's bring in technologists research president chief analyst Bob O'Donnell Bob great to speak with you as always here all right we come out of this quarter and really kind of back out what they had to say and and really look through the core fundamentals of the business but also the trends in the market are persisting for them what really sticks out to you. Look Qualcomm has been on a journey of changing into a much broader company for several years now really but we're really starting to see it come into play but the fact of the matter is 56% of the revenue this last quarter was for smartphones right that's still a huge chunk and that's why there's been so much focus on you know their numbers and their expectations but as with the PC market we're seeing that the smartphone market is is taking this post pandemic dip and it's going to be difficult there's a bunch of inventory out there just as again we've seen with the PC guys there's a lot of similarities in terms of what's been happening out there on that front but you know they did have that automotive analyst day a couple weeks ago in New York talking about all the automotive business they have of course they're providing the chipset for the new vr headsets they're doing a number of areas because what they're able to do is leverage the technology they have particularly around things like modems and RF stuff that's really really hard to do as Apple is learning and apply that in a number of places they've had this in automotive for a long time you what are what's called the telematic systems and they've been driving that for a long time now as they have more advanced sensors that originally started in the smartphone market they're bringing that into into the automobile market and you know as we move to software defined cars and much more capabilities clock on and saying hey look you've been working with us for a long time anyway we're a natural entree for you to bring some of these advanced capabilities to digital cockpit to the Snapdragon ride that format that they have or excuse me that they have so you know it's this typical thing with semiconductors right now short term is pretty tough for just about all of them longer term those companies that have really diversified themselves I think have a really strong growth story qualcomm is one among them AMD of course similar type of situation they just reported earlier this week as well. What is this correction in the level of inventory when does that ease and start to improve. You know Brian I mean they said you know in the in the call they said it's going to be several quarters to get through that inventory again we're hearing relatively similar types of things from some of the other big semi folks so I think that's just a reflection of the fact that again a lot of people are slowing down the pace at which they with which they upgrade their their smartphones I mean let's think about it we're not seeing a whole lot of innovative smartphone designs you know everything is much more incremental we've had a few big jumps with foldables but so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,61,2022-11-03 18:08:39
4771," designs, you know, everything incremental. We've had a few foldables, but there's still a small piece of the market. You know, iPhones are evolving but again modest pace. So there isn't that overwhelming sense I have to have the latest new great smartphone. Now, there's still plenty of upside for 5G smartphones. You know, that's of course, we're call com, call com strength is typically been. So I think you're going to develop that market, but it's just going to be at a slower pace and keep we're going to have to get used to that in the short term remembering that there's still those long-term opportunities. Bob, hey, it's Julie here. I have to wonder about the implications for Apple, right? Because we keep getting these signs that smartphones sales are going to weekend. We got this is call com is just the latest. Apple shares today are down more than 3%. And I'm curious why is it going to be a good thing to have the market in the last for the smartphone market? You know, hey, Julie, I think it could be a while. I mean, I think, you know, we could be again, drawing analogies to the PC market, maybe not declining quite as rapidly, because PCs grew even more during the pandemic and therefore, unfortunately, are falling even more. But smartphones did reasonably well during the pandemic. But again, people are like, OK, I'm good for a while and I'm not going to be able to get it right now. That's really kind of hitting and when people have to make a decision, you know, if things get tough from a macro economic perspective, they're like, look, my phone is good. And you know, it's getting easier to get them repaired if you just want to replace the glass. Of course, because people do that all the time. So I just don't feel like there's this compelling desire until we start to see something really dramatically fall. Eventually, I think Apple may do something like that. That will add some pizzazz to the market. But I still think work a few years off. But to Apple's challenges that you mentioned, you know, they bought Intel's modem IP. That's the chip that allows you to do the communications with the cellular network. And it's hard stuff. I mean, RF is the radio frequency stuff is very difficult. There's really only two companies in the world that do well. It's Paul Common Media Tech. And Apple, you know, had plans to do their own modem, and they still will. It's just not they've already delayed it a year. And who knows if it goes even longer. So that's upside for Qualcomm that nobody expected to happen. So good for them. But offset, of course, by the fact that the overall market is still declining. If the metaverse takes office Qualcomm Net Beneficiary. Yes, it is. It is. I mean, because there are, you know, when we think about at least the standard metaverse, I mean, longer term we'll see. But near term, you know, they've got the chip that's powering the headsets. Again, there are a couple other competitors that Qualcomm by far is more advanced in that regard. But, you know, I mean, look at it now even, right? I mean, they put that in their IoT revenue. And it's still a small fraction of Qualcomm's revenue. So even if it explodes, it becomes a reasonable percentage of Qualcomm's revenue. That's a big, big amount of effort that we're going to have to happen. And I am going to have to have a third phone, which to me is just another example and reason why I think the metaverse as some people have touted it is a long way off. Bobo Donald, President Chief Annals. Now let's ask research. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks. Appreciate you having me.

4772,"école the Checking in on the king, the burger king that is. Parent company restaurant brands saw global same-source sales climb 9% led by 10% rise at burger king and strong international growth restaurant brand CEO. Jose Sil is fresh with us off his earnings call. Jose happy national sandwich day to you my friend. You know we were talking earlier on in the show. Why a lot of companies like yours the burger players are doing better than the pizza guys. Why do you think that's the case? Well Brian thanks for having me great to be here on especially on national sandwich day also on our earnings day. By the way we have a Popeyes by one get one free sandwich chicken sandwich during this important national holiday. Look I we're excited obviously with the momentum in our brands in our business and we saw some really strong performance in the quarter that we we shared earlier in earnings. I think the I think our brands are well positioned in all moments in time right. We have great food great beverages at Burger King. Thames Popeyes and firehouse and we have we provide great experiences digital become a bigger part of our business. We have various service modes delivery drive through a dinin curb side and some restaurants. And we do so with our digital capabilities at a great value. So it's a compelling offer. It's why we grow on on frequency and it's the kind of the core element of our business model that's so exciting and we do so in good times and especially and certainly during challenging times. So I think we're well positioned to kind of benefit from tailwinds in difficult moments because of the business model the great franchisees that we have and the amazing food and beverages that we serve in our brands. Even as your customer base might be looking for value within this kind of error this environment right now where do you still need to or have you had to pass through price increases to customers that are looking for not just a good meal but also a good price steel if you will. Like I think you have to start with the acknowledgement that consumers are generally value driven value for money has always been a key driver of decision making in our category in the quick service or limited service restaurant space. That doesn't mean discounting necessarily but they're always looking for good value which means they're looking for for taste quality sometimes quantity and overall experience for what they pay and I.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,63,2022-11-03 18:17:17
4773," But they're always looking for good value, which means they're looking for taste, quality, sometimes quantity, and overall experience for what they pay. And I think we're very well positioned, as I mentioned earlier, to deliver consistently on those expectations from consumers. Today, consumers, and it's slightly different in the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. But broadly speaking, there's a ton of concern around the macro, right? Inflation, food at home, grocery prices are kind of outpacing inflation away from home. On the food category, gas prices are up, energy prices, especially in Europe, are quite steeply increasing. We haven't seen any trade down or trade out of our category. But we know that there is pressure in the consumer, and our business does well. Our brands do well when we serve great tasting products, great beverages at a good price. Even if we're having to raise prices to address some inflation, and what we do on that is that we make sure we understand CPI, and we know for the U.S., it's been around 8% for Canada, it's just under 7%, and slowing down a bit. We look at food away from home, and at home inflation, we look at a number of different data points. We talk to consumers, and then we take price to address input cost, but we do so in a way that's measured to ensure that we don't chase away our very important customers that are the key to our success alongside our franchisees. Jose, just given those pressures on consumers, do you need a six-item dollar menu? Well, look, I think having value and having a balanced menu is always important, Brian, we have a core offering, which is fundamental to success, is why people come to Burger King Popeyes, Tins, and Firehouse. They know those core items, and they're there consistently for those core items. We have premium offerings, which allow for indulgence and for those treats from time to time. Then we have value as an everyday proposition in each of our brands. We've had dollar menus or kind of entry-level ala-cart menus. I don't know if dollar is any longer the relevant price point, but having an everyday entry-level price point product that consumers can go to ala-cart and or to bundle, I think, is an important aspect of being a broad-based and very thoughtful restaurant business. That's something that we continue to explore and look at. Our teams are working on quality and product offerings at the right price that allow for customers to come in more frequently and enjoy our brands day in and day out. There's two and a half percent net restaurant growth when you think about the franchisees. What are you hearing from franchisees right now and even potential franchisees in different markets and how they're potentially looking to get into business with restaurant brands? We have a lot of excitement around growth in our business and fundamentally restaurant brands and our four amazing iconic brands are growth brands and growth businesses. We've got a lot of room for growth internationally for all four of our brands, even Burger King that has north of 12,000 restaurants in international markets. We've got a lot of room for growth. We think domestically with firehouse, with Popeyes, Tim's in the US is beginning to rev up their engines from a growth standpoint and obviously firehouse has a huge runway domestically as well. Franchisees are excited. They're obviously concerned in a near term with the impacts that we're seeing in inflation, commodity costs. That translates not only to food costs but also to construction costs. There's always a challenge around getting permitting and the process of getting approvals to move forward with new restaurant sites. We have a healthy pipeline. We have a lot of interest from existing franchisees as well as new franchisees to develop our brands domestically and internationally. We continue to work with our partners to move those pipelines along and continue to grow our businesses. We think we're on our way to our 40,000 restaurant goal with restaurant brands over the next several years.

Jose, I have 10 seconds left, and this is National Sandwich Day. Somebody's been out there touting their sales gains and any smack talk form. Look, our brands are awesome. We have Firehouse, Burger King, Tim's and Popeyes. I think they're the best in each of their categories in Burger Chicken, Coffee and Sandwich. And I'll let the customers decide who the best brands are. My focus is building a great team, working with the franchisees and delivering profitable opportunities for growth across the across our four brands. You're too nice Jose. You're too nice. Just too nice. Jose is a customer of Popeyes. I can say on this sandwich today that chicken sandwich is family. Thank you so much for joining us here on the show, Restaurant Brands International. Yeah, I was just gonna say, make sure you try the black and chicken sandwich, which is coming out on National TV and on the 7th of November. Awesome sandwich, really cool experience. It's a flavor of New Orleans all around the country. All right, so as you put it in his notes, so we're gonna have to do it. We're gonna do it. Restaurant Brands International CEO, Jose Sil, Jose, thanks so much as always. Thanks a lot. Have a great day. You too. Coming up everyone, Walmart is fighting back against Bryce Hikes this holiday season. We're gonna share the details on the rollback next. Here's to kind of call development and repair also. Also. Mhm. Mhm. Here at the Song, you know what time it is. Welcome back everyone. Time for a cup of time. For the stories one minute each. We start with this on the day, Marriott is joining its rival, Hyatt and Raising its annual profit forecast. Thanks to higher pricing and strong rebound in leisure and business travel despite recession risks pulling on consumer spending. It is remarkable how much we've seen the travel demand cited even outside of travel industry earnings reports. We were talking about Papa Johns earlier in today's show and them citing the return, the strong return of travel and how that impacted their business. And here we're also hearing from Marriott and Hyatt, similarly the same in that return of not just the leisure traveler but some corporate travel trickling back into. Yeah, I think we, this holiday season is going to be expensive to travel. We've heard it now from the airlines as you know we've now heard it from the hotels. Prices are going up and they were already hard to begin with. One of the reasons that Marriott might be down today, one analyst are Bernstein flagging the T-P.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,65,2022-11-03 18:26:08
4775," From the airlines, as you know, we've now heard it from the hotels. Prices are going up and they were already hard to begin with. One of the reasons that Maryott might be down today, one analyst of Bernstein flagging that the pipeline under construction is falling and falling again. So maybe that's part of the reason that the stock is down a little bit that there's some concern about the recovery of that going into next year of the net unit growth. All right, and Wayfair reported Q3 results. It's results. It beats slightly on revenue, but missed on earnings. It saw a dip in its active customer base and orders per customer. It's now looking for a break even EBDA in 2023. But we're seeing the shares up 9% nonetheless here. Pretty good market response here for Wayfair and Etsy. I think it was a market was expecting worse things from both companies and didn't get it. And I think also we're seeing this theme emerge that when companies are talking about cost cutting, when they're talking about a focus on profitability that the market likes that, even if the top line numbers or even if last quarter's numbers are looking pretty lousy. I mean, when you got a revenue drop of 9% and the stock is up 9%, I don't know. Yeah, and international was dismal. It was down 24% year over year. And now, of course, the business would be more challenged internationally within some of the areas that Wayfair does operate. But again, they said that they're continuing the work that they set out and really focusing on some of the controllables within Wayfair around driving cost of infancy, nailing basics, and earning customer and supplier loyalty. And finally, this morning, I think I took a few seconds ago, a little bit of maybe silver lining going into Thanksgiving Walmart is promising to sell a basket of Thanksgiving dinner ingredients. At last year's prices, that's a move to attract customers by easing the sting of soaring US inflation. That lower pricing will extend through December 26. It's going to apply to traditional holiday fare like whole turkeys, ham, stuffing, mixed cream, and some great stuff. Remember, our BriKtopoma recently told us what is it a 15% increase I believe overall in the Thanksgiving basket? So this is good news for people shopping Walmart. Is it good news for Walmart margins? Well, I already decided. I'm getting one of those black and chicken sandwich from Burger King for my Thanksgiving. Thanks, David. I'm ready to go. I'm going to actually buy ten of them and freeze them. You know, that will be our friends giving here on the set. We'll just do the chicken sandwich reviews, perhaps. Yeah. Let's do it. Welcome. Look, man. for Walmart here. You're not gonna come to Eburger King. I know you're not. How about you? I was thinking about you. I wasn't gonna invite you. I'm bringing the Popeye street sandwich. Family and Thanksgiving sauce. I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry. We can do a separate friend's giving. We can do a separate friend's giving. Oh, I just basically called me a loser on life TV. It's great. Thanks, Julie. Have a great rest of the day. You'll be with your family too. Stop lying. Come on. Come on. All right. We gotta leave it there. I keep up with you. It's gonna come to your car.

And of course we are watching yields very closely given the back of that Fed decision that came down yesterday. 10 year yield there. Take a look at that at 415. Let's bring in Jared Blyckery for a deeper dive on the market today. Jared, how are things looking? Things are looking a little odd. I'm not going to say dismal but a little bit red on the U.S. Frontier. You can see the NASDAQ leading the way down about half a percent so not a disaster here. But let me take you inside some of the moves that we've seen in the currency markets. Now first I want to start with the British pound because we had a bank of England decision overnight where they raised interest rates there on the short end of the spectrum by 75 basis points. Sound familiar? That's what the Fed did yesterday but what's different is that the bank of England signalling that they're pretty much done and that markets had anticipated them continuing to raise rates. However, that was a mistake on part of market participants. And so their currency is actually losing value with respect to the U.S. dollar is down 1.5 percent. It might be a little bit hard to see this chart here. This is a three month chart of the British pound versus U.S. dollar and we can draw this trend line here. It has broken down so it is racing back down towards parity with the U.S. dollar. Now this gives a little bit of breathing room perhaps to the UK people however you got to imagine that inflation going to rear its ugly head once again they are in a worse situation by the U.S. with recession they're considered pretty much imminent if they're not in it already. I want to show you the 10 year Tino yield now. It's up to 4.14 percent the five year even higher 4.36 percent and then on the very short end of the spectrum the 13 week T bill yield a bit less than those two so we have the yield curve expanding on the very short end. Now what I want to show you is also the U.S. dollars is going to be inverse to what we're looking at in the pound so it is stronger by 1 percent and by the way these are 20 plus your highs so the U.S. dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,67,2022-11-03 18:34:38
4777," I show you is also the US dollars is going to be in verse to what we're looking at in the pound. So it is stronger by 1% and by the way these are 20 plus your highs. So the US dollar has been giving stocks and other risk markets quite a bit of trouble lately and that is a case today as well. You can see tech communication services really taking on the chin here down about 1.3% energy in the green today but look at over the last two days. We can see the mega cap sectors. These three down here down three four almost five percent and that's really reflected in the Nasdaq 100. This is again over two days. Apple down six and a half percent Amazon a little bit less meta down 5% so is alphabet. Just show you what's happening today. A little bit better picture but looking at some losses here guys. So we'll have to see what comes of this into the close. Okay still early on in the session here. Thanks so much for that Jared. Well let's take a deeper dive here now on the Fed after the decision to raise rates again by another 75 basis points. Fed share power warning levels of US interest rates will go higher than previously projected. Take a listen. At some point as I've said in the last two press conferences it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% goal. There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates. Even so we still have some ways to go and incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected. With more on the road ahead for the Fed look at the Yahoo finances Jennifer Schomburger and Jen we saw the reaction of the markets yesterday but certainly the Fed share making pretty clear that there the data is just not where they want it to be. Good morning Kiko that's right Fed share pal setting the table to begin slowing down the pace of rate hikes but says the question of when to moderate the size of rate increases isn't as important as ultimately how high the central bank will ultimately raise the Fed funds rate to team inflation. Pal says interest rates will now rise higher than forecast until the Fed gets to a level that's quote sufficiently restrictive. All this means the interest rate projections for ending rate hikes around the level of 4.6% forecast back in September are now too low. So the question is how much higher do they go from here? Well Roberto Parley who was a long time Fed watcher over at Piper Sandler says he thinks the peak rate could rise to 4.8% at minimum that we says the Fed can't continue hiking at 75 basis points every meeting which is why they're looking to slow down if they did they would reach 10.6% by the end of next year. Now the market is pricing in a peak Fed funds rate of 5.15% in June of next year. That's about 20 basis points higher than before the Fed meeting will steth a bond portfolio manager over at Wilmington Trust says he thinks the terminal rate might not also be higher but also stay higher for longer than what the market is expecting given that the Fed hasn't seen progress on inflation like they would. Now pal says he doesn't think the central bank is over tightened but perhaps the risk of continuing to raise rates aggressively risks cratering the economy which is why the Fed is looking to slow the pace of rate hikes so the economy can better digest those. Indeed Alice over at Bank of America say that policy lags complicate the ability of the Fed to judge their prior actions on the economy and that now that they're moving into more restrictive territory the risk reward trade off favors smaller rate hikes going forward. I can go. Okay certainly a lot to look ahead to thanks so much for that Jen. Well let's keep the conversation going on the Fed and what this means for investors we've got Priya Mestra, TD Securities Managing Director and Global Head of Rate Strategy. It's interesting here Priya when you look at the market reactions yesterday it felt like there was a bit of a resetting of expectations after there was so much hope on a potential head fed pivot or a pause. Now that we heard from Jay Powell where do you put the terminal rate and when does it all end? Sure thanks for having me so it was a nuanced message that the Fed was trying to convey yesterday. Slow a pace but potentially higher end point and the focus remains.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,68,2022-11-03 18:38:41
4778," Thanks for having me. So it was a nuanced message that the Fed was trying to convey yesterday, slow a pace, but potentially higher end point. And the focus remains squarely on inflation. And how quickly does it decline? You know, does it decline? How sticky is it on the way down? And so we actually revised up our terminal rate focus. We were in the 5% cam before yesterday. Now we're thinking 5 and a half by May of next year. And then the Fed keeps it there because, you know, inflation is extremely broad based. It has been sticky on the upside. We think it's going to take a while for it to come back down. And I'm we're taking the Fed at their word. They're committed to getting inflation down. And so we think they're going to struggle to ease or even stop hiking until their clear signs that inflation has downshifted. And so, you know, we think they're going to continue to raise rates. I do think that the risk of recession has become even greater because, you know, there are the, there are lags that the Fed cannot see that data right now. They the impact of policy tightening. They're going to continue to tighten. And I think, you know, as the economy starts to slow down, their task becomes a lot harder because if inflation is high, even if the unemployment rate is rising, I think we can't get a preemptive Fed that can start to ease. So it makes the risk of a downturn by in the second half of next year. Very high. We're actually looking for a recession in the second half of next year. And then that the Fed starts the easing process really in 2024. So it's going to be a tough couple of years as the two conflicts of the Fed, I think the two goals of the Fed are in conflict. When you say the risk of a recession is higher, I mean, how much more significant? If you're already looking at a recession in the second half of the year, how is that different from where you were going into the meeting yesterday? Sure. So I think we would anyway know this about a recession because it's not just the Fed funds rate. You look at the tightening and financial conditions or you look at the tenure. Most of us borrow at the 5 to 10 year part of the curve and those rates have risen significantly and it's been a real rate driven increase. So we were anyway concerned that things are slowing. I think which I pal, I think reinforcing the inflation commitment, not giving any room to letting lags play out or being willing to tolerate a slightly high inflation for a longer period of time. I think these were all things that the market that's been waiting for a pivot was hoping for. And that's why we saw that big reaction the statement because it looked like the Fed was at least nodding to lags. But then it turns out no, there might be nodding to the lags too for the pace of hikes, but not for the end point. And that makes the chance that the Fed takes rates higher. That's why we revised our terminal rate. 5 and 1,500, QT is also continuing so that can keep pressure on that belly of the curve or the tenure, and that makes the chance of hard landing higher. And I would say the market is under the impression it's a short, shallow recession, well, if you don't get any monetary help and I don't think we're going to get any fiscal easing, this idea of a short, shallow recession I am pushing back against that I think it could need not be a wait but a recession that can last for a while because you just don't get that policy support that I think we've been used to the other month. The market's been used to getting some help and I think that help is going to be much harder in a high inflation environment. Yeah, so the warning certainly elevated for investors who are out there. Priya, you pointed to the fact that there's always a lag factor with Fed policy and we certainly heard from the Fed Jerry Estarday acknowledging that we're now into what four-stray jumbo size hike. We, to what extent have we already seen that we've been able to get the vaccine that take hold and how much of a lag factor are you looking at? Sure, so I think there's a shorter lag between Fed policy and financial conditions. I think transparency, the fact, the dot plot, the communication from the Fed makes the, I think, market price in Fed policy in a better way. Of course, Fed policy itself has been extremely hard to call. I mean, they've changed their dot plot significantly every dot plot this year. So, I think that's a good thing. I think the financial conditions are pricing it in somewhat appropriately. I think what is unknown is how quickly does inflation come down. And if it is sticky, I do think there's going to be more financial conditions tightening because that means that the Fed is going to keep going potentially even higher than our forecast of five and a half on the terminal rate. But then there's the big question on when does the economy respond to it? And we've had the question on when does the economy respond to it? And we've had",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,69,2022-11-03 18:43:26
4779," means that the Fed is going to keep going potentially even higher than our forecast of five and a half on the terminal rate. But then there's the big question on when does the economy respond to it? And we've had this big white savings buffer that the consumer has had, that is buffer is dwindling, that that buffer is dwindling. So over the course of next year, we think more in the second third quarter that the consumer starts to pull back. And that's what we will start to result in a recession. The labor market will start to cool down. So, you know, I think the lags might be there's a lot of talk that the lags might be shorter. I think for financial markets, I get that. But I think for the economy, the lags actually might be longer because the consumer has a savings buffer. So the labor market's going to look tight until that savings buffer is gone and service demand starts to slow down. And we think that's the second quarter, third quarter time frame next year. So, which is why the Fed has free rein to keep raising rates really into the face of recession. So either way you look at it, all signs pointing to more pain ahead. Priya, it's good to get your insights today. Priya, Miserade, TD Securities Managing Director and Global Head of Rate Strategy. What is time now for our trending ticker. And today we're taking a look at shares of Roku, getting a 52 week low today, down about 8%, despite beating estimate in its latest quarter. The streaming firm warning it expects the macro environment, the pressure consumer discretionary spend further and a great advertising budget. The company expects these conditions to be temporary, although it says it's difficult to predict when they will stabilize or rebound. Roku's now forecasting fourth quarter total in that revenue of roughly $800 million and lower year on year player and platform revenue. So, Mia, deep decline in broke who shares today. Well, coming up, it is another rough day in what has been a brutal year for palatine investors after the company issued disappointing guidance. We're going to take a closer look at the numbers on the other side of the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,70,2022-11-03 18:47:37
4780," Shares of Peloton coming off of the lows of the session, but still down more than 3% after the company issued weak guidance for the holiday quarter. The company CEO says, quote, the ship is burning. Joining me now to break down the results. We've got City, senior analyst and managing director Ron Josie. Okay, so we can focus on the negative. We know this has been a turnaround story for some time, but I want to flip the question and start with what I think could be a positive. You say this is sort of the turnaround story is starting to take hold. And we did hear from CEO Barry McCarthy today saying that we're done now in terms of flashing headcount. I mean, what's the silver lining out of this report if there is any? Yeah, no, OK, go. It's a good question. I mean, because we can talk about the negatives for a while here. And there's some things that we definitely need to be aware of, but the bottom line is churn improved in the quarter. We have newer distribution models with third parties like Amazon and Dix on top of Amazon's top of pelton's first party that that should help drive continued growth. You have a cost base that is significantly reduced. I think employees are down over 50% really since February. So really what you have here is a streamlined business that has a tremendously engaged member base where churn is coming more in line with historicals after the pricing increase. And you have visibility, at least we think there's visibility in the greater overall or positive free cash flow towards the end of this fiscal year. So in the back half of this year. So the silver lining here is look, turn around your heart. We know that churn is improving. That suggests engagement remains strong. And frankly, these newer things that the business has been doing in terms of third party partnerships, their rental program with fast things along those lines. They should improve overall results over the next couple quarters going forward. Sure, the earnings results specifically asking about free cash flow guidance. And what made the leadership team feel confident about beating the one year timeline? I mean, how confident are you in their strategy? Did you feel like you got to satisfy your answer? Yeah, no, it's a really good question. I think the answer is yes, right? I think when you think about the changes that have happened in this business, and really just the last six to nine months between the multiple rifts between basically going from insourcing or being a verticalized strategy from creating your own bikes or manufacturing your own bikes, delivering them yourself to outsourcing all of that, this business has gone through a tremendous amount of change. And so as we take this step back and we think about where we are today, the cost base is much lower. So in other words, the variable cost structure is certainly better. The member base is seems to be stabilized, which is strong. And that gets to engagement at the end of our day. Then the day our core thesis here is that engagement drives everything in this business. And our view here is that those members that are on the bike stay on the bike for a while here. And it's something that we haven't really seen in other type of consumer subscription models. So that's positive. And then you add to that, you know, we're going into the holidays with newer distribution partners. And so all this combined should help drive better free cash flow in the years. We just talked about, but does it give us more confidence? I think the answer is yes. Now, to be clear, there's changes in this business, right? So the fast business or the rental bike business, it will change the structure of when Peloton generates the revenue. Their distribution partners, third part of distribution partners with Amazon and Dix will have a lower overall selling price because it's more of a wholesale partnership for the most part. That'll impact revenues. But I think the profitability should start showing up here over the next couple quarters. And naturally, the key thing of proving out the viability in the business here. So the top line seems to be stable, at least in subscribers. That's a good, that's good. And overall costs are pretty much taken out. So we're leaner, more streamlined organization that should drive a greater overall profitability and sustainability in the business. Finally, really quickly, this doesn't change the fact that this is a stock that has seen it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,71,2022-11-03 18:51:43
4781," for all costs are pretty much taken out. So we're leaner, more streamlined organization that should drive a greater overall profitability and sustainability in the business. Finally, really quickly, I mean, this doesn't change the fact that this is a stock that has seen a steep fall this year. We're now looking at $8.47 a share. If the turnaround strategy's working and you feel like things are taking hold, is this kind of where fair value should be? So, I mean, it's a good question. Our price target, you know, published is certainly higher. When if you would strip out everything and just look at the subscriber base and where churn where it is, the 1.2% X some one time things like, you know, there's a lot of value in that subscriber base. And as a result, we think there's a lot of value in this business and we think shares are not reflecting that because the turnaround's take time, especially one of this magnitude, especially one that, you know, went through the pandemic with massive demand being pulled forward and now we're when a completely different environment and macros coming up here as we just heard your prior guest talk about in terms of concern. So, you know, from a fair value perspective, we think there's room to go on shares. That said, we understand it's a turnaround strategy. There's a lot of moving pieces here. We want to see that free cash flow better. Our model suggests we could get there or we can get there. And that's really what's gonna drive shares here. The next call it 12 months or so. And that's our vision or longer term focus on the name. Ron Josie, senior analyst and managing director at that he always good to have you on a appreciate your insight today. Thanks, Akiko. Likewise. And we've got much more earnings to dive into. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexander Seminova. Alexander, you know, we've gotten so much negative news out of this. And can we sort of take away some positive here, especially when you're looking at the retailers that have reported so far? Absolutely, Akiko. It's another big morning for corporate earnings with a flurry of retailers headlining today's results. Among them is Crocs shares are up about 7%. After the footwear company reported third quarter figures that beat Wall Street estimates, quarterly sales and direct to consumer comparable sales rose sharply as well as revenue for its hey, dude, brand up 87%. During the period, the company raised its full year guidance with CEO Andrew Reese citing strong back to school performance. And 20% constant currency revenue growth in its Crocs brand. Let's turn now to under armor, also beating estimates for the quarter, but signaling a less optimistic view of what's ahead for the company. The sports brand said sales for the 2023 fiscal year are set to rise in the low single digits that's down from the 5% to 7% it projected earlier. The company attributed lower expectations to quote a more challenging retail environment and additional negative impacts from changes in foreign currency and BMO analyst Simeone Segal, who is a friend of the show telling us this morning that he believes shares are still priced too low. He reiterated his outperform rating on the stock this morning. And speaking of some positive takeaways here, we've got Etsy, that stock just on a tear today up well over 10%. What's feeling the rally there? Well, Akiko results signal today to investors that e-commerce is still holding a better than expected, especially ahead of the all important holiday shopping season at CZ Revenue came in at $594.5 million. That's up 11.7% from a year ago gross merchandise sales down slightly, but still at the higher end of the projected range, the online marketplace also said it expects continued strength in its sales into the fourth quarter. That's helping lift shares today. Analyst from Evercore ISI this morning saying the company maintained its pandemic success and is showing healthy levels of profitability as well.

4783, you Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. I'm Sean Smith. Let's get you up to speed on today's market action. It's just about an hour to go until the closing bell. Dow actually now imposit territory up just around 29 points recovering from the losses earlier in the session. Take a look at the S&P. That's still in the red. Off just about a fourth of a percent because the in the intraday chart well off the lows of the session as well. Nasdaq 100 still remains in the red. The worst performer of the three averages off just over one percent. Some of those big tech names leading today's decline. We'll take a look at that here in just a second. Let's first take a look at the bond market yield pushing higher once again the two year yield which is obviously the most rate sensitive yield. That's hitting the highest levels that we've seen since July 2017 taking over the 10 year yield. Pushing higher once again up seven basis points to 413. Taking a look at the US dollar index. That's pushing higher once again. Just below one 13. I also want to pull up the pound here as we talk about the news that we got from overseas. The bank of England raising rates by 75 basis points also the warning of a recession the stark warning there from the bank of England. That's pushing the dollar lower once again again. Again. Excuse me pushing the pound lower against the dollar. And you can see that reflected in the intraday chart. Taking a look at some of the action that we're seeing on a sector basis. Let's start with the Nasdaq 100 because again some of those larger cap tech names leading today's decline. We're looking at Apple off just over 3% as well as alphabet Google there Amazon lower for the seventh trading day in a row Microsoft off just around 1.6%. Taking a look at the Dow industrial the largest decline is there obviously the same story there with the larger cap tech names but we are seeing some of those industrial names of value stocks holding onto getting a look at Honeywell for example up just around 2.6% on an intraday basis Boeing leading the way there up just about 7% sector action. Taking a look at all 11 of the SMP sectors energy industrials leading the way technology communications lagging in today's action that's okay technology ETF off just over 2%. Despite another rate hike from the Fed mortgage rates having slipped below 7% again that's according to Freddie Mac the 30 year fixed rate mortgage average at 6.95% that's down from last week's 7.08% for context though it's still more than double from just a year ago when it average 3.09%. Freddie Mac's chief economist saying that quote unsure buyers navigating an unpredictable landscape keeps demand declining while other potential buyers remain sideline from an affordability standpoint worth noting mortgage rates attract the yield on the 10 year treasury note versus muring the Fed's interest rate hikes a 10 year ticking up since the Fed's announcements and mortgage rates may follow suit in the coming days. Again just around 57 minutes to go until the closing bell Dow back in positive territory but still looking at losses from the SMP and the Nasak we want to bring in Brad McAmillan coming wealth financial network chief investment officer Brad it's great to see you so certainly I guess a different day is we'll get the doubt up just around 13 points following yesterday losses although Nasak still clearly in the red what do you make of the trading action that we've seen over the last 24 hours. You know it's interesting Shawna because we see this movie over and over again the Fed comes out and says we're going to keep hiking rates into inflation stops and the market starts to talk to itself and says well maybe they're really going to pivot. And the Fed says no we're really going to keep hiking rates in the market goes down and then the same thing happens this is just the latest.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,74,2022-11-03 19:04:39
4784," starts to talk to itself and says, well, maybe they're really going to pivot. And then the Fed says, no, we're really going to keep hiking rates and the market goes down. And then the same thing happens. This is just the latest iteration. It's about interest rates. It's about the Fed. It's not about the economy. It's the market reacting to the Fed. And we're going to keep seeing this until inflation comes back down. We're going to keep seeing this until inflation comes back down. It seemed like the market was looking for any sort of hope here, any sort of good news from the Fed. And we certainly saw that reflected in the action after the decision was announced. And then when Fed Chair Jay Powell's a press conference got underway in terms of what the Fed has done so far, the latest rate hike and what we could see over the next month or two at the next two meetings. Do you think the Fed is potentially being too aggressive at this point? I think there's a real chance we're going to see the economy get hit very hard towards the middle of next year. There is the lag on these hikes. They've been very severe, very fast. But that's actually what the Fed is looking for. They're looking to see things come back. We are seeing some slowing growth, but we're not seeing it in the jobs market. And that's, I think, what the Fed is waiting for to declare victory to see the jobs market really soften in a material way. They want to see people being able to shop and buy, go down. So that's what I'm watching for as a signal that we are close to the end. And, Brad, certainly, even from the dead out this morning, it doesn't seem like the jobs market is losing steam at the rate clearly that what the Fed would have liked to see. What are you expecting to see in the next jobs report tomorrow? And then looking out, I guess, to what you think the Fed should do at the next meeting. What do you think should be on the table? I think they should do 50 basis points in the next meeting. And then 25 after that. In other words, keep the pressure on. But at the same time, recognize just how much damage has been done. When you look at the residential investment figures, if we do get a recession, it's very likely to be investment driven. And that's actually better for the average work, or so I'm OK with that. But right now, with all the tightening they've done, I would step back and wait. The problem is the market will love that. And that's not what the Fed wants to see either. Yeah, clearly not what the Fed wants to see. And that was all that reflected in the commentary from Fed Chair Jay Powell. A yesterday afternoon, Brad, you mentioned the risk of a recession. If we do, in fact, see a recession, I guess, how deep of a recession do you think we could potentially get? I think we probably will see a recession at this point. But I'm not taking a soft landing off of the table. And the reason I'm saying that is, as long as you have this many people working, as long as you have a job market, as strong as this one is, it's very hard to get a consumer-led recession that's anything meaningful. We are seeing investment go down. We're seeing housing go down. That could take us into technical recession. But if we do get a recession, I think it's going to be short, maybe a quarter or two, and probably no worse in the recession we had last year, two week orders, and then things will normalize. And Brad, we did hear from Fed Chair Powell that that path for a soft landing has definitely narrowed. What is the investor position here as people all racing for a potential recession? Well, I think you have to certainly have to stay defensive. You know, personally, I'm working at health care. I'm working at consumer staples. I want to be fading the consumer, because as I say, I don't think that's where the principal risk is going to be. When you look at it from an investment standpoint, if the Fed is saying we're going to keep raising rates, and if you believe them, that's going to keep the pressure on growth stocks. That's going to keep the pressure on, especially tech stocks, and we're seeing that in the market. So I think it's a time to stay defensive. I think it's a time to focus on value and dividends. I think it's a time to focus on stocks that actually benefit from the average consumer. So I think they're going to continue to do OK. What do you make of earnings using so far? I guess given tech stocks, you didn't mention that. They weren't one of your picks, at least as of right now. And I think a lot of investors would agree with that sentiment. But from the slowdown that we've seen from a lot of those tech giants and the volatility, really, that we've seen in some of those bigger names so far today, and the heels of the latest rate hike from the Fed, what do you think that signals just in terms of the volatility that we could potentially see within that sector over the coming months? Well, you've got to remember that really, there's two things going on here. There's the earnings. And obviously, there's been some material news on a number of the tech companies for earnings. But it's not really about earnings for them. It's about valuation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,75,2022-11-03 19:09:08
4785," There's two things going on here. There's the earnings. And obviously, there's been some material news on a number of the tech companies for earnings. But it's not really about earnings for them. It's about valuations. And that's very tough to call because that depends on the expectation of rates. That depends on the expectation of growth. So you get volatility when there's uncertainty. And there's two different dimensions of uncertainty around the growth stocks. Now, when you, this gets back to the value stocks, they're going to be principally about earnings and there you have a little bit more visibility. But until we have some clarity of our interest rates, I don't think the, even if the tech stocks continue to grow their earnings or do well with earnings, that still doesn't address the valuation problem. And, but obviously, we knew that that 75 basis point height was already priced in yet. Once again, we saw the markets reacting negatively. Even though obviously, FedGFL has said we're going to say the course multiple times here, what does it think you think the markets are missing when it comes to risk assessment? Well, I think it's the triumph of hope over experience. And I said this a little bit earlier, Paul has said very clearly that no, we're going to keep hiking rates until inflation is under control. And the market said, no, he really means we're going to pivot. And then he had to come out at Jackson Hole and say the same thing. And markets went down. And then the last Fed meeting, in this Fed meeting, if you look at the projections by economists, they keep saying, oh no, but rates are really going to start coming down in a couple of months. And that continues not to be the case. I think the best thing we can do as investors is to take the Fed at its word, to say that no, we're not going to see a pivot until we see inflation come down meaningfully. You know, right now they have no reason to pivot. They have no reason to stop. Job, the jobs market is still very, very healthy. Inflation is still way too high. Why on earth would they stop? And I think we just have to accept that that's not going to happen until one of those two things breaks. Hence the phrase don't fight the Fed.

4786,"itä<|ru|><|translate|> trick cannabals thirteen ale eight nine An eight g municip eight Fresh signs of weakness in the tech industry, more rounds of sweeping job cuts and hiring freezes. Amazon shares low as it pauses corporate hiring in anticipation of an economic slowdown. In the right-hailing space, also lift cutting 13% of employees, which amounts to roughly 680 workers. It's the second round of cuts this year and comes after hiring freeze was announced back in September. And payment process as Stripes says it's getting ready for quote, leaner times, causing more than 1000 jobs. It all makes for grim reading. The finance is down how it has the latest hit. So Dan, break this down for us. Yeah, it really is kind of this all around push that we're seeing in the tech industry for some kind of cost cutting measures and it seems like right now they're going for employees. So as you said, we had Stripe. They're basically announcing the CEO saying they're going to lay off 14% of their workforce. They said that they over hired for the world that they're in and it pains them to be unable to deliver the experience that they had hoped. Lift saying they're laying off those 683 employees. That's about 13% of the workforce there. We also had Amazon announcing that they're having a hiring freeze. This is new incremental hires that they're going to be freezing. They previously said that they were freezing corporate hiring for its retail business. So another kind of freeze there. And then we've had some reports that obviously Twitter is going to be doing some layoffs. This isn't necessarily related in the same way to the kind of spending cuts that other companies are doing. But in a way, it is they're looking at potentially 50% of the workforce being cut as Elon Musk assumes control of the company. So you can only imagine the other kinds of moves we're going to see from companies as far as hiring freezes or straight up layoffs. Right now, a number of them have said that they will do hiring freezes. We had intel previously saying that they were going to be cutting positions, but they haven't come out with anything concrete yet. But it seems like this is going to be something that we'll have to continue to follow as we did during the summer when the same thing was happening. Yeah, Dan, I guess compared what we're hearing now to what we did here in the summers, is there anything different just in terms of the rhetoric that's coming from some of these larger companies? And I guess the biggest headwinds facing the tech industry, we talked about the slowing advertising business. Obviously, that's having a direct impact. Also rising competition, just to name a few of the challenges out there in front of these larger companies. Yeah, I think the rhetoric is that they're trying to ensure that people recognize that it's a short term issue, not a long term issue with these companies. So Amazon saying that while they're freezing hiring for now, they're still going to be hiring in 2023. A lot of companies saying that they're going to be backfilling positions. So they're not going to just stop hiring wholesale, but they are cutting back. And I think what this really is, is their reaction to the macro environment now, recognizing that there will be improvements in the coming months or quarters. It's just not happening right the second, and they have to do something right the second. So what they're doing is they're going for these types of job cuts. And they've recognized, obviously, that they're going to have to pay for some of these, especially in the case of companies like Lyft. But as far as the freezes go, I'd rather my company be freezing hiring than laying off. Yeah, certainly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,77,2022-11-03 19:18:02
4787," especially in the case of companies like Lyft. But as far as the freezes go, I mean, look, I'd rather my company be freezing hiring than laying off. Yeah, certainly if you're a current employee, that's a much better scenario. And obviously, these tech names have been under pressure since the start of the year. And more headwinds, as if it continues to raise rates. So we will stay on that story right. Dean Halley, thanks so much. Thank you. All right, turning to crypto, fidelity opening up commission-free trading to retail investors. The platform will allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ether. And it comes after Robinhood and Binance, US offered similar services. And fidelity is also giving some customers in its 401k plans, the option to invest in crypto. Now, it's the largest 401k administrator with more than $3 trillion in assets under management. But it has not disposed details on which companies are offering crypto investments to their employees. As of now, fidelity's competitors in the space, including T-Row price and Vanguard, do not have plans to add crypto offerings, citing weak demand. Well, for Delties move coming in a tough time for the crypto industry, Bitcoin is down nearly 60% so far this year. All right, stay with us. Coming up, the current state of the housing market is giving many first time home buyers headaches. We're on the challenges they're facing next. Aha, a empresarial crisis. I'm going to put it on the top right corner of the head. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner.

I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I would say housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic. As demand increased and rates were low, we all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was. The market was prices going up, many, many bidders, no conditions, that kind of thing. So the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. That was Fedger J. Powell on the housing market. Just after he announced another 75 basis point ratehead Yahoo finances, Daniel Romero joining us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,78,2022-11-03 19:22:10
4788," And that was Fedger J. Powell on the housing market just after he announced another 75 basis point rate, I get who finances Daniel Romero joining us now and Danny. We've been hearing a lot from J. Powell just the fact that the housing market is so far out of balance. What exactly does the Fed want to see happen? Look, the Fed can't force more home builders to build more homes, right? But what the Fed can do is adjust interest rates with which tend to impact the ability and willingness for home builders to build more homes. So essentially the Fed has more power on the demand side of things than the supply side of things. If anything the supply side from what I've been hearing would need more of the administration's influence to weigh in. That's what experts have been telling me. And Danny, we know that the Fed is data dependent. So what metric is the Fed considering when then really figuring out the supply and demand balance? There's not one specific metric that the Fed is looking at especially when they're assessing the health of the labor market as well as the trends of inflation. But specifically on the housing front, you know rent data, rent prices, they want those to come down. They want mortgage applications to come down. They want the number of homes being purchased above their asking price to come down to those normal levels. And Danny, when you talk about those normal levels, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out exactly what that looks like. Can you give us an insight, I guess, into what would indicate a healthy housing market? Yeah. So home prices need to grow at the rate of inflation. So theoretically everything needs to grow to that 2% rate, you know, over the long term. So essentially, you know, the Fed doesn't want to see that 10% to 20% home price appreciation that they saw during the pandemic. I mean the Fed yesterday made it pretty clear their goal is to bring down inflation, which we're already seeing it in the housing market. Certainly. I'm seeing a lot of pain in the housing market. Sounds like there is much more to come right. Danny Romero, thanks so much. All right. Well joining us now for another perspective on the housing market is Bruce McNeilidge. Kimlock Partners, co-founder and CEO Bruce, thank you for joining us this afternoon. As we're seeing though, even though the Fed, good to have you, even though the Fed raising rates were seeing the 10-year yield ticking up mortgage rates. So for the 30-year fixed, ticking below 7%. Help us understand the correlations here. Sure. So the 10-year treasury doesn't necessarily affect the payments of commercial debt and what builders are paying, but certainly it's going to affect interest rates for the average person. And right now, actually, the rates as of yesterday were right around 7.25 and that really hurts the entry level home buyer significantly because they barely can afford a house right now with the cost of housing going up because of supply chain and materials. And as that house goes up in price, it's knocking more and more buyers out of having the ability to purchase a home and they either have to rent a home or stay in the home that they're currently in. Bruce, just what your assessment on the damage that the Fed has caused in the housing market? And I guess any concern that the Fed is doing too much with what it sounds like more rate hikes on the table? Sure. So it's really going to be a trickle-down position where people are not going to be able to buy houses. It's going to hurt mortgage brokers. It's going to hurt bankers. It's going to hurt realtors. Really hurt people. And I think what the situation was, people were not ready for this. It turned down a dime and really changed significantly more quicker than most people would have expected. So builders are still building houses but they can't sell houses. And that's really putting builders in a position where they have to discount houses. And with the Fed raising things, again, as quick as they they have done, it's hurting folks in the residential real estate business significantly. And it's going to take them many months, if not a year or two, to catch up because of what they've done at the Fed Reserve. So then Bruce, this supply and demand balance that the Fed is looking for. How far out do you see that being? So what it's going to do is it's going to not developers back because if banks aren't loaning money to developers or developers or skittish on developing land, that's going to put builders back several years because you have to develop a land before you build the houses. And so during this time, builders can't get commercial loans or interest rates are going up for the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,79,2022-11-03 19:26:24
4789," Builders back several years because you have to develop the land before you build the houses. And so during this time builders can't get commercial loans or interest rates are going up for those loans. Same thing with developers, there are having problems getting loans. And that's basically going to end up again a year, two, three years in the future. It's going to have a ripple effect because it's going to cost folks money and it's also going to cost folks a lot of time because they have to catch up because of the slowdown in the economy that the fed is creating. Bruce, we spoke to you about a month ago. You told us that traffic had been falling off just in terms of demand out there. We saw a little bit of relief, I guess, in mortgage rates this morning, although not too far below that 7% number there has demand declined even further over the last couple of weeks from your perspective. I'm actually in one of my new houses we just bought from a builder right now. And demand has not wane. The demand is still there. The entry level home buyer, the millennial they want to own a house. The problem is the houses are without a reach. They might have been saving and looking at paying a three or four percent interest rate and budgeting for that. But now that the rates are up to seven percent, it really forces those people that were working hard and saving for a house. It really knocks them out of the market and it's making tougher for all people to afford a house. And unfortunately that has a ripple effect. So then in terms of inventory, obviously people holding on to the good mortgage rates they got before the Fed started raising interest rates. What is this doing for first time home buyers? What sort of options do they actually have right now? Well, if you can qualify for a mortgage, builders are discounted houses significantly. I've seen 10%, 15%, even 20% discounts to retail pricing for the entry level home buyer to come in, take a look at houses and able to close on houses. The problem is they just can't afford houses and there are too many houses on the ground. So what builders really need right now is more buyers that can qualify for mortgages. The buyers are out there, the demand's out there, but just qualifying for mortgage and then affording that higher payment is really a hurdle for the entry level home buyer. Bruce, you mentioned 10%, 15%, 20% discounts on the table right now. Can we see larger discounts if demand if traffic doesn't pick up here? Well, I think it could be a discount in the form of number of things. They can give you different features in the house, free refrigerator, ceiling fans, credit for furniture, closing costs, credits to get a mortgage and pay the points. And so I think again, it's a supply and demand thing. We were in the deep south. We were traveling through Atlanta and one builder has 150 houses on the ground finished that they have no offers on 150 houses. And that's one builder. Imagine a dozen builders. So really the builders are going to have to keep reducing their prices until the supply and demand takes care of their inventory. And then they can certainly level off those prices, but that's going to be a big hit to the bottom line of builders. But again, something's got to give. There's too many houses built, not enough buyers right now that can qualify for mortgages. Yeah, Bruce, I know that you're focused on the southeast region right now. Is this more of a regional story or is this scenario playing out across the country? No, this is a national story. There are just not enough homes for people that want homes. The millennials are now in their 30s. They're looking to start homes and their subdivisions, they're moving out of the urban core and having children. So the demand is there. The problem is, give an example, people save in 401ks right now. 401ks have become 301ks. So people certainly don't have the money, whether it's in savings, whether it's the stock market going down and retirement plans that they can borrow from. The money's just not there. The demand is there and that's across the country. Now the southeast and southwest are certainly areas that have had much higher growth and much higher demand over the years, but it's a it's a problem nationwide. And Bruce, I want to ask you about some of the layoffs that we've seen with open door with Zillow as well. What are your expectations that we know that obviously that we're far from where we were at the peak of the pandemic, when the everyone was sort of clawing for houses right now. What are your expectations for layoffs in the retail industry here? So those I buyers will certainly be cutting back if they don't have enough houses to buy and sell that certainly is going to lead to layoff.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,80,2022-11-03 19:30:42
4790," in the retail industry here. So those I buyers will certainly be cutting back. If they don't have enough houses to buy and sell, that certainly is gonna lead to layoffs and reduced income for the I buyers. But this can be a trickle-down effect. You're talking about real estate agents, all sorts of different companies are gonna be laying off people, banks, people that do mortgages, process mortgages, sell houses, real estateors. They all are gonna be squeezed by this. And I think you're gonna see a shake out across all the different industries that make up the financial positions that have to all line up for someone to afford our banks are gonna be lending less money and there's gonna be a lot of shake out in the banking industry. That's really a challenging time, all right? Bruce McNeilidge, Kimlock Partners Co-Founder, and CEO, thanks so much for joining us again here in Yahoo Finance. Sorry, we'll come up next. Pelton, chairs, they're back in the green staging. We may come back in today's session despite few signs of progress in the company's turnaround plan. We'll break it down in our triple play next.

4791," The stock had already taken a beating year to date down more than 50 percent now, as that dividend cut was expected. Plus, in recent months, Lumen closed its two asset sales and appointed a new president and CEO, Kate Johnson, who will start in those roles on Monday. Now investors are unsure if these latest move signal a turnaround story waiting to happen or a demise, as Lumen tries to get its financial house in order. A longer term, divesting non-core business to fuel sustainable growth is a plus, but inflationary pressures and high operating costs still a concern in the shorter term. You ever saw some reaction on the street, the price target cut at UBS to $7 from $11 dollars, JP Morgan also lowering their price target as a result of the earnings and what we're just getting from this company, Cowan Out though, actually taking a more optimistic tone when it comes to these latest changes. They are saying that the dividend cut here was quote long awaited and they're also saying it can turbocharge its growth initiative. So again, the stock to eat a huge hit today, but maybe it's more of a valuation call from some of these analysts at this point. All right, my play today is Peloton shares a turning positive after dropping as much as 16 percent, falling a wider than expected loss and offering weak guidance for its holiday quarter. The company also warning that a challenging macroeconomic environment could affect its goal of achieving break-even cash flow of this fiscal year despite these challenges. Comments from CEO Barry McCarthy, I think helped maybe reassure some investors out there McCarthy saying that Peloton was making quote significant progress in its turnaround plan and he's confident in the direction of this company. I think, Ross, it's interesting to see the extent of the gains that we are right now, which is about half an hour to go in the trading day, but we know that Peloton has taken a number of steps. They've made a couple of rounds of layoffs. They've reduced the price of their bike. They've also known some other strategic changes. It hasn't yet been reflected in the results, but maybe investors are saying at nine bucks a share, they're getting a little bit more positive on the name. I don't know. I think, I mean, there's definitely some value there. It's a great product, great service. Now, I think it's something another room to attach my partner so I can put the bike in there. I can't put the bike in there, but I think it's, like I said, it's value there's IP's worth something and I think we're seeing that, and I was surprised that bounce is pretty big, pretty significant. So, I guess they liked what Barry McCaffrey at McCaffrey. McCarty, and I also think we're just close as well. It's not far. I know it's hard to keep everyone's aim straight these days, but I also think it's going to be interesting because this name has been floated as a potential takeover target by a company. There's been names floated out there. It could maybe it could be an Amazon play. Maybe someone like Samsung could come in and buy Peloton, but I don't know. I don't know how this is all going to shake out because it's slowed on that we've seen in the personal fitness product space. Certainly has not turned to corner at least as of yet. You saw Google get by fit that many years ago. I always thought that the Holy Grill would be Apple buying Peloton. That would be just amazing. Thinking of all the Apple Watch, the Apple. It would be very convenient for me as a user of both products, getting them all under one roof. I agree. I'm with you on that. Maybe Tesla might buy them. Now, right now. Well, I am watching Tesla. I'm going to share the Tesla today. The China passenger cars, the station reports that Tesla delivered nearly 72,000 China-made cars on October. Now, this figure is down 14% from its record-setting September. It comes as Tesla cut prices of the Model Y and Model 3 range across the board last month. Sealing that maybe demand is falling in its second most important market. I also want to note that Rotor-Support of the Tesla closed its flagship showroom in Shanghai and moving to smaller digs nearby, which appears to be a move to cut costs and prepare for the possibility of leaner times as 2022 comes to a close to the China. A lot of people are watching and handling here what's happening in China because it's such an important market for them. Certainly, a very, very important market for Tesla. We've heard CEO Elon Musk talk about the opportunity there time and time again. The return of COVID lockdowns, if you're there, what that could do for the economy further slow down there, which maybe, I guess, part of what we're already seeing play out in the sales numbers out of China. That would be concerning for Tesla. Also, a number of multinational companies here in the U.S. just in terms of how reliant they are on China's sale. So certainly, it could be a ripple effect outside of even the auto industry at least of right now.

4793," feet miles out there. Right now, American by having all these canceled flights is actually increasing their costs and they haven't even gotten a value out of it if they had actually invested in a pilot contract. So we're going to get this done, but it's not going to be done on the cheap. It's not going to be done with a low level investment because the revenue opportunity out there is unlike anything we've ever seen. Just listen to the quarterly calls every CO saying record revenue and passenger demand like they've never seen before, even in the so called shoulder months. So then how many of these issues were already brewing before COVID really put a lot more pressure on pilots and airline workers as well versus some of the more specific things that are now coming out. So great question. These some of these issues were Fisher cracks within the foundation of operation through management's in attention to that, but the pandemic when they did not keep pilots trained, they retired airplanes early and didn't retrain pilots for that furloughed pilots had early returbs. I think I might have mentioned that bottom line was they had this wave of pilot training that they never did, which was part of the $54 billion investment promise. That part they're still catching up from. So what they've done is they saw the revenue coming in, the demand they didn't expect that to come back to 2024. Well, they were an outlier because we saw it coming along with many analysts. So what happened is now they just dumped in ticket sales, even Delta admitted they just went for the revenue and they overplayed it. So now they have a system that is not trusted, that has been pushed to the edge and the things that they did to try and keep it rolling, they continue to try and do that. They schedule us to the maximum with very little buffer and we go illegal flight cancels, where they push us to the point of exhaustion where by FAA law, we cannot fly when we're fatigued and we have to make the right call for safety and actually fatigue off of a flight. These are all undermining the reliability and the revenue stream not to mention the brand damage and it's also pushing on a margin of safety. We're going to defend that margin of safety. So no passenger has to worry about that, but we're human and the first thing that goes when you're fatigued is your judgment. It's a vicious cycle and it's got to be stopped and some of the answers are in our contract. I can guarantee you that working with us is going to be a lot less expensive than if you work against us because there's revenue to go get out there and we want to help you harvest that. With that, as she said, it's not just about the money in the latest tentative agreement. It did call for 12% raises for pilots on the date of the contract signing plus 5% after one year, 2% after two years. Were you satisfied with that part of it or do you want a bigger pay increase? Well, that did not satisfy it at all. Number one, we got it in place. What would satisfy us is actually recognizing that the entire, the regional affiliates, the smaller airplanes, they got pay raises up into the 80% range. And that's not what we're looking for. We know they're deeply behind. You can get paid more working for a regional affiliate, the smaller airplanes and you can for main line. It's upside down. We're going to fix that. The other side of this is that every contract is up for negotiations now. Sans Alaska, who settled, you're not going to be left behind. Do your management team. You're not going to be the outlier. And I got news for you. We will have snap ups because we're all negotiating in this narrow band of time. If someone gets a little bit higher pay rate, you're not going to be an outlier by providing that because we are going to have a snap up that brings us there. It's becoming the industry standard and all this the convergence of the pandemic, the recovery and these contract negotiations make it a very safe and compelling time to negotiate modern deals with pilots. It's going to be a commoditized not only on a pay rate basis, but actual utilization rate. It's all right here and it's actually going to be good for the industry. We just have to get management to join us so that we can point all of our energy toward making a better product, put more flights out there, which will actually help ease the unit cost. The more ASMG you have out there, we get this business and we want to be a part of it in a functional way, but we will not be exploited while management tries to figure out how to modernize their operation. We'll certainly be keeping track of how talks are progressing. A big thank you. I like pilots association spokesperson Captain Dennis Tager. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. All right.

4794," I like pilot association spokesperson Captain Dennis Tager. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Shona. All right, turning to the health care industry. Pfizer by on tech have started evaluating a combination COVID flu vaccine. Yahoo, finances on Julie Kamlani joining us now with the details and on what could you tell us about this because it sounds like it would be much more convenient for you and out there who needs to get vaccinated in the future. That's right. You won't need two arms. Exactly. Yeah. So Pfizer by on time announcing that they're just starting the phase one to clinical trials of their vaccine, biotech leading this and sponsoring that clinical trial. They are a little bit behind in the game. Novavax has already announced positive results from a phase one to trial, but this is just adding to another COVID race. Basically, we do know that Moderna is also looking at this area with us. A candidate still in pre clinical testing and development. So they're also a little bit behind there, but that really is the new frontier. The COVID vaccine companies are able to kind of leverage what they've developed and add on to it the flu, which we know if all predictions come true and we do have to deal with this annually, that's going to be pretty useful vaccine candidate. And on Julie, I understand that quest diagnostics is out with some good news now on virus testing. What's happening there? That's right. Speaking of combo flu and COVID, a quest has also announced now that they have a test for both that patients can access at about 16,000 locations, sorry, of their patient centers. And this of course helps with the turnaround for testing both throughout the season. We know right now we're facing both of these diseases at the same time. And in the coming months, they expect that to go up. Their testing capacity for COVID has increased and we just recently talked to outgoing quest diagnostic CEO Steve Roskowski about their capacity of 300,000 tests per day capacity. So I'm sure that is going to play a role as well and how this all plays out. Indeed, and just in time for the winter months. I'm Julie Kimlani. Thank you so much. All right, coming up, Fed 4 loud.

4795," Securization of XIV A major parallel to the XIVenary解決hymed treats Cholue A major精 We've been tracking the reaction to the Fed decision that didn't provide the relief that investors were hoping for with more of the play by play and how this all unfolded in the markets out of the markets. We've been tracking the reaction to the Fed decision that was going to be a little bit far there because there's a dance that evolved yesterday we had all the fireworks that was Wednesday but we got some leaks a couple weeks ago so let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive I have all this plotted out and what we're going to start with is a chart of spy that is the S&P 500 ETF and we're going back 12 days so here's the current price all the way on the right but 12 days ago in October 21st that was a week ago last Friday we got this tweet in fact it was an article two by Nick Timorossi's the Fed whisper over at the journal he said the Fed is barreling towards a fourth straight 75 basis point rate rise at the November FOMC meeting that meeting could serve as a critical staging ground for future plans including weather and how to step down to 50 basis points in December step down is a key word there because later on that morning Mary Daley well she had some confidence she's the San Francisco Fed president and she was at an event and she said in my judgment more is needed for restrictive territory that would be more rate hikes and she also said we need to watch how restrictive we cannot overtight neither this requires a step down there's that language into smaller increments of hikes hikes and the step down should be considered now but the data is not cooperating that's because inflation is too high we should think hard about step down but we're not there yet and we can see what stocks did now this is over several days and there were a lot of other factors I mean we fold in earnings into this yes but we reached a critical level in spy that corresponds to 30 excuse my excuse my drawing here 3,900 in the S&P 500 you can see price was kind of sticky there this was an ideal entry for shorts based on technical considerations and I just want to show you what happened yesterday because we did get and I'm going to put a two day view we did get a spike up on the announcement I'm going to relieve or I'm going to remove some of these annotations here we got that spike up and that was on the FOMC statement they added some key language here I'm just going to highlight and read it real quickly they don't usually change the statement that much and so changes are really in focus in determining the pace of future increases in the target range that's of their federal fund rates the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial development so in other words they're saying yeah we know that we've tightened a lot so far and that's just fine we're aware of the lag effects and markets seem to like that they thought everybody they thought Jay Powell in the fed were stepping up to a step down that would be in December now I have some comments from Al if I'm going to be interviewing him he's from the macro compass in an episode of Yahoo Finance uncut next week really excited about that but I just want to really I just want to show a few things that he said about that he's quoting Paul he's saying the income and data since our last fund excuse me incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the terminal rate of fed funds will be higher than previously expected and we will stay the course until the job is done what's far more important now is how long rates will be paying high and we will stay the course until the job is done stay the course risk management is key here if we were to over tighten we could use our tools to support the economy later on that is we could dial things back and fix it but if we failed to tighten enough inflation would become entrenched and that would be a much much bigger problem so contrary to the fed over the last and now 10 20 30 40 years since falcor guess what they're going to air on the side of tightening too much and if you want to ask",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,86,2022-11-03 19:56:57
4796," bigger problem. So contrary to the Fed over the last 10, 20, 30, 40 years, since Volcker, guess what? They're going to err on the side of tightening too much. And if you want to see what they're really talking about, if you hear Paul saying, we will keep at it over and over. This is the reason why. Keeping at it, guess what? That is the title of Paul Volcker's book. And he was a one fighting inflation way back in the day. He was. And it was really amazing just to watch the volatility that we saw play out specifically yesterday afternoon. The markets wanted to cling on to any note of optimism. But Fed Chair Powell's comments really solidify that the Fed is far from done. At least it sounds like it's going to keep at it. They're going to keep at it and they will stay the course right. Chair of like a great job breaking that down. Thanks so much. Coming up for counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. We'll be right back. Great. in the red. Yeah, who finds this is a nice phrase. A closer look at the selling we're seeing. Hey, Ness. I Shawna. Yeah, and some selling in these final minutes of trading as the Dow has turned negative. It's down half of a percent. The NASDAQ is down 1.7% and the S&P 500 down half of the sectors were watching technology that's been leading to the downside today along with communication services but you've got energy and industrials that are in the green over on the NASDAQ 100 Apple down 4% in fact Apple down for four consecutive sessions down 10% more than 10% over the last four sessions. Also looking at alphabet that that is down almost 4% trading at its end. The SEMS are also under pressure right now. Now I did mention energy stocks being in the green. We are seeing those having a lift today with XMobile of more than 1%. Here's a closing bell for today Thursday November 3rd. There you have it. The session ending for Thursday. Let's take a look at how the market negative territory the Dow",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,87,2022-11-03 20:01:35
4797," In there you have it, the session ending for Thursday. Let's take a look at how the markets pose all three major indices ending in negative territory. The Dow there, losing half a percent, down about 148 points, there's some P500, losing more than 1 percent, they're down 40 points, and the tech heavy Nasdaq taking the biggest beating, they're down 1.7 percent, they're losing 181 points. Well, let's take a closer look at the broader markets with our markets panel. Let's bring in Kevin Flanagan, wisdom tree head of fixed income strategy, and Eric Ditton, the wealth and lion's president, and managing director. Welcome to you both. So Eric, obviously, people have had a bit of time to go through and sort of pass through some of the language that we heard from Jay Powell. What do you think the markets are focusing on the most at the moment? Drill wants to be remembered as the Paul Bocher of the New Millennium and not the Arthur Burns. And so he has made it clear, he said the path, the path is shittling for the soft landing, he will sacrifice the economy if necessary to tame inflation. And that's what he's going to do. And of course, the risk is overtightening. He recognizes that. And we're frankly, he's okay with it. So if you look at it and you break it down, it's the tech that free markets, right? And just really speaking, the dad is down 10 percent year to date, and the S&P is down around 20 and the Nasdaq is down around 30. The major tech, the more growth you have in the index, the more you're getting hurt because of those rising rates. Eric, we're having a little trouble with your audio. We're going to go into try to fix that right now. But Kevin, I'm going to go to you just in terms of the action that we've seen over the last 24 hours, the selling that we're seeing led by some of those larger cap tech names, anything in this that I guess changes your view of what we could see play out between now and your rent. Well, I mean, it goes back to the prior segment, right? I think the markets were kind of grasping for any kind of sign that we would get the PAL pivot. But what we got was more or less pivot light. Yeah, we may go from 75 to 50 basis point rate hikes going forward from here, but that doesn't mean the Fed's not going to keep raising rates. And I think that was PAL's underlying message trying to get it through to the markets that were probably going to be higher for longer, and that's not something the markets wanted to hear. And Kevin, just to follow up on that, obviously we've seen this before. We've seen this 75 basis point height. We've seen it baked in markets still continuing to be enthusiastic and then very upset afterwards. And we see a lot of selling off at what point do the markets really take this on and understand the Fed is not changing course any time soon. That's a great question. I think the underlying message whether it's stocks or in my neck of the woods in the bond market, volatility is just front and center. It's not going anywhere anytime soon. So investors, I think need to be prepared to continue to see this kind of volatile action in the markets, in the indexes until the Fed probably begins to signal the actual pivot. What is the actual PAL pivot? This when they start talking about causing and maybe maybe a year from now, rate cuts, but we're a long way away from that if you listen to what the chairman saying. But I think what's important to remember is think about where we were a year ago. We were still holding on where I should say the Fed was still holding on to transitory. So we've seen how fast things can change. But I think for now, take PAL and company, at their word, it is higher for longer. Eric, we just heard Kevin, I mentioned a Fed pivot. It's going to be a while there until the Fed actually does pivot in terms of maybe the Fed scaling back more significantly or pausing their rate hikes. When do you see that, I guess, becoming a more realistic option? Well, do you believe in Fed funds futures? I don't know if we should or not. Their track record has not been that great, but nevertheless, it's kind of like the market age sentiment we have now. So let's just take it for what it's worth. June next year, June 23, Fed funds futures are showing a new range probably between five to five and a quarter. That's at least 100 basis points higher than where we are now. And I think back to that prior segment before, you know, what PAL was saying with respect to the September dots, probably have to be lifted based upon incoming data. So I wouldn't be surprised in December if instead of 4.6 percent, the terminal rate from the vendor in thermal feeding system has happened in youngest nation maps.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,88,2022-11-03 20:05:33
4798," not probably have to be lifted based upon incoming data. So I wouldn't be surprised in December. If instead of 4.6%, the terminal rate from the Fed is around five. So we have at least, if you figure they go 50 December, 25, 25, you have at least three more rate hikes coming down the pike. Eric, is that on par with what you're expecting? Yes, I think that's on par. I mean, one thing the Fed is doing is they're really telegraphing everything. They're trying not to surprise the markets. And I think the big challenge here, I mean, if you look, a lot of the Fed's medicine is working. Oil prices, gas prices have come down, lumber, steel. A lot of things are moderating. The issue really is the tight labor market. There's two job openings for everyone, employee. And we've got a demographic shift happening here. We've got baby boomers retiring. We've got people with long COVID. And we've tightened immigration policies. And the bottom line is that the workforce is shrinking. And I think that's going to be the big challenges is figuring out this tight labor market. And Eric, on top of that in your notes, you talk about the combination of the cellophane stock bonds and crypto, making this one of the worst years for wealth destruction ever. Give us some context here. Yeah, I mean, just looking at the first six months, the market had the worst six months opening since 1970. And we actually have the worst first six months in the bond market in history. And the Wall Street Journal professed just recently that the 6040 allocation has had its worst year annualized in 100 years. When you add on the crypto, and if you want to start talking about the speculation in meme stocks and in SPACs, there has been real damage out there. We were also anecdotally seeing that individuals are trading a lot of short options, options that are on the day of expiration. That is a crapshoot as bad as they come. We're seeing single stock ETFs, super high octane. This all points to the huge amount of speculation. That's the whole mark of the tops of markets. And people are losing a lot of money right now. And big tech equals big wreck. The leaders are getting shot right now. They're getting taken out. And quite frankly, the bear market can't end until the leaders come down and they are. Kevin, where are you seeing the most opportunity in the market today given the losses that Eric was just talking about and the uncertainty over the next couple of months? Well, great question. So back, like I said to my neka that was in the bond market, I think what's interesting is that perhaps the worst record of performance that we've seen in the bond market this year isn't setting the stage for a rebound or a good year in 2023 or 2024. That may be where we're going. And I think that's an important aspect to this. If you look at Treasury yields across the curve, you keep seeing highest since 2007. Think about that. That's a generation that's 15 years ago. There's a lot of investors and advisors that have never really seen interest rates at these levels. So income has come back into fixed income. And I think it's going to be interesting that, arguably, as Eric was saying, if the Fed is making this policy mistake, the economy rolls over eventually. And we do begin to see a pause, and then, of course, rate cuts coming down the pike. You are setting the stage for what could be maybe the second half of next year. And as I said, 2024, a good year for the bond market. But still, as of now, what we would say is I'd rather be late than early to the duration. Kevin Flanagan, Eric Ditton, so great to get your perspective on the recent action that we've been seeing play out in the markets. And how big does it make sense of everything that's going on next semester joining us? All right. We have an earnings alert now.

We're shall certainly a beat here on both the top and the bottom line of revenue coming in at 8.4 billion compared to Wall Street's estimates of 8.3 billion adjusted earnings per share. Same story there coming in at 81 cents versus the expected 72 cents. US seems sour sales seeing a pop there up 11 percent international sales still down but higher than what Wall Street expected if you take closer look there down 5 percent compared to the expected down 8.2 3 percent China of course Wall Street keeping a close eye there as COVID-19 policies just begin to lift there we're seeing a decline of 16 percent compared to what Wall Street expected down 21.7 percent but the big story here customers still heading to Starbucks despite those inflationary pressures over the past 15 months the company has raised prices and was consumers on mainstream continue to push through of course Starbucks here leading to the fact that they have enhanced sore partner wages increase in new partner spending and then also in addition to that they said that the plastic strategic pricing there of course will continue to keep close eye on this as CEO locksman nor is him Han takes the role of the hell rather of CEO come April 1st 2023 of course now incoming CEO Howard Schultz did oh sorry interim CEO Howard Schultz still in place there and he continues to remain confident that this pricing that they're passing on to consumers will continue into the new year as something that consumers are simply passing through indeed thank you for that update that beat on the top bottom line they're stock being awarded there to 2.04 percent Brook to Power thank you so much all right coming up we continue our coverage of Starbucks earnings plus results from Warner Brothers Discovery we've got the for you after the break,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,90,2022-11-03 20:14:11
4800, Breathe V keywords. Dancing Potental Easy Experience Tenemos Riding contemplating reporting third quarter earnings Ali Canal has a number here for us Ali what do you see? Hi when I'm seeing is this loss of 2.7 billion dollars that is the loss of the company reported for the quarter revenue missed expectations 9.82 billion versus 10.37 billion also a wider adjusted loss per share of 95 cents. Director consumer subscribers also missing expectations 2.8 million versus around 3.3 million and that's despite the success of house of the dragon we know that there's been increased restructuring charges at the company macro economic challenges like foreign exchange further subscriber losses in linear television and a slowdown in advertising that's pressured profits for the quarter the company's debt load did fall slightly compared to the second quarter from 53 billion to 50.4 billion while advertising revenue decreased to 2 billion versus 2.7 billion in the second quarter now the stock is trading relatively flat it's up slightly in after hours trading the company did reiterate it's 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between 9 billion and 9.5 billion they had previously lowered that so perhaps that the fact that they're not lowering that adjusted EBITDA guidance again it's giving investors a little bit of confidence in this company but Warner Brothers discoveries just one of those media giants that has really been struggling we heard from Wells Fargo Steve K. Hall he described this company as one of the best assets in media coupled with one the worst balance sheets in media so you know we'll see what the company has to say on the earnings call I expect potentially more layoffs are reported 1000 plus positions have been eliminated so far so we'll have to see how investors continue to react to this. Right again the stock though holding onto gains despite those weaker than expected results that we did get at least on the top end bottom line and I'm going to clarify the the the miss was a 2.3 billion dollar loss not I think I said 2.7 2.3 billion loss 2.3 billion dollar loss there for Warner Brothers discovery revenue of 9.8 billion missing at the streets estimates Michelle. All right well shares of Starbucks trading higher after putting those fourth quarter earnings there up almost 3% where Bush securities managing director Nick Setchon joins us to help break those numbers down good to have you back Nick now we know you had a neutral rating on the stock and a price target of $92 what did you like in his earnings report. Well the US comp is you know clearly on fire here including positive transactions so you know the company they will pass on 10% you know average check growth and still managed to get 1% positive transactions that that that's clearly bucking the trend here in the restaurant industry and then on top of that you know despite the China was the rest of international X China is doing better as well so so the rest of the markets like Japan South Korea are actually carrying China along right I mean so the consensus estimate for international including China was down 8 came in down around 6 so a beat on international as well despite China headache. Yeah Nick that's interesting here because clearly the results are very strong once you take out the weakness that we are seeing out of China but as we enter the next couple of months which at least from now looks like it's going to be pretty choppy we could see more of a significant slowdown here in the US where Starbucks clearly out performed last quarter what you read on what we could see this current quarter and looking ahead into next year. Well so I mean I expect the guidance to be very positive relative to expectations the question is you know despite the guidance what actual results will look like as the year progresses in the near term at least through the you know first half of of their fiscal year so the holiday season and then fiscal you know Q1 ending in March.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,91,2022-11-03 20:18:33
4801," In the near term, at least through the first half of their fiscal year, so the holiday season and on fiscal Q1 ending in March, or calendar Q1 ending in March, I expect them to continue to have high signature comps in the US, even with negative transactions. So I see very little risk to current expectations around FY23. And Nick, a lot of people looking for some cues as to how the consumer is feeling about things doesn't seem to be the case though, for Starbucks, even same store sales growth, up 11% people also spending more higher foot traffic. Then what do you think consumers are driven to Starbucks, whereas we're seeing some other retailers really struggling? Well, you know, interesting thing is restaurants across the board have been doing very well this quarter, not a single restaurant, with the exception of a couple of, you know, company-specific cases has missed so far, with about 85% of restaurants reporting. So every single restaurant, practically every single restaurant has beaten expectations, and has given very solid guidance, especially around the top line. And that's being driven number one by by extraordinary price increases, but even with those big price increases, the gap versus grocery is expanding. So grocery prices are seeing higher year-over growth rates than the restaurants number one. So that's helping restaurants become a relative value as ironic as that sounds. And then two, we're still benefiting, restaurants are still benefiting from this. You know, I don't want to stay home. I want to go out and enjoy experiences as opposed to, you know, ordering goods online. And so restaurants continue to benefit from that tail as well. Nick, what about the price increases over the last 12 months? We've seen prices rise by about 5%, do you think more in store? I think more in store. But I do think that because grocery starts, grocery prices are rising faster. Rough restaurants are not in danger as much as, you know, first blush might indicate. All right, always good to have you on next set in there. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Thanks. Well, earnings for eight continues. Good to have you. The earnings for eight continues with shares of Coinbase. They're trading lower after the company releases the quarter earnings report. We have your finances, David Hollerith, joining us now to break down those numbers. Hey, David. Hey, Rachelle, it's not looking too great. You know, we sort of have a forward, we're able to look in advance on this because we can see how global crypto trading volumes have done since Coinbase gets most of its revenue that way. And so it was expectedly bad. And we're seeing a revenue, a top line revenue of about 590 million versus expectations for 649 million. So at Miss revenue, it also missed bottom line, which is adjusted earnings for share was a minus $2.43 cents versus expectations for $2.12. So, and adjusted EBITDA, which is sort of, you know, a quick way to gauge how much cash Coinbase is burning came in actually lighter. So they are working on their adjusted EBITDA. They set sort of a $500 billion loss on adjusted EBITDA for the end of 2022 as sort of a guard rail for the company. More recently, as of yesterday, the head of product from Coinbase is left and the company is making significant restructuring around that area. So while cryptocurrency companies do definitely talk about building in the bear market, Coinbase grew so much in 2021. And now this looks like they're in the phases of, you know, trying to get in shape as bear market. So that's what we have so far. All right. Thank you for that update. Coinbase trading is slightly lower as we mentioned their dayfeller. Thank you so much. All right, coming up. Warner Brothers Discovery shares edging lower on earnings.

4802," Go visit PCC upon join the gallery carpet and press like button chi We're gonna brothers discovery reporting third quarter earnings results. You can see the stock now off just around 2% revenue coming in a bit light at 9.8 billion. The street was looking for 10.3 billion. Also subscriber ads, slightly missing expectations of the company adding 2.8 million subscribers during the quarter for more on this. We want to bring in parent analytics director of strategy and Yahoo Finance is Ali Kanau, excuse me sorry Julia Alexander, skipped over your name there Julia, it's great to have you. I guess just first your reaction to the numbers that we did get because we're seeing the stock off just around 2% initially actually moved higher on the news. We're all trying to scratch our heads. So what's your initial takeaway from this? I think the fact that the guidance, not the guys per se but looking at the projected EBITDA kind of being in line with where we'd hope that it would be is kind of giving us a little bit of a lift that we needed. Because if we look at Warner Brothers discovery, it's a three-pronged company dealing with three different issues right there is a theatrical business that is dealing with a slow down return to theatrical and we're considering 2022 compared to 2019. We look at the cable business there is a decline in the linear base and there is a potential decline in the ad spend as we had in 2023. And especially of course if we look at the DTC side of things where the operation cost for the revenue side of that is really going to be an ongoing conversation over the next few years. But I think a big part of what we see when we look at these earnings specifically is that 3.5 billion targeted for synergies. That means that we're going to see a lot more cuts coming both to the programming side and the labor side. We're talking about a company that's already dealt with a billion cut in programming that's cut about a thousand jobs if not more. And so I think the fact that the company is trying to approach even more in synergy is while deeply unfortunate story across the board for both programming and labor is the type of news that the street is looking for for a company that's trying to really raise",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,93,2022-11-03 20:27:27
4803," company is trying to approach even more in synergy is while deeply unfortunate story across the board for both programming and labor is the type of news of the street is looking for for a company that's trying to really rain in all of their spending in those expenses and that 50 I think 50 billion dollar that that's kind of sitting over their head. Julia, you just listed several risks for this company, both macro economic risks and then business specific risks as well. What do you think is the biggest challenge that Warner Brothers discovery needs to tackle right now in this moment. So that they don't lose those investors that they can really get on top of these problems as quickly as possible. It's a company that is trying to it's a legacy company of yes fear that is trying to be a future company of tomorrow right and so what does that mean. One they have to get those those operation costs under control and bring up the revenue in the profit side of DTC. They need to prove that this is a type of product that people are going to jump ship for that including that declining linear base. What they want to do is kind of bring that declining linear base over to the DTC product and prove that there is a profit to grow over the next several years. Whether or not that's going to happen is the question on top of everyone's mind. And especially as we're heading into a period of increased inflation we were already there but a potential bigger session kind of hanging over our heads. You know whether people want to pay for something like HBO Max when they're cheaper you know ad tier supply ad tiers over at Netflix now is a big question. So if we look at HBO Max one of the advantages that it has is according to our data the demand for the films looking at films across all major S FODs. It's actually the largest it's it's close to 20% of all demand for film sits on HBO Max but demand for the platform itself is actually decrease in the last quarter meaning that people are trying to find their entry team in elsewhere and if that demand continues to fall away from HBO Max even with it shows like House of the Dragon. It really puts a curve on how how much that platform can grow and if you're trying to tell your investors that we understand the the gross carpet market profit margins on linear are much stronger there on streaming but we really believe this is our future you have to be able to convince them that there's this is a product that's going to grow and go the next several years and right now that is something that I think a lot of their investors and shareholders are not sure about. And you Lou, we know the ad revenue story has been hanging over a lot of these streaming companies just how much exposure does Warner Brothers have to this how much is this damaging some of their some of their Q3 earnings. I mean Warner Brothers Discovery's a cable company first and foremost their businesses ads you know I like to say that television is advertising and advertising is television and although streaming seemed to curb that for a while because it was operating from a place of total monopolization under one company. There's now this factor of well every company is trying to grow their stream service and surpass that ceiling of maybe 900 million subscribers in the United States and Canada regions where the vast majority of their profits are coming from in terms of when we look at that ever driven for user. So strongest in the United States and Canada when we look at Discovery Plus and HBO Max and all the other DTC platforms alongside cable and linear that discovery really relies on to make up the bulk of its business. It's the most volatile because we look at Disney Disney has a parks business it has a it has a cruise business that other businesses that I can take in from if we look at something like you know a Google that has a YouTube right YouTube and add business but there's a bunch of other businesses coming in from Google that even when advertising on YouTube is hit there's advertisements on search and there's other places that go from if we look at again a con cast right they saw huge decline in their linear customer base but they have other means of including Robin in all the less declining it's still a very sound business if we look at Warner Brothers Discovery it is simply a cable and entertainment business and so the advertising really declines that affects them more than some of their other competitors. Julia real quickly here and we think about media mergers obviously Warner Brothers Discovery was one of the biggest from this year who do you think could be next and is this going to be the norm moving forward especially amid this competitive landscape. I think Sherry Redstone would like to offload Paramount as a whole as fast as possible I think that happens in the next couple of years but I really do think you know the NBC universal Warner Brothers Discovery although both sides of the equation continuously say that they don't see that happening that really does make a ton of sense and what we're looking at from the consolidation side as you can't just scale to scale that's not going to create a great product when order to compete with some of the apples and the designs or the world you really do need to have a skill will product that appeals to different teasplusters and different audio demographics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,94,2022-11-03 20:31:21

This is a merger with rival Kroger still faces regulatory approval. Joining us now to help us make sense of all this is Yahoo finances, Alexis Keenan. Hey, Alexis. Hi, Shana. Yeah, so these state regulators really not liking what they're hearing from Albert Sins in the supermarkets announcement to plan to sell its company to its rival Kroger. The deal was announced on October 14th and it's worth $24.6 billion. And if that's approved, that would join two of the U.S.'s largest supermarkets. But what's really rattling feathers here is Albert Sins plan to pay its shareholders this special cash dividend. It's supposed to pay that dividend on November 7th and that is well before the approvals that would come from the Justice Department and the FTC to say this merger is okay to go forward. Now the cost of this payout, Albert Sins says, is about $4 billion. It could reach por Tax fingerprints when it's on sale with our advantage. I'm starting to try to work on that Linux $1 million.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,95,2022-11-03 20:36:19
4805," become from the Justice Department and the FTC to say this merger is okay to go forward. Now, the cost of this payout, Albert, since it's about $4 billion, and that is what led the state attorneys general to ask for this payment to be delayed. But the company denied that. They said that the state AGs have no legal basis for asking for this delay. The states are arguing that the payment really will leave the company under capitalized at a time when it's really uncertain whether the deal will get that final approval. So on Tuesday, we had the Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, he filed a lawsuit and then followed by that was a Wednesday lawsuit from the attorneys general for the DC Illinois as well as California. And they're asking a federal court to step into intervene and issue a restraining order so that payment cannot be made. They point out to that that $4 billion is roughly equal to all of the company's liquid assets. The company has a market cap of $11.1 billion. Also, in a statement, Albert Sins called the lawsuits merit list. They said that these AGs just really don't have the legal foundation to go forward. Shawna, we will continue to watch. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much. All right, well, Ukraine is receiving more Western technology support as Russia's invasion of the country continues. Today, Microsoft said it will extend its technology support free of charge to Ukraine throughout the end of 2023. The finance is editor-in-chief Andy Sauer, spoke with Microsoft President Brad Smith to discuss how the tech giant plans to help Ukraine's digital infrastructure during these difficult times. Take a listen. You just pledged $100 million in technology support to the country of Ukraine here at Web Summit. Tell us about that. Well, we committed $100 million in additional technology aid to take Ukraine through all of 2023. Throughout this year, part of what is sustained Ukraine is moving their digital infrastructure into the Microsoft Cloud, into our data centers across Europe. We've been doing that free of charge. This will ensure that Ukraine, not just the government, but critical infrastructure and other services, can continue to be resilient, can continue to serve the people of Ukraine. You're also here to talk about climate and fighting climate change from perspective of Microsoft as well as sort of more broadly speaking and going on to Shawna. I'll shake after that. What are your priorities here, Brad? Well, I think when it comes to climate, one of the things we've recognized is that digital technology data AI are really a foundational enabler for all of the innovation that is needed. The energy transition, the other climate changes that are needed, even the work of the 3900 companies around the world in every part of the economy that have made a climate pledge. So part of what we're doing is advancing the use of that technology. We have our cloud for sustainability that companies are using to record and reduce their emissions. We have other technologies that startups are putting to work. And we're also looking beyond the technology itself. We're taking steps to put our house in order and we're really working to advance sustainability skills. One of the things we've recognized is like the digital era, we're now entering a sustainability revolution that is going to require that people acquire new skills relating to climate technology, climate science. And so we're working to support that as well, including through LinkedIn, which is part of Microsoft. Let's talk about Microsoft's business a little bit. Obviously the stock is down, big tech stocks are all down. How much does that have to do with valuation? How much does that have to do with the underlying business? Your earnings report was pretty solid. Some concerns about cloud growth. Where do things stand? Well, I think we've entered a lot of macroeconomic headwinds. Everybody's earnings reports have made that clear. At the same time that we're going through a cyclical change in terms of a recessionary period of time, we look at longer term secular changes. This is a decade where AI is going to accelerate. I think we'll see quantum computing come online. We're really going to see the integration of cloud infrastructure, more use of data, more use of AI, more advanced forms of computing. And I think part of what is important in a time like this is both to manage a business if needed to go through a recession.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,96,2022-11-03 20:40:04
4806," Vance forms of computing. And I think part of what is important in a time like this is both to manage a business if needed to go through a recession and enter it, but perhaps even more important. Stay focused on what will it take, what it will take to exit the recession. And we're focused on that as well. And it's clear that that will involve some big technology bets, and we're continuing to stand behind them. You're obviously here representing Microsoft, but in a sense, big tech here in Europe, how are relations between the European regulators and big tech companies sort of writ large right now? And at a better point than they were maybe few years ago? I think regulation is moving forward. That's undeniable. I think there are more conversations taking place between tech companies and regulators. I don't think it's uniform. I think that some of us are trying to adapt. Others are still resisting or fighting. One of the points that we make in Europe is that the digital infrastructure that we create is really designed to deliver more profit to a country than anything that we're going to make in that country. It's really this factor of production. It's what every country needs, every company needs to continue to innovate and remain at the forefront of competition. So that's part of our conversation. And last question, you mentioned LinkedIn. There's another social media platform out there. Twitter, Elon Musk just bought it. How successful do you think Elon will be in fixing Twitter, if you will? Well, Elon Musk is undeniably one of the greatest technology visionaries of our generation. Twitter has been a great partner for Microsoft, not just as a business partner, but in the societal space. Just a month ago, at the UN General Assembly Meeting, Microsoft and Twitter came together with the US government and the New Zealand government to talk about how we could work together to keep children safe online. How we could address the risks of violent extremism. And I very much hope and believe we'll have the opportunity to keep working, working not just as a business, but to address issues around society. At the end of the day, if you looked at LinkedIn, I think at LinkedIn, we really strive to use it as a platform that I'll say, creates more light than heat. And in the world today, there's a lot of heat, not just in the climate of the planet, but in the climate of discourse. And I think we should all strive to ensure there's a little more light and let's see if we can't advance civil discourse along the way. Thanks to Microsoft President Brad Smith and Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Sauer at the Web Summit. All right, coming up, the metaverse is one of the most buzzworthy words in tech these days. We'll find out which companies are doing it right and roll when we come back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,97,2022-11-03 20:44:43
4807," Two What even is the metaverse? Well companies like Meta, Roblox and even Microsoft have invested billions of dollars into this concept that no one knows when will ever come into fruition. We have young finances, Ali Golfingle with us now and she's put to an expert all about this. Ali. Hi, our shelves great to see you. So I sat down with Kathy Happel, Chief Metaverse Officer for Journey. She's been dubbed the Godmother of the Metaverse and the first thing I asked her was to define the metaverse. Let's just define our terms and her answer surprised me. Here's what she had to say. I don't seek to define it. I seek to build it. I think that you know we're spending a lot of time trying to define it, but if someone wants a textbook definition, they have to wrap their heads around the idea that this is the next iteration of today's mobile internet. So the successor state of today's mobile internet is about virtual shared experiences that happen both in virtual spaces, but will also happen in the physical world. That part just hasn't been fully enabled. It is a further convergence of her physical and virtual lives and it's kind of the concept or an idea of the internet being more immersive, more 3D kind of all around us, being more social, more persistent. So I felt a little bit free by that flexibility, Rachelle. It definitely surprised me because I've encountered a lot of very technical definitions for the metaverse. She even said that she isn't sure we're going to call it the metaverse in 10 years. Like the corollary I thought of Rachelle was the worldwide web. When was the last time you called the internet the worldwide web, right? That's true. I mean, I guess that'll be a tough break for meta then since they change their whole name because of it. But then a lot of people are wondering then what will the metaverse actually look like? We sort of get some sneak peeks from some companies like the Sail Roadlocks. Kathy's answer also surprised me here, Rachelle. It's not going to just be about products. It's not going to be about the Quest Pro or avatars that have that are made of legless torsos. Here's how Kathy described it. I've seen so many articles are like I spent 24 hours in the metaverse and like they were in a headset going into work like Horizon or VR chat. And that's great, but that's not the metaverse per se. Those are like lowercase metaverse platforms. That's what I call them. So right now accessing the metaverse starts through gaming, being 100% honest, through gaming, through augmented reality. So yeah, this is the thing. In my mind, we also always think of the metaverse as a place we go to. We have to go there or spend time there. But eventually, you know, it's just going to be the internet all around us, right? So it's going to be stuff that we do every day. You know, the reality here is two things that are very important is we're moving away from potentially replacing our phones into potentially some type of wearable like your glasses, you know, potentially with data being you're seeing that data. So it'll be all around us. It won't be like a place that we go to. We won't have to necessarily sit in front of our computers in front of rectangles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,98,2022-11-03 20:48:50
4808," So it'll be all around us. It won't be like a place that we go to. We won't have to necessarily sit in front of our computers in front of rectangles. So we're sure that, you know, right now it's gaming and say are and the analogy I thought of, you know, again, web too. Do I live in my Google Chrome browser? Maybe in some ways, but certainly not in others. I mean, you have to wonder if Snap was ahead of the game with the Snap glasses that sort of came in wet. If they don't really hold on for another decade, Ali Goffi, cool. Thank you so much for that update. Great stuff. So, all right, Michelle. Let's take a look at a couple of these trending after hours, checkers. We have DoorDash, Twilio, PayPal, Block, and Carvano. Let's kick it off with DoorDash again. I'm just around 15 and a half percent after our very strong results from the company revenue up 33% on year-over-year basis orders up 27% from year-go to 439 million fourth-quarter guidance, also beating the streets expectations. We're seeing that reflected in the gains after hours over the past three months of the stock still off just around 40%. On the flood side, Twilio is thinking just around 16% after hours despite the fact that they reported a narrower than expected loss and revenue beat the streets expectations. It's all about fourth-quarter guidance. That trailed estimates here. We're seeing that reflected in the stock after hours over the past three months. It's off just around 33%. The CEO will be joining the show tomorrow. So we'll be asking him about these results. Let's take a look at PayPal. Out of just around 8% after hours, net revenue, topping, expectations, adjusted EPS also coming in better than expected. Total payment volume, though, missing by just a bit. Another big headline in this report, the company will be working with Apple to enhance its offerings for PayPal and Venmo. Over the past three months, PayPal's stock is off just around 21%. Let's take a look at Block. That's up nearly 12% after hours, EPS and revenue, both beating the streets expectations. Bitcoin revenue, totaling 1.76 billion. That was a slight miss of 1.8 billion, but pretty much in line. Gross profit of 1.57 billion. That was better than what the street was looking for and we were looking gains of just around 12% over the past three months, so Block Off, just about 39%. And wrapping up with Carbana, the stock off just around a 7% after hours, tumbling on a revenue miss, 3.39 billion. Estimate was for 3.7 billion use vehicle sales. Just to over 100 in 2000, the street was looking for 114,000 so light sales there. That's being reflected in the stock after hours over the past three months. It's off about 58% year to date. That stock off, look at that, 93%. Michelle. All right, well, my stock to watch the Thursday is Hershey. Now, the candy giant was recording earnings ahead of the open tomorrow and for food companies, it's been a strong third quarter. Now, revenue is expected to rise more than 10% from a year ago while earnings are expected to decline slightly. And something you may not know, Hershey is one of the top performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year. It's actually up 20%. Now, one of the keys to her strength as of late, focusing on the US business and expanding beyond candy. Some of its other brands include Skinny Pop Popcorn, one of my favorites, and of course, Pirates Beauty. Well, stick with us, coffee lovers rejoice. Those holiday drinks are now available at Starbucks and Dunkin' and we'll sample some of what they have to offer after the break.

4809," then Out of the power ball and the size of the price for Saturday's draw has risen to $1.5 billion. A third largest jackpot in US history. If you manage to beat the odds of around $292 million to win, you'll still have inflation to deal with. Strategy is key. Winning payments can be given as an annuity in 30 installments or in one lump sum. Most pick the lump sum because YOLO, but financial advisors say in this environment, it might not be the best option. It's worth remembering the cash value prices actually the amount of money needed in the jackpot to fund the annuity. As the fed raises rates, bigger jackpots can be paid for with smaller cash on hand. If you take the money as a lump sum, inflation and tax will take a big portion of it. But at least you get it all at once. You might not live another 30 years. Hopefully you all do, but just in case you don't. You want to enjoy it while you're here, right? I hope you do. I hope everyone watching lives another 30 years. It is interesting when you start factoring in inflation into this and what this could mean. Just in terms of whether or not you are going to take that lump sum or if you're going to go with that annuity option. No winner has chosen the annuity option since 2014. So yes, we're in a very different economic environment, but it's been quite some time since someone has shown, I guess, some of the restraint and chosen that annuity option. Either way, you're getting millions and millions of dollars, whether it's a lump sum or over the next 30 years. So not a bad option, either way. All right, the holidays is officially here. At least at Starbucks and Dunk and the two coffee chains are back with their holiday menu line of Sprook-Depamma is here with the details and some treats. Sprook-Depamma, I'm this coffee that we have, but what can you tell us about? What we could expect this year. Right. Well, funny enough, you, me, Rachelle, all of us, we all have cold brews or ice lattes right now. And that just goes to show the larger trend that is the cold beverage. About two-thirds of Starbucks sales are actually cold beverage right now here in the U.S. Right here on set though, we have Dunkin'. We have the new cookie butter cold brew. Now this looks pretty intense here. It has sweet brown sugar. It's sweet brown sugar. It's big cookie flavors. It's cold brew with nodes of the sweet brown sugar, but Rachelle, I know that you have one of my favorite drinks in sort of my life. It's good, actually. You have the iced sugar latte over there. I do. So this is the iced sugar cookie almond milk latte, which is good because anytime I get something, I always do pick the almond milk option. I've been very good and haven't tried it so far, so I'm going to take a little sip. Let's go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,100,2022-11-03 20:57:41

I've been very good and haven't tried it so far so I'm going to take a little sip as you guys take a sit to it. Let me know what you think of your holiday drink. So this is way to sugary for me, Brooke. I think from your reaction. I think you like me. You're a little startled. I think when you thought it is good though. I see why people get them and it does kind of get you in the holiday spirit. It tastes like the holidays if that's a two. I have to say anecdotally this morning at Starbucks. There was Christmas music playing. Well, there was there was Santa has no time on all the the partners there which they call their employees. But truly this just like really speaks to not only the beginning of the holidays and at least for myself, but also for so many customers out there and it also translates into sales. We saw the pumpkin spice latte sales certainly spike at the end of August. So it seems like these companies Starbucks Duncan always one step ahead when it comes to getting out those holidays. And one more reason for people to come into the stores. Richelle, real quick, what did you think of your drink? I love this. This isn't too sweet. This is this is just right. I like it. It's made me feel more festive. All right, I gotta go for that one next time. Brooke, as always, thanks so much for breaking down what we could get this holiday season at Starbucks and Duncan. We'll have to do a press today on Yahoo Finance. I'd be sure to come back tomorrow afternoon 3 p.m. Eastern time. We'll see you then.

4813," or in tune to draft kings here. That's a simple DK NG in tune to it because of the sports fandom here. You're seeing those shares down by about 16 and a half percent after posting a loss of dollar per share for the quarter. And despite topping revenue estimates that's working in the company, saw net interest expense losses grow heavily from last year for draft kings. This is a good time to be a sports fan in Philadelphia, but also who's looking across the number of different sports that there are more opportunities to bet on. And it's a larger question of where draft kings may be able to move forward even with their partnerships, ESPN and draft kings. That was a huge conversation at least in terms of the reports that were emerging that they may be looking for a tie up somewhere. And that would be, I think, incrementally incredible opportunity for them to tap into, especially with the amount of broadcasting that they would have access into there. Yeah, a little bit surprised by the market reaction. This was a pretty good quarter. User metrics look strong. They also paired their loss expectations for the year, but maybe it's just the market wanting some signal of when this company might turn profits. Maybe so. I don't know. Like I said, a lot of them are paying attention to EBITDA numbers as well, and that's sort of not... I don't know. I don't know what's going on with draft kings either. Well, it's such a massive cost for them to take on customers. The customer acquisition costs and the marketing expenses that are company in draft kings or any of the different sports books that have a mobile first approach. They've got to spend a ton of money just to get people on the platform and then retain the 1.6 million average monthly, unique paying BTC customers as draft king classifies them. That was an increase of 22%, but the expenses on the other side too, just to get new customers that continue to come in and offer them money to bet on the platform first out, that they have to put out there on the table as well. This was what I was fumbling around trying to find. I was saying that a lot of investors are focusing on the EBITDA on the cash flow number for these companies, and that forecast is bad. That's what I was fumbling around to say. The company says, for 2023, it's adjusted EBITDA loss will be $475 to $575 million. Analysts have been looking for a loss of $426 million. So even on that adjusted EBITDA basis, the company is looking for wider losses than have been forecast. So that is the problem here that they're maybe not pushing at least in the vague direction of profitability as quickly as the street wants to. So draft king's fumbling before football Sunday. There you go. There you go. You're at the headline. I know we got to go to break, but one other number that could be an interesting kind of consumer budget tightening indicator from draft king's moving forward is this average revenue per user, per monthly, unique pay, or at least $100 in the third quarter. And that is an increase year over year, 114%. But if you eventually see that start to turn down, that could mean that some of the users are tightening how much they're willing to gamble and put out there in the sports betting market. And what's the cost of acquiring that customer? I'm betting both of you getting yelled at right now in the selection. Yeah, we probably are right now. Yeah, coming up. We're going to stop getting yelled at. Coming up on the other side, the short break. Yahoo, fine, this is Jared Blickery. Gonna break down the latest market action on the back of the October jobs report. That's next, sorry, I'm against it. Music",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,1,2022-11-04 13:42:02
4814," she We're taking a look at the major averages this morning on this jobs day in America that Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. They're all in positive territory all by nearly a percent on the Dow. It's up by about nine cents a percent and then fractional gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Let's get on over to the Wi-Fi Interactive Zoom in this morning to Jared Blickery. This is Rob's Day in America. I'm hearing a James Brown tune in my head living in America. Let's go to the board here. S&P 500, up about nine tenths of a percent. Let's check out the five day price action still hovering around the bottom end of the range there kind of digesting that news that we got from the Fed and Chair Powell on Wednesday. I want to take a look at a longer term view of the S&P 500. This is three months. Market is behaving very technically. This is in contrast to what we had most of the summer, even in a lot of September. I'm drawing these lines here 50 percent and that's called the halfway back of that movement right there. 3,900 huge, huge level here. We stopped there for a few days, sold off, but guess what? We hit the 50 percent retracement the halfway back of this bullish movement. Now we have retraced to the 50 percent. You get the picture here. So basically the market is coiling for a big move. We don't necessarily know where that is going to go next, but I do want to show you what has been happening in the bond market. Here's a five year Tino yield hovering near decade-old highs. It's down just marginally here. 10 year Tino yield up about two basis points. So not too much movement in reaction to the payrolls report. Then we have the US dollar index. That had been a little bit stronger early after the report, but now it is shifting down strongly. So that's kind of sending the opposite reaction that we might have expected. And I just want to point out that, remember a few weeks back CPI came out. It was expected to be a very bearish reaction in the market because it was a bearish print. But guess what? We rallied that day. If it's the same thing going on, we might expect something kind of a bullish reversal in the future. Let's talk about China stocks for a minute, Jared, because there are still some reports percolating about what a wind down of the zero COVID policy or softening of it would look like. It would look like this writ large because you're seeing a lot of dark green on the screen. Oli Baba, 4.5% Lee Auto, 9%. All of these stocks have been hit if not absolutely obliterated, not only in the last year, but the last two to three years. So we're seeing a lot of red here. This is a year to day look here. But nevertheless, take a look at the five day price action. We're seeing some movements, some positive development on this front. China is still a huge wild card. But I got to say in the midst of all this uncertainty, if in fact China were to give definitive inklings, not inklings, definitive motion towards a reopening, towards an end of the zero COVID policy. Guess what, guys, I think that could provide the bullish impotent for the market, for the S&P 500, you get above 3,900 and for that short covering route.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,2,2022-11-04 13:46:07
4815," I guess what guys, I think that could provide the bullish impotent for the market, for the S&P 500 you get above $3,900 and for that short covering rally, a lot of traders are expected. All right, Blickery, thanks so much. All right, Ms. Ernie's estimates and serve up we've got and set your own risk according to the spoke. There have been 20 stocks that have fallen 20% plus on their earnings report this season. Only 10 companies have gained 20% plus on their earnings reports. Coming up, we'll get more commentary on that October at Johns Report when Goldman Sacks is for pre-gill on the other side of the brick. As we've been discussing job growth remains strong in October, stoking fears around continuing inflation and more importantly continued interest rate increases because earlier this week, Jay Powell, chair of the Fed, described the labor market as overheated without any real signs of softening. Thank you for being here. Thank you. gain in non-farm payroll employment, exceeded expectations, but actually if you look on a historical basis, when you are in a tight labour market, companies tend to pull forward their hiring for the festive season, so that might explain the beat on non-farm payrolls relative to expectations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,3,2022-11-04 13:50:30
4816," a tight labour market, companies tend to pull forward their hiring for the festive seasons, that might explain the beat on non-pronged payrolls relative to expectations. And then when you looked at the uptake in the unemployment rate, that was in part due to developments on labour force participation, but that data tends to be very volatile. So I don't think it is a game changer between now and the December meeting. We have two more CPI inflation prints and another labour market report. So that is the sort of top tier data that financial markets are going to be focused on. Gryffrey, is a recession the only thing that might bring people who have been on the sidelines of labour force participation back into the workforce? Well, the issues between labour supply are varied. So there was a structural element to it, prior to the pandemic, the US had lower male labour force participation relative to other advanced economies for various reasons. As a result of the pandemic, as I'm sure you're well aware, some people are excited to the workforce for childcare reasons, addressing that requires structural reform and policy. Some people like in the UK, for example, are out with long-term sick due to COVID. Again, there's a lot of uncertainty around that. I wouldn't say that you necessarily need a recession to improve labour force participation. There are other ways to do that. But big picture in the near term, the rebalancing of the labour market that is needed to bring inflation back to inflation target consistent levels is going to require a reduction in labour demand because policy makers have sort of given up hope on the improvement in labour supply. And that's why we're very focused on what happens with job openings and what's happening in the labour market reports. Grapri, how do you think the bond market will react in front of what looks to be another series of rate hikes coming? Well, what's interesting is an analyst in my team is looking at fixed income spread markets in response to the four-fed 75 basis points rate hikes. And we've actually seen that those risk assets largely become acclimatized to this pace of rate increases and it was well-flagged. And in July, actually, you saw a rally because there were hopes of a bad policy pivot. So I think lots of lots will depend on those three P's that everybody is focused on right now, which is the prospect of a pivot and the pace of rate hikes and that peak in the policy terminal rate. We think that the bed there is increased prospect of a downshift to 50 basis points and we're going to move towards a slower pace of tightening but potentially for longer. And that's actually consistent with past developed market central bank hiking cycles. In our view, actually, the rapid repricing in bonds at the front end is largely behind us and actually we think it's a very opportunistic environment for investors to add exposure to high quality short-uration bonds lending to a high quality company or government for a short period of time is a very attractive alternative to the still very low rates that retail investors earn on bank deposits. That's interesting, Geprita. And when we look at the benchmark tenure, for example, how should we think about the relationship between the yield there and the Fed funds target rate? In other words, for example, if the terminal rate is 5% what would that imply for the tenure? Well, we're in an environment where they are both sick equal developments at play in terms of what the Fed is doing to cool the economy to address inflation. And that is impacting the US yield curve and US rates. But big picture were also contending with structural inflation forces that imply that inflation is going to be higher than the last cycle. And so I would say where rates ultimately settle is still in flux. We like the policy makers have to be very data dependent. We have to be humble in our outlook and very nimble in adjusting our views and our expectations based on what the data is telling us. But I would say we do think that we are going to be transitioning into a higher inflation environment for investors. The last cycle was all about low rates and this view of there is no alternative to riskier higher yielding assets.

So Tina's giving way to Bob and there are opportunities in high quality short duration assets like I mentioned. But until we reach peak policy hawkishness, we do not think it is wise to have long-awakeration exposures. Copy that. Thanks so much, Grapri, good to get your perspective on this important day. Goldman Sachs, Assets, Management, Global Fixed Income and macro strategist, Grapri Gill, thank you and we'll be right back. Let's get another check on markets here. Now we are almost 90 minutes after the jobs report and just about 30 after the opening bell this morning. It stops already giving up some of their gains that we saw out of the gate here this morning after the jobs report showed a gain of 2,000, 1,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked up a little bit to 3.7%. But we do see stocks pairing their advance. Earlier we saw major averages up more than 1%. Now the NASDAQ which I have been leading is up just about 2 thirds of 1%. Coming up, what do those October jobs numbers mean for unions? We are going to speak with the president of SEIU International and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.

I'm Brian Sasi, once I Julie Hymon and Brad Smith, U.S. economy added, 261,000 jobs in October, the unemployment rate coming in at 3.7% better than expected showing continued resilience in the U.S. labor market. And for the latest pulse on U.S. workers, we have U.S. labor secretary Marty Walsh joining us very shortly. And a tale of two fintechs, PayPal and Blocks spending different stories for investors, Alan's Mark Palmer will join us to break down the earnings parade. And later on, we'll dive into Funko, a shares crater following its latest quarterly report. First, let's get to Brad at the Wi-Fi, Interactive Brad. All right, let's take a look at the Dow Jones industrial average kick things off. At this, the top of the 10am hour on this Friday, congrats. You've made it to the end of the week here. Dow Jones is up by about 1% right now. Nasdaq composite, you're seeing that higher by a little more than 1% as well, the SCP-500. You're also seeing that hold on to gains by about 1.1%. Let's just put this in a five-day context to see how the week is rounding out. Overall, S&P 500 over the past five days still lower by about 3.5%. Nasdaq composite, that too in the red. Actually, the deepest decline of the U.S. major averages this week. And then additionally, you're seeing the Dow Jones industrial average over the past five days still lower. So, we've got solid movement at least to end out this trading week. And that's on the back of today's jobs report. Also, taking a look first at the sectors. And I'll come back to this retail and apparel segment for a hot second in a moment. But the sector activity that we're seeing here on the day, we've gotten a little more mixed. And actually, now we have more laggards than advances here. Take a look. Energy is up 3% here on the day. And actually, let's put this in an intraday view. And now we're in the correct correlation there to today's activity. We've got a total of 11 S&P 500 sectors in positive territory. And then just briefly going back to those apparel names that we've been tracking. As there's been some fresh news out of Adidas, as they've named a new CEO. Beyond Golden, going to become the CEO of Adidas. And so Adidas is up by about 14% right now. At least the shares that trade overseas are right now. So we'll continue to watch that. But moving forward here on the day, the U.S. has added 261,000 jobs in October while unionizing efforts continue to make its way through the labor market.

4819," Added 261,000 jobs in October while unionizing efforts continue to make its way through the labor market. Starbucks made one of many companies all too familiar with workers unionization efforts. Here's what's the F.O. Rachel Regieri had to say on the matter. We truly believe a side-by-side relationship with our partner is the very best path forward, but we respect the process. What we're focused on is continuing to create the very best experience for our partners. We know that that has worked for the last 50 years and we're confident it actually underpins the success of our new era of growth. So that's where we're focused. And to take a closer look at the labor movement in the U.S. and workers' rights, we have Mary Kay Henry, International President of the Service Employees International Union. Thank you so much for taking the time here with us this morning. First and foremost, just got a get your reaction to what you heard from the Starbucks CFO. Well, if that was the case, then workers would be at a bargaining table and being able to have a say directly on the job. And instead, the Starbucks is choosing to fight tooth and nail closed stores when people unionize. And we really welcomed the day when the CFO's comments are the reality with Starbucks because the partners love that company. And they want to see it at the table and a voice on the job and to be respected, protected, and paid what their worth. Mary Kay, Julie, I'm curious if you've ever had an experience where a company has said, come on in. Yes, we're happy to have union to your, let's go. I mean, is it much more than norm to have more of an adversarial relationship? Well, there's been periods in American history where employers have said, come on in. When Kaiser Permanente was founded in the 40s in California, it opened as a healthcare provider that all the jobs were union. And today they have the highest patient satisfaction and the employee satisfaction in the healthcare sector. Harley Davidson, it was a conflict with those workers, but now the United Steel workers and Harley Davidson have a very good relationship and the company's profitable. So it's true. I think what you're saying, the norm in the U.S. economy is for corporations to resist workers who want to join together. And we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that I believe are driving wages up, even though wage growth is slowing as we have this terrific jobs report this month. And I think that's why we're going to continue to see workers joining together at Starbucks, Amazon, fast food, airports, and across the service and care sector because people want to turn poverty wage jobs into good jobs that they can raise their families on. Mary Kay, what would getting it right look like for Starbucks? Are you talking $25 an hour and guaranteed 40 hours a week? Well, getting it right would be recognizing the union at the 250 stores that have already voted to join the union and allowing workers who want to file for elections. The ability to do it without their managers interfering with it or changing their schedules or moving people around stores. The continued anti-union campaign should stop. That would be a way to get it right. And then ultimately, it would be terrific if Starbucks would break with major corporations in the U.S. and do what they do in other countries around the world and set a national bargaining table where there could be a standard as you're suggesting that the workers and the corporation could figure out together. This is in a climate where corporate profits are at an all-time high, highest in 70 years. And so that's why I think the Starbucks and Amazon organizing is connected to the economic health of major corporations here in this country and around the world. And it's why things would go so much better if employers would stop resisting the union and start respecting the right of workers to decide for themselves whether they want to be in a union. Well, it's also driven by the workers shortage, right? That, you know, it's hard to find people to feel those positions. And so we've seen this period of a little bit more of the power being.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,7,2022-11-04 14:07:33
4820," on a B and a union. Well, it's also driven by the workers shortage, right? That, you know, it's hard to find people to fill those positions. And so we've seen this period of a little bit more of the power being put back in the workers' hands. But that might be about to shift again, right? If we're heading into a recession, if we are going to see the job market sort of turn around in the next year or so, could that also change the dynamics for unions? You know, I actually think what's driving workers to join together in unions is beyond the shortage and is about the two-year pandemic that people just work their way through and had the experience of their co-workers get hardest hit by the pandemic because people were showing up every day, often without the personal protective equipment they needed. And I think when people continue to work and we're facing life and death choices, I've heard this directly from nurses, retail workers, fast-food workers, they decided that when their employer started to resist them and threaten their job, it was like, okay, if you're going to threaten to fire me, after I just spent two years risking my life to show up to work, then I probably don't need this job. And that's why I'm going to join together with my co-workers and create a collective bargaining agreement so that workers can be respected on the job, protected in their health, and paid what they're worth. Mary Kay Henry, SEIU, International President, good to see you. Have a great weekend. Thank you. All right, the U.S. economy created 261,000 jobs in the month of October. Let's get more of a pulse on the jobs market with U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. Marty, always good to see you here this morning. You're taking these job numbers. I mean, certainly, the good job numbers were low unemployment. I like seeing that every month. And what was starting to see, I think, is nice as a slow-steady growth in our economy. And I think that we're not getting, certainly, the slowdown that a lot of people want to see, or alleging they need to bring the inflationary pressures down. But I think we are sat in the sea slow-steady growth that we move forward here. Do you believe that we'll see more people come back into the workforce, those who have perhaps sat on the sideline for one reason or another, whether that's childcare, or whether that's the coronavirus pandemic and workplace issues, whatever that may be, that they'll start to come back into the workforce. If we do see a deep recession, or at least a more pronounced recession. I think we'll definitely see more people go back into the workforce. I mean, there's lots of job openings in the country right now. And we were talking about that this morning, what I went out of the office and BLS, just to see where the job openings are. And when you think about job openings, the largest job openings in our country are in lower paying jobs. They're in hospitality industries. And yet, we're sat in the sea people come back into the workforce. And they have higher skills and degrees, and they're looking to get into better paying jobs. So right now, as we move forward here, we've got to make sure we're partnering jobs with people and what their ability to do is. And I think that that's something that we have to really think about moving forward. At least that's what I'm thinking about moving forward here at the Department of Labor. Marty, maybe some of those people going to be in these jobs will be laid off software engineers. I don't know, because we're hearing about, or people who are looking for job in that sector. And there's not that job anymore. We're hearing about a lot of tech companies that are either cutting or freezing hiring right now. There's just a report that Elon Musk, now that he owns Twitter, is going to cut 3,700 people there. I know that you had talked to Musk in the past regarding his build out in Texas for Tesla. Now he's cutting jobs in his other business and his newly acquired business. I'm just curious what you think about that sort of flow of jobs there. Well, certainly, one thing in this jobs report, that's not reflected yet in this. And certainly I'm keeping a close eye on that, because I dig the tech sector in the United States over the last several years, certainly has grown. And those are good paying jobs. And those are jobs that are in lots of cities like Austin, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, out in New York and Chicago, places like that. So I have to dive into that a little more. We haven't seen, I don't think a lot of life, actually, but there's been lots of talk of layoffs and freezing hiring. So certainly that's something that would concern me, because they have good paying jobs. And a lot of states and cities and places around the country have built out expansion of their cities, whether building new housing, things like that. It's for this exact sector, this tech sector. So it's something.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,8,2022-11-04 14:12:03
4821," A lot of states and cities and places around the country have built out expansion of their cities, whether building new housing, things like that. It's for this exact sector, this tech sector. So it's something that I'm interested in. I'm going to dive more into and certainly offering right now to any tech company out there, anything that we can do at the Department of Labor to help you in a situation. I'd love to do that. As far as Twitter, I mean, that's a whole different situation. I think that's, I don't know enough about it, but I think that's Elon Musk in looking at the business model. I'm sure at some point that will fix itself out as it moves forward. While we have you, we do know that there's been a move from New York City, this recent, of course, in the salary transparency that's come forward. And regardless of what started, it's gotten off to. I think there is still this broader recognition that there can be more room for salary transparency that is beneficial to both the employee and the employer. What would you like to see on that front as New York City has already rolled this out, perhaps where some other cities and states could also have that type of transparency that leads to a more healthy employer employee relationship and kind of reduces some of the parity issues in pay scale? Yeah. Well, we did that in Boston. When I was the mayor of Boston, we had 200 companies in the city that gave us the pay data. And anonymously, we were able to dissect it and really work on pay equity and making sure that women and men would pay the same. We made some really good gains in the city of Boston. It wasn't heavy handed. The companies came to the table. These are the large corporations. And I think having these conversations are really important. And coming up with policies moving forward are important. We were successful in the city of Boston. They're still, hopefully still doing it in the city of Boston. But in other places, it really is about having these conversations and not just to pay equity and transparency, but also in leadership of companies and getting women on boards and things like that. And all of those important aspects of growth and moving forward, legislation has passed often about pay equity. We shouldn't, women shouldn't need legislation to be paid the same as a man. Women should be paid the same as a man for doing the same exact work. And that's something that not just elected officials, but CEOs of companies should work on. With 2022, the time has come to make equity in the workplace consistent. Mr. Secretary, this jobs report just continues a string of really solid, to strong labor market reports, but it comes against the backdrop of slowing or declining productivity in this country. I do you think the hustle culture this country was founded on is just done? Yeah, my economy just, they went over that with me yesterday. And I was trying to get a good reason on how we measure productivity in the United States America. And I think that we're still working through that. I mean, I think the productivity America is strong. I think that when the terminology of quite quits came up or all of that happening, I never heard it in the communities. I haven't heard it when I was out there talking. I think American workers are still working strong. They're working, getting paid, but on a lot of construction sites, I've been in a lot of manufacturing facilities. Those workers aren't slowing down. Those workers are working hard. So I think that, again, I don't know enough about the data. I don't think the data is consistent or strong as it should be, to really tell the true story of American workers. All right. The US Labor Secretary, Mari Warsh, always good to see you. Have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. And we'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,9,2022-11-04 14:16:27
4822," You Now it's some other headlines that we're watching at this hour. Saudi Arabia's public investment fund or PIF says it will make electric cars in the kingdom under a joint venture with Apple supplier FoxCarn. That's part of a push to build new industries and lessen the nation's dependence on oil. FoxCarn will develop the electrical architecture of the vehicles and seer will be the name of the first Saudi automotive brand to produce electric vehicles in Saudi Arabia. The PIF said its cars would be available in 2025 and seer is projected to contribute 8 billion dollars to the kingdom's GDP by 2034. Chrysler parent Stellantis warning nearly 300,000 vehicle owners immediately to stop driving their cars after three crash deaths tied to faulty ticata airbaggin-flaters were reported in the last seven months. The do not drive warning is currently in place for owners of previously recalled 2005 to 2010 Dodge Magnum station wagon, Dodge Challenger Coops, and Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans that had not addressed that airbag issue. And Aldi is doing a Thanksgiving price rewind in an effort to draw customers to its chain amid surging inflation. The grocery retailer lowered prices for its Thanksgiving dinner food items to match 2019 prices. That means discounts of up to 30% for select items. If you recall, we reported earlier this week that Walmart announced a similar pricing strategy, but they're just rolling it back to last year's prices. That would be in about a 15% discount. So Aldi saying, no, no, no, we're going all the way back to 2019. Hold my perky. Wait a minute. Something like that. Hold the gravy, whatever. Anyway, it has been a rough year for the semiconductor sector. First companies such as AMD and Nvidia could not get enough chips to supply customers. And now slowing PC sales are hurting the industry. Shares of chip makers, they've been sliding all year and it could give worse. Sazzy is here with his take on this one. Yeah, nothing like dumping this negativity on a day when all the chip stocks are up. And nonetheless, highlighting a good note from cities, Chris Daly. Really one of my favorite chip analysts out there on Wall Street. And he's offering up some good reasons why the sell-off in chip stocks and the socks index or the Philadelphia semiconductor index might be really ripe for further another sell-off here. First, industrial end market demand is rolling over. Red flag there as well. Auto sales are in fact cooling. A lot of chips, of course, get used in various automobiles. PC and handset demand are correct. And we heard that. We have heard that within the past two weeks from the likes of an Intel and an AMD, that PC correction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,10,2022-11-04 14:20:46
4823," that used in various automobiles. PC and handset demand are correcting. We've heard that. We have heard that within the past two weeks from the likes of an Intel and an AMD. That PC correction is alive and well and it has been very ugly for a lot of players. And even too, the handset market as well has been correcting as we learned from Qualcomm's warning yesterday. And then lastly, companies are more tightly managing capital expenditures. It is full on. It continues to be budget planning season in corporate America. And we're starting to see a lot of, I would just say tighter cap X budgets for next year. Maybe that means a fewer less chips. Now of course, there you can see that affiliate, I'll see a semiconductor index on the screen right there. That has been, it has not been a good year for that, not a good year for an AMD and Nvidia, many other players in that semiconductor index. Daily things, EPS, estimates for chip stocks can tank at least another 20% from where they are now. That would be a big plunge and likely put further pressure to his point on the stocks. And that the stocks index could plunge at least 15% as those earnings estimates come down. And might take here, in search of bottom, it definitely brings up a couple good points on what would ultimately cause that bottom in chip stocks. For him, it is the end market no longer correcting, valuation just reaching levels that are truly trough and no more cap X cuts. And I'm trying to figure out why I'm in a basket. Is that what that is? I think that's a basket of trash can. It's a trash can. Wow. That's a waste. That's a waste. That's not a waste. That's all. That's all. It looks like a wicker basket, like a laundry wicker basket. Yes, so if it's a trash can. I feel like I should. I know who made it and it's a trash can. It's a trash can. Okay. Well, we'll see what happens with chips. I mean, it depends on the time horizon you look at. Because it's interesting when you talk to some investors and they say chips obviously are still going to meet them. Yes. And so if you're an investor who's looking at five years, ten years, you might have, if you have that luxury, you might have a different sort of assessment here of what this group looks like. Yeah. Look, AMD's business is still growing. Qualcomm is still growing. It's just a matter of they're not growing at the rates that they were and the growth rates have really, really, really stalled. I think that Qualcomm report was just not good on many accounts this week. Yeah. And it's a lot of things, many of which you pointed out and you're taking today's side. I was appreciated. Guys, coming up, payment platform, round up. We're going to break down the earnings from Block and Paypal with BTIG's Mark Palmer. That's coming up next. Yeah.

4824," // Ritual DistANK sucks shit out of reach Payment platforms block and PayPal. They are on the move today, but in divergent ways after PayPal cut its full year revenue forecast while blocked. So 51% pop in its cash at business year over year. D have, it is offering a bank account substitute to consumers, particularly in the lower end of the income spectrum, who really benefit from those types of services, especially to time when a lot of banks focusing on their own profitability are growing up the gates and letting less consumers to start bank accounts within their platforms. So it's got a mission critical functionality while at the same time it's seller ecosystem, which is basically allowing points of sale payments, has remained robust, which we believe is largely because the company is offering tools to small businesses and medium-sized businesses that enable them to better manage their payment needs. Mark, it's Julie here, it's good to see you, talk to me about CashApp versus Venmo because I sort of think of those in the same bucket, although I know CashApp has broader applications. Is CashApp taking share from Venmo, or is it just expanding the pie entirely and signing up different and new customers? Yeah, we believe there are very different use cases for Venmo versus CashApp. Venmo historically had more of a social element, it has more of a focus on a somewhat higher income demographic than does CashApp. So it doesn't really serve as a bank account substitute the same way that CashApp does. And one of the things that we really saw in the third quarter was block really leaning into the banking functionality associated with CashApp, and we expect that to continue making it even more relevant to the lives of the people who are using it. Mark, the last time I caught up with the PayPal team, they were pitching the story of expense reduction and a pivot in operating margins next year. I mean, do you agree with that? And if so, what does that pivot look like? Well, we agree that they're pivoting. If you look at PayPal today versus where it had been a couple of years ago, the orientation is just very different. A couple of years ago, the focus was on ubiquity. It was on customer acquisition. It was on the top line growth. And this is how PayPal became a stock that was trading at north of 60 times earnings. Flash forward to today, and we see a stock that's trading at a below market multiple, somewhere around 16 times earnings or a little bit below that. The reality is that PayPal has pivoted toward being what we believe to be more of a mature model, focusing not on customer acquisition, but on increasing penetration of existing customers, cutting costs to drive the bottom line. These things are crumpled in an uncertain...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,12,2022-11-04 14:29:18
4825," but on increasing penetration of existing customers, cutting costs to drive the bottom line, these things are crudent in an uncertain, macroeconomic environment, but they don't represent the characteristics of the growth stock that PayPal had been a couple of years ago. What kind of growth gets evaporated when you layer in an Apple Pay and any continue furthering of their own Fintech ambitions as well? Yeah, you know, it's interesting because one of the things that PayPal has done historically is rather than try to fight some of the big tech titans who were getting into payments, they've collaborated with them. You know, we saw this with their tie ups with Visa and Mastercard a few years back. You know, more recently now we're seeing PayPal collaborating with the lakes of Amazon and Apple, trying to maintain their relevance and frankly, we believe that the announcements that the company made with regard to you being able to integrate Apple's tap to pay, things of this nature are making its payment functionality more robust, but when you back up and look at the bigger picture, the question is how is this company going to be able to sustain growth? They're guiding initially to 15% earnings growth in 2023, but at the same time, they're making a lot of statements about the vulnerability of their end consumer to an uncertain macroeconomic environment, thus putting that 15% growth in a very risky position right out of the bat. Mark, you're out here this morning keeping your buy rating on Coinbase F their earnings last night, but taking your price target to $110 from 220, when will this company live up to its promise? Well, I think that's largely a function of what's going to happen in the end market. Coinbase can and is setting itself, but it can't control the wind. And the wind in this case is the crypto market, which is very much correlated with risk assets in general and as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten, the outlook there is very much uncertain. So what are we seeing? We're seeing Coinbase preserve its optionality by focusing on maintaining a large cash balance, building out its institutional crime brokerage platform, and continuing to add new functionality and areas like staking that are relevant to those in the crypto space. So I think what we are seeing now is a lot of building that's going on not only in Coinbase, but among Web 3 platforms in general, in anticipation of getting a bit more of a tailwind so that you can see the full realization of the platform's potential. BTIG, managing director, Mark Palmer, always good to see you. Have a good weekend. It's a talk to you. Coming up, what's on tap for Disney's earnings next week?

4826," Dear happiness. between today's class or Shares of Corona are getting run over after posting a wireland expected loss for the third quarter. I mean, it's softening demand for pre-owned vehicles. Product supermaid joins us now. Pros not a good quarter from Carvana, but again, more pressure on the shares here. Yeah, it seems like these high rates are really hurting there. You know, most people with Binance, there's their cars, 40 million Americans buy used cars every year. Carvana, I'm gonna tell you about how this is a rate-sensitive kind of purchase. Like he said, big miss on the top and bottom line. Gross proper vehicle down a thousand bucks year over year. That's a huge kind of like decrease in your profit margin there. So, you know, they said things would get worse for them to get any better. So there's not much there for them to kind of like hopefully hang their head on soon. But, and then in the ice going to the cake is they suspended their guidance, right? So they can't kind of see what's next, given how uncertain things are. So, you know, the Carvana business model has been hurting all year, right? As we've sort of seen things kind of slow down, rates go up. And the question is, is this rock bottom and then are they going to kind of like, you know, it's a good product, right? It's a really easy thing people like buying their cars online. So it's like it's got value that the question is, can they make it a profitable venture? We also saw some news this morning that Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, their selling shares of a China-based EV maker. So can you tell us more about that? So many years ago, BYD, Berkshire bought a pretty significant stake in BYD by 20%. They've held on for about 10 years and they started selling little slivers of it. Starting this late this summer. This is the third, I believe third sale they've done. Another, I think I believe another three million shares here. They sold about a million and a half also in September. So it's still, they sold over 200 million shares. So it's still like a significant kind of holding. But the question is, is Warren ready to kind of exit this? If they made a lot of money off this stake, they bought it for 225 million, I think 10 years ago. And now it's over 10 years ago. And now it's worth 7 million, I think. So the question is, when is it time to exit? Does it see as a long-term Buffett player? Is it time to sort of like re-evaluate? Interesting. We saw those shares rallying just now along with other Chinese stocks during the session. So interesting. Thanks, boss. Appreciate it. And also looking ahead to the Walt Disney Company next week at Central Port Earnings. We see the shares up about 1.5% or so today. There is a lot going on when it comes to Disney from the parks around the world. Remember, we just had reports of Shanghai Disney being shut for a bit because of COVID there to the streaming landscape here in the US a lot to consider. And considering all of it, is our Alexander going to have things here with us unsaid? Hey, Ali, so what's the sort of big picture numbers you're going to be looking for? Well, clearly we learned a lot from Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount. When it comes to the state of the market right now, obviously the weakening ad market impacting their bottom line. I expect that to happen to Disney a little bit, but this company has a lot of levers to pull. I spoke with Tim Nolan from McWire. He reiterated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% of your to date, but you didn't know that over the long term this company has a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,14,2022-11-04 14:38:13
4827," He's tolerated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% year to date, but he did note that over the long term this company has a lot to look forward to. What you're looking on your screen now is a Wall Street projections. Revenue expected to come in at 21.27 billion, adjust the DPS of 51 cents, parks experiences and consumer products revenue at 7.59 billion, but a really important number is that operating income. 1.9 billion is expectation. That's less than what we saw in the third quarter, but we could see a little bit of an impact from Hurricane E in there, perhaps some of that Shanghai Disney closures. And then those Disney plus subscribers expected to come in at 9.35 million. Now what Nolan told me to watch is that direct to consumer subscriber figure. Like I said, 9.5 million expected, along with that add to your expectation. How will that add to the company's bottom line? Nolan estimated that add revenues could surge up to 800 million in 2023 thanks to Disney plus. That's sort of the overall market opportunity there. And then on the park side, you wanna make sure that gross bookings aren't going down that there's no recessionary impact. The analyst pointed out that in 2009, the last financial crisis, park revenue fell 7%. But there's a bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases, to prices, updates to the park, the Genie Plus app, et cetera. And then finally, the impact of that advertising slowdown. ESPN I think is pretty insulated from all of that. But ESPN and other big question, right? Looking forward to the company. What's the DTC future of this? Because right now it's clearly more profitable in a linear world than it is in an OTT world. But something that Bob Chapich will have to think about as well. I think there's too much optimism around Disney plus coming into the report. And keep in mind, this comes against a back to it. Look what we heard from Roku this week. A major slowdown in their business. Netflix, probably some squishy areas in its quarter as well, Power Round Plus. Now looking potentially lay people off. It hasn't been a good look in streaming. Hasn't been a good look in streaming. But Disney is not just a streaming company, right? They have a lot of different components to the business. And there's a lot of confidence that they can enter this new world and be very successful at it. If you think about advertising, Disney has a really good base in this. They've really crushed it with Hulu. They have the experience on the linear side. Unfortunately, that adds slowdown. There's not much you can do with that, right? There will be some overhang there. We'll cloud the outlook overall. But overall, I think they're in a good position. They made a lot of investments to Disney plus. We have a lot of exclusive content that's coming to that service disenchanted when the ones that I'm very excited about that's coming. And I think that content spend is going to slow down significantly over the next few quarters and the next few years. And that's going to positively impact Ipa Tess. So a lot of macro concerns, but I think for this company, they're in a really solid position moving forward. And also with Disney, there's the consideration that on the streaming side too, we could see some more focus around ad tiers at a time where Netflix is rolling out and pulled forward the timeline for themselves to launch that. And so now that we've started to see that pop up in the market and perhaps see what some reception looks like, how have the early days been for Netflix? Well, Netflix just launched their ad here in the US. Yesterday, a $6.99 price point slightly below Disney pluses upcoming ad supported tier at $7.99. It's going to be a wait and see approach. We're not going to have all the answers this quarter. I think it's going to take a few quarters so we can really see that impact. I do think across the board, streamers have been exploring price increases, Warner Brothers discovery on the earnings call last night. They actually pushed up the timeline for that combo service between HBO Max and Discovery to the spring. They said there's a lot of options with pricing sort of hinted that price increases will be coming there. And so pricing is something to really focus on when we think about all of these streaming giants. And I think that's a big component that's going to be important in the quarters to come. Look forward to Disney. Woo! Let's get it. I appreciate it. Come now, we're going to check in on the state of the restaurant industry and small business. We'll see you on software company, Lightspeed. That's next. We're going to need to get a Backer logo in here. Let'sиш up below. I'm paying aakat and am doing it to the center.

4828,"cled So, if we're coming to light speed, took a hit this quarter from macro forces, including reduced customer spend at businesses, and 4X swings hitting transaction revenue. But with light speed banking on a move up market, after seeing increased spend, can it close the sale? The shares are higher today after something yesterday following the numbers, and joining us with more is JP Chauvet. He is light speed chief executive officer. JP, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. What are you seeing amongst your clients? And we should tell viewers clients are restaurants, but other types of smaller side businesses as well. What are you hearing from them right now? Yeah, so the majority of our customers are restaurants, and retailers in the SMB space. And really what we're hearing from them, it's a unique moment in time. The post pandemic world with returned physical has created a much more complexity for their businesses, because you have the physical world meets the digital world. And also what we're seeing is that it's a, you know, cost of labor is gone up, scarcity in terms of trying to hire people, and now alluming recession. So it's a really difficult time for our customers, and for the market. And here, the only way forward for our customers is to adopt technologies like cars that can help them do more with less, and automate a lot of the manual tasks. And are they convinced of that, JP? Because as I mentioned, you all had a pretty tough quarter last quarter. You're not just selling software technology to folks. You're also selling hardware in the form of a point of sale system. And are you seeing people retrench, or is it just a matter of seeing slower growth? No, so, depends what you call slower growth. We had a 38% growth the year over year. And if you look at the segment of the customers above $500,000, there was 25% growth in store count, and above a million dollars, we had a 30% growth. So we are a strong growth player. On what we can control, it was a really good quarter. We beat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,16,2022-11-04 14:46:56
4829," 25% growth in store count and above a million dollars, we had a 30% growth. So we are a strong growth player on what we can control. It was a really good quarter. We beat on also an EBITDA and we beat on the outlook. So for us, it was a very good quarter. What hurt us is what we are planning for in the future where we think there'll be a bit of softness, not in terms of our customers and demands, but in terms of the GMV of our customers. And because we are rewarded as a percentage of their revenues, of course, that's going to impact. But still, we are planning very strong growth for the second half of the year. What is the most difficult thing about operating through this particular environment from the CEO perspective? Yeah, well, I mean, you know, this short term versus long term, you know, at light speed, we are a great business. We're building a, you know, we're building a business that's going to last forever. And then you have the daily fluctuations, you know, investor feelings. But I think for us, the way we look at it, we've outlined the plan. We're ahead of this plan and we're doing really well. Now there are things we can't control, you know, currency exchange rates. We do 40% of our business outside of the US. And then the other thing we can't control is consumer buying. But on what we can control, this has been a really good quarter and, and the business is doing really well. J.P., have you followed your colleagues? Excuse me. It appears in tech and implemented hiring freezes or layoffs. Well, most of the companies that are hiring freezes are doing these are, are not companies that are growing the way we are. These are companies that were pure digital. Light speed, the majority of our businesses have physical presences. And as you know, the markets or the consumers have returned to shopping and dining in person. So we are a strong growth story. So we are actually looking today for, I think we have 360 positions open on our website because the company is going to be growing. Now this being said, we have a path to profitability. Next fiscal year, we want to be evict that positive. And we plan on doing that. But, but we have to hire enough people to sustain the growth that we are, we are currently having. And J.P., I'm curious what you're hearing from your clients on the hiring front as well. As you mentioned, restaurants, small retailers, etc. We just got the jobs report today that show there's still growth in things like hospitality jobs, for example. It has a gotten easier for these businesses to find people to hire. And that is actually the biggest issue in our industry is that it's very difficult to hire people right now. Most of the people who are working in the hospitality and the retail space found out a drawups during COVID and left the industry and they're having a hard time getting them back into the industry. So I think that's really what's hurting our customers right now. And that's why we think it's probably a moment in time and a unique moment in time for light speed because the only way out for our customers because they can't hire enough people is to have platforms that help them automate. And unfortunately for the market, the majority of the systems out there right now are legacy platforms that are really not not really efficient in terms of helping them operate in this environment. Have you seen in the data that you're able to kind of glean insights into for all of the businesses that leverage your platform, leverage your service? That there is any major pullback or shift at least in the way that businesses are being able to conduct different services, whether that be on the food front or whether that be on wherever the platform may be, if the consumers are actually pulling back on their spend or shifting dramatically how they're spending. So for now, we haven't, well, we see the big shift we've seen with consumers because we do have also delivery platforms and we also connect with all of the order head platforms. What we have seen very clearly is from the end of the pandemic to today, there's a very, there's a massive return into physical. So that means our customers are selling more and more in their physical spaces. So I think and that's really the complexity right now is that the consumers are still consuming online. They're still using delivery and order ahead, but they're also consuming in the physical space, which means that for the customers, it's more difficult than ever to manage these. And so you often see it, you know, when you go into restaurants and they have four or five iPads and each of every iPad is for, you know, a different delivery network or and that's where we can help them. We can go in and integrate those platforms and make it much simpler for them to run their businesses. So we have seen this big shift and then on a consumer basis, what we've seen is summer was very strong for hospitality. We've seen a lot of people just return to restaurants and we're.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,17,2022-11-04 14:50:59
4830," big shift and then on a consumer basis what we've seen is summer was very strong for hospitality. We've seen a lot of people just return to restaurants and we're starting to see a slight slowdown in terms of of consuming but we are still you know in very healthy healthy volumes. JP, JP great to have you here with us this morning. JP Showa who is the light speed chief executive officer here with us on Yahu of Finance appreciate the time. Thanks for having me. Absolutely everyone let's take a brief look at the markets we've had the Dow ripping to the upside right now by about 500 points on the day it's up 537 540-ish points right now 1.7% in the green the S&P 500 you're also seeing that in the green to the tune of about 1.8% and the NASDAQ composite up 1.8% as well this comes on the back of a better than expected jobs reports but mix because we did have unemployment higher than expected there you're taking a look at some of the actuals versus the estimates or what was anticipated coming into that an hourly wages that inline with expectations as well coming up everyone the earnings parade continues we've got reports from Funko virgin galactic and synomark to talk about on the other side of this break it's going to get funky You You Welcome back. It's time to prep the time and today we focus in on three separate earnings reports one minute each. Let's start with this on the day. Shares of Funko tick or symbol FNK. Oh, it's down bad right now. Oh my god. Missing yet. Oh my gosh indeed. Missing on profit estimates and the money. That's a head of the holidays. Shares moving in a manner that would make everyone bobble their head as we're taking a look at the activity on the day it's down by 50% year. Shrogg. Uh, stunning. It's stunning and it's not no it's you know, I don't think the demand met the company's expectations. We should also know that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,18,2022-11-04 14:55:26
4831," 50% here. Shrug? Stunning. It's stunning. It's not, I don't think the demand met the company's expectations. We should also note that JPMorgan now downgrading the stock. I guess what happened when your stock loses 50%. But they are implementing a lot of new, I think, just processes and machines and technology inside the company to set their foundation for whatever they're looking to do in the future. But this is a massive, massive day of value destruction for fun. It seems like it's not as much the sales that are a problem. It's the profitability that's the problem, the EPS and EBITDA really had a big miss here. And the company is now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin in high single digits for the full year. Previous guidance was around 14.6%. If you look at the midpoint, so that's a big downgrade. Virgin Galactic, we're watching those shares as well. They're up 6% after reporting a wider than expected loss for the third quarter. It did top revenue projections. And most importantly, reaffirmed. It remains on track to launch space tourism services in the second quarter of 2023 and is going to have its commercial spacecraft going up in the middle of next year. I mean, earning shmurnings for this thing. It doesn't obviously make any money yet. But it's all about the timeline here going forward. So that sort of confirmation is encouraging. No, you're making a faceprice. They're selling tickets to space. They're selling tickets to go into sub-oantoresession. Right, inter-resession. Right inter-resession. Like my goodness. Do we really expect it from me? Even the ablwinn community is saying in this economy, right? Like the people who would buy tickets to space. Or not impacted? Or not people who are getting. Yeah, they own text stocks that have been down 80% this year. Even still. I don't know. You're not sold. No, well, I'm not there. I'm not there. I'm not where they're going after. I'm sorry. I'm not buying a ticket. I don't know. Maybe, yeah, maybe on the margins. I don't know. Maybe you put it off a career. Speaking of tickets, shares of a cinema can focus after reporting third quarter earnings, eating expectations on the top line, total revenue, up 50% year over year. As we continue to see the recovery of theatrical movie going, it's good quarter-finished cinema. Not bad. Good to see you. I've been back to a couple of movies as well. So I think that there is a comeback story to be had for the movie theaters. It's just a question of how much they're going to be reliant on titles. Of course, cinema, it's really been a turnaround story that they've needed to initiate from exploring bankruptcy all the way to, okay, how do we just make sure that with any titles that make it into our theater, we're able to stave off competition at the same time. Making sure that you are able to have enough employees to operate this. I think for the experiences that I've had in the theater this year, you could do it without a lot of employees. And I hate to say that, but it is become so streamlined from the point of purchasing digitally to showing up, watching the movie, and then dipping. Yeah, well, the company's adjusted EBITDA is improving and beat estimates, so that's helping matters as well. Kind of speaking to your point about maybe cutting some costs here. The company said August and September were challenged by a dip in content availability. That's code for not a lot of good movies out there, I guess, but anyway, so we're watching that. All right, let's take one last quick quick look at the markets before we leave you. They are in the green up once again after cutting their leads now are almost at the highs of the session.

4832," MUSIC Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11 a.m. on the East Coast. Say it out here in the west. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Happy Friday to all of you. Here's what I'm watching this hour. Mixed signals in the labor market. The US has 261,000 jobs in October blowing past expectations. But the unemployment rate ticks higher to 3.7%. Those hot numbers signaling the Fed will continue to raise rates a little longer. Layoffs at Twitter, thousands of Twitter employees bracing for news this morning. They may be out of the job. It's all part of a new owner and CEO Elon Musk's plan to revamp the social media giant. We're going to have all the details for you coming up. And it is a big morning for door to ash. Shares are surging after a big third quarter earnings beat. We're going to break down the numbers for you. But first let's look at a check of the markets. We are 90 minutes into the trading day. And take a look at how stocks are responding to that strong with unexpected jobs report. The down now up more than 500 points. The S&P 500 up 60 in the Nasdaq up 150. All the major averages. Those still on track to close out the week in the red. With the Nasdaq seeing the steepest losses up today. But it is down on the week. And despite what we're seeing today. The tech heavy index on pace for its worst weekly loss in January of this year. We are beginning this morning, though, with that all important jobs number 261,000 jobs added to the US economy. As unemployment rose to 3.7% in October. Now, as we said, that's a bit of a mixed report coming just days ahead of the midterm elections where Democrats are struggling to convince voters. They can get the job done on the economy. Let's bring in Yahoo finances. Rick Newman and Rick, you know, it's interesting because we've been talking so much about these job numbers as in good news. Not necessarily good news for the markets today. The markets are up. But if you think about where President Biden has positioned himself, especially going into the midterms. Is this good news for the Democrats? I can't tell to honestly, but I mean, let's just let's start with the headline number 261,000 new jobs. I mean, the strength in the job market is astonishing. Economists keep saying we expect the labor market to slow down. We expect job growth to slow down. And it keeps not slowing down. No, we are not adding jobs at the pace we were doing right after the the COVID downturn when suddenly every employer had to catch up. But in a normal economy in a decently growing economy, if you had just 200,000 new jobs per month, that would be a terrific pace of growth. And we've had far more than that all year long and the slow down just keeps not coming. And yet I'm looking at all these analyses today and everybody's disappointed. Everybody was hoping that there would be clearer signs of a slowing job market. And why is that because everybody wants the Fed to stop raising interest rates. And in order to do that, the Fed needs to see signs that a recession is coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,20,2022-11-04 15:04:08
4833," And why is that? Because everybody wants the Fed to stop raising interest rates. And in order to do that, the Fed needs to see signs that a recession is coming, that job gains are slowing, that wage gains are slowing. So, you know, it's great that we're adding all these new jobs. And it's unfortunate that everybody is disappointed about that. I mean, with that said, right, you know, what does this mean in terms of messaging and the final days leading up to the midterms? We've heard the president go out and say, look, the economy is still strong, but voters are looking at where inflation is and saying, how do you look at both in contact? Biden cannot win on the, he cannot win this messaging battle. He has had a strong labor market to brag about all year long. And it hasn't worked. And it just tells you how pervasive inflation is. And it tells you how ruinous inflation is for family budgets. I mean, I just did some new analysis this weekend. One of the ironies here is that even though inflation is improving, the rate of inflation has declined from a high of 9% down to, it's now 8.2%. People are actually saying, giving signs that they are getting more worried about inflation, not less worried. And I think for a couple of reasons, number one, the longer it lasts, the longer people think it's going to last. So inflation expectations for the next six to 12 months are very high. People think price, these price hikes are going to stay. And I think another thing that's happening is the longer people have to deal with inflation, the more it streams their, their family budget. So, you know, we got the wage and number today average hour learning is 4.7%. Ordinarily, that would be great. But with inflation at 8.2%, your paycheck buys less. People are literally falling behind and the more, and the longer that goes on, the worse it is for the incumbent Democrats. So it looks like Biden and his fellow Democrats are going to lose at least one Chamber of Congress next week. I think the only question is, are the polls accurate? If the polls are accurate, then it's going to be a bad night for Democrats. So if Democrats are hoping for anything at all at this point, it's at the polls are wrong. And really quickly, Rick, for the Republican side of things, you know, they've certainly seen strength in the economy. At least, you know, that they see that things, at least voters are not necessarily optimistic about where the economy is headed. That's positive for the Republicans. They look at the jobs number today. How do you think they spend this one? They are there. It's the same way they've been spinning it. They just keep pointing to inflation. And that's all they need to do. So I don't think you're going to hear any Democrats saying much, excuse me, Republicans saying much at all about the labor market. They're just going to keep saying Americans cannot afford the basics. And they're not wrong about that. Yeah, just hammering home the word inflation seems to be working for the Republican so far. Rick Newman is always thanks so much for that. For deeper insight, look on what the latest jobs data means for the Fed and the U.S. economy. Let's get right to ADP chief economist Nila Richardson. Nila is Rick said, you know, when you think about the tight labor market, that has really been one of the biggest hurdles for the Fed and its attempt to cool off the economy. What are the numbers today tell you about how much more the Fed needs to do to get it where they want it to be? Hi, great to be with you. Look, the Fed may not be able to go through the labor market to get to lower inflation. I think that's what the numbers tell us today. We're seeing really steady and robust job gains. The BLS report today was pretty broad base. Little different than what the ADP numbers showed earlier this week in terms of the broadness of the hiring. But in terms of the number of jobs created, we showed 239,000 private sector jobs. The BLS was 230 free, so you're seeing the same kind of alignment when it comes to these monthly job gains. For the Fed, that means that it's not the labor market that's seeing weakness. It's things like housing and maybe stocks, but not the stock market today. So they have their work cut out for them. Yeah, it's been interesting to see the reaction and the past we've sort of seen the strong jobs numbers kind of lead to declines in the broader market. What do you put this in context for us right now? Because you said, look, it's not necessarily the labor market that the Fed has to deal with. It's other areas like housing. Are there other levers that you think the central bank can be pulling when you consider that the rate hikes they've implemented so far haven't necessarily led to a significant cooling off of the labor market? You know, the Fed has fundamentally won.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,21,2022-11-04 15:08:19
4834," The rate hikes they've implemented so far haven't necessarily led to a significant cooling off of the labor market. You know, the Fed has fundamentally won move, and that's rate hikes. Unfortunately, they can go faster, they can go slower, but they're still going to hike rates. I think what we are anticipating, at least I am, is that not just that they hike, but that they hike and they stay at an elevated federal funds rate for a period of time to bring back inflation. The bottom line is, when you look at the labor market, when you look at consumer spending, this is a long game for the Fed. It is not a short game, and that means that rates are likely to stay higher for longer than was originally anticipated by the Fed. Wage gain is certainly something we've been keeping a watch on. As we know, so many companies have had to deal with the higher cost that have come with a very tight labor market. Early earnings up 0.4% in October from the previous month, we are seeing a slight cooling down if you can call it that. But what are you hearing from employers who are saying, look, we can't necessarily fill the jobs, but maybe we don't necessarily have to dangle the same incentives we did six months ago. Well, 80 PPS1 and six workers in the United States. We have a lot of payroll data. When we look at pay growth, what we're saying is exactly what you see in this BLS report, it's exactly what Powell pointed to in this press release, that wage growth is slowing, but it's slowing to and stabilizing at an elevated level. It's still much higher than it was this time last year. So wages are not likely pushing up inflation, but it may keep inflation prolonged at the current level. And what we're hearing from our clients, especially our small business clients, is that it's still a tough time finding qualified workers, especially in consumer facing industries like restaurants, leisure and hotel accommodations. And so there's still a struggle here for the smaller firms who were out competed by larger firms earlier on in the recovery. Now is there chance to hire some of these larger firms take a pause? It's been a situation of good news, sometimes being bad news. And this report specifically, I guess the bad news that could be good news is that unemployment did tick a little higher. We're talking about 3.7%, which is still historically pretty low. I mean, how much higher do you think that number needs to go in order to see a real cooling up? Well, I focus on the real economy on the jobs market. So good jobs numbers are good news always. And I think the unemployment number we have to put it in context. It's still below 4%. It's still at historical lows. That number is coming from the household survey, which is a little less reliable. That number, the 3.7% is likely going to take up back and forth over the next couple of months. But the punchline here is that we're still seeing job gains. And if you match that data to the initial jobless claims numbers that are still around pre-pandemic levels, we're not seeing a lot of firms starting to lay off. And that's good news for Main Street. Main Street is the bulk of the economy. So that's good news for economic growth. Yeah, a lot of the layoff news largely focused on places like tech we did here, but higher increases in places like Amazon as well as Lyft. But we'll continue to watch that. And let's get to have you on today. Nila Richardson, ADP Chief Economist. And here to take a closer look at the market action following today stronger than expected jobs data. We've got Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickery standing by. And Jared, this is a big pop that we're seeing on the back of a strong jobs number. Yes, we are. And it's somewhat reminiscent to me of that big pop we got after the last CPI report, which should have been bearish by all accounts because it was coming in pretty hot. But guess what? The market is reacting pretty strongly. S&P 500 up over 1.25%. And the Dow is really outperforming. Let me just put a five-day chart here. And we can see the Dow is still down about 1.25% for the week. But it has come back to the mid-range of that five-day range. Nasdaq still hovering down below. And boy, it has been a story of two different markets here when you consider tech and the value trade that's more heavily represented by the S&P 500 and the Dow. So here's the S&P 500. We're just kind of chopping around down here. 3,900.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,22,2022-11-04 15:12:40
4835," tech and the value trade that's more heavily represented by the S&P 500 in the Dow. So here's the S&P 500. We're just kind of chopping around down here, 3,900, excuse me, 3,900, which is right here is a huge level and also this breakdown region from the Fed the other day, 3,800, also going to be big as kind of where we stop today. But all in all, I think investors will take this, especially after the carnage that they suffered just a few days ago at the hands of Pauline Cole. By the way, today materials in the forefront, that's a story about China potentially re-opening along with consumer discretionary financials, energy staples and industrials, nice mix to see their Akiko. And finally, Jared, we're seeing a pretty broad-based gains today in the market. But want to hone in on the energy space here, oil seeing a big pop today. We got that news from G7 countries that they had agreed to how exactly this Russian oil price cap would be implemented. And what more can you tell us about how exactly this is likely this way in terms of where oil prices are likely to move? Sure. The thinking now is that it's going to be a fixed price limit instead of one that varies with the price of oil. The number that I've seen floating around is $60 per barrel. You can see WTI here, which trades pretty closely to Brent Crude. That's up 4% today. I think that's more on the reports that we're getting a possible re-opening of China based on the fact that they may be rescinding the Zerocovid, or at least revising that policy here today. But there is that European, I guess, ban sanctions that go into effect on December 5th. So this is ahead of that. I don't think it's going to be a huge deal for the oil market. I think it's going to come down to the demand characteristics. And especially with these marginal swings that we've seen with respect to China, maybe a few other places. But you look at the broad complex and commodities, say, a lot of green, a lot of dark green, and guess what? We're also seeing the US dollar come down appreciably, particularly against the Renminbi over in China. Yeah, a lot of countries looking at that and saying there's some relief and slight potentially. Jared Vlickery, thanks so much for that. Let's take a look at shares of Funko, failing to get the poppings looking for after disappointing earnings. That stock is down more than 50%. That's right. The company behind the collectible figurines reported earnings of $0.28 a share in revenue of $365.6 million. That was higher than this three expected, but weak guidance for the all-important holiday season for shares plummeting. The company now expects holiday growth and profit to remain relatively flat from the same period last year. That prompted JP Morgan to downgrade the stock from overweight to neutral, the firm slashing Funko's price target in half the $16 a share. Well, coming up on the other side Starbucks credits customers adding more stuff like Syrups to their coffee for its earnings beat, and that trend continue. We'll talk to an analyst after the short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,23,2022-11-04 15:17:10
4836," Konstantina.... Well, investors giving shares of Starbucks a big jolt in the session today. That stock is up nearly 10%. The coffee chain posted a record quarter attributing its success to rising prices, even despite some economic headwinds. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Brooke DiPala, who's all over the numbers for us and Brooke, you know, the good news is domestically there are consumers who are spending more per visit, but there's some headwinds over these. We'll get to that, but let's sort of start on the domestics of the positive news first. Yeah, Kiko, some positive news here is that although McDonald's, those Starbucks is not have a jingle like McDonald's Starbucks and Wall Street are certainly singing to the tune of this fiscal fourth quarter report. Wall Street, tier today, Starbucks having the best day since May shares of nearly 10% in two hours into trading day here. Now, as you noted here, despite them setting higher prices in Q3, they did give us a bit of an estimate there that they raised about 5% over the past 12 months. But that actually did lead to higher revenue here, record $8.4 billion. Here in the US, seems to sell sales jumped by 11%. Thanks to a 10% increase in average ticket price. But just how long will that momentum continue and can customers expect another price hike? Starbucks, the above Rachel, are you are you are waiting this morning with Yahoo Finance? Really in response to inflationary pressures. We'll have some of that this year based on annualization from moves we made last year, but we expect our pricing to return to actions that are more on a historical level. What we focus on is really how do we sustain that ticket? Because it isn't just pricing, it's actually volume as well. We've seen our customers purchase more that's evidence in attach, increased attach. So we're seeing increased volume. Now some of those offerings of what they consider that are driving volumes include customization here about 60% of beverages are now customized, modifiers have grown in double digits. And that includes stuff like pumpkin spice syrup, or pepper mocha, syrup is going into your coffee. But Rachel continued to emphasize that the partners and as you noted labor inflation, certainly coming into consideration here, driving this demand that Starbucks is willing to fill, also Rachel emphasized that they continue to believe that a side by side relationship with partners is most important in this organization efforts continuum. Side note, Brooke, it looks like you and Rachel were wearing the same top. I didn't know. We have the same color. I was going to leave her drink. We were talking about China because we did see a double digit decline in same source sales there. There's been some rumors floating around this week that potentially China could ease its zero-covid policy. What more did we hear from Starbucks about what that's likely to mean for their second largest market? Yeah, well, like so many US consumer brands, Starbucks is certainly hoping and weighing and ultimately, you know, super bullish on the fact that this COVID-19 zero policy will be lifted soon. It's really taking a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,24,2022-11-04 15:21:22
4837," And ultimately, you know, super bullish on the fact that this COVID-19 zero policy will be lifted soon. Starbucks really taking a leader position here, ultimately weighing in and continuing to grow. Now there's nearly 6,000 stores opening up in China. And Rachel emphasized that they're actually moving towards a digital there in the midst of mobility not being back to where it was pre-sendemic. She said that 44% of the overall sales are digital now. And then once mobility lifts, they expect those stores to operate and continue to grow. Howard Schultz also super optimistic here. He strongly believes that they will come out of this pandemic as the number one Western consumer brand. So certainly something that's keeping eye on and will continue to follow how exactly that performs on Wall Street. Yeah, that's certainly been a key market for Starbucks for a very long time. A book thanks so much for that. Let's give the conversation going on Starbucks. We've got Sarah Senator, Bank of America, Senior Restaurant Analyst. Sarah, let me just start with your takeaways from the numbers that we got. A bit of a mixed results. I mean, positive things are moving in the right direction, but still some headwinds abroad. Yeah, I would say more positive than negative. So from the perspective of the US, you know, certainly one of the, if not the best, same-store sales numbers, we've seen come out of the earnings season this quarter. The fact that they had 10 points of check is certainly a reflection on, you know, as as earlier was said, people adding food, people customizing. But also, you know, they said they did have positive transactions, which is a real rarity in this operating environment right now. So that combination was really, I think, very unique and a testament to how strong the brand is and the affinity that customers have. You know, outside of the US, very, very strong results with the exception of course of China, where we know lockdowns led to really intense mobility constraints. But even there, the same-store sales were better than people had anticipated. So really recovering very nicely when some of these restrictions are lifted. And again, I think a reflection of how strong the brand is and the ability to start with connected with consumers in that market. And is well positioned as when the lockdown restrictions ultimately are lifted. You know, Starbucks are only not unique in raising some of their prices. We have seen so many food restaurants, you know, really try to make up for the additional cost they're having to pay for. But I wonder how much more pricing power you think Starbucks has? Well, I think you make a very good point there, which is that Starbucks is not unique. And in fact, Starbucks has actually taken less price or smaller price increases your rear than most in the industry. So if you look at the consumer price index for food away from home, which is restaurants, you see that that's up, you know, 8%, 9%. I think about 7.5%, 8% year-to-date more recently. If you look at some of the other restaurants in the industry who have reported 5%, 6%, which is what Starbucks says on their menu is actually very low end of the range. So typically we're hearing prices more in the 8% range. McDonald's took 10 to pull away, took about 11 and a half on their menu. So to have 6% price increase your rear really is exceptional, but only in the sense that it's lower than what you're seeing at most other restaurants. And finally, Sarah, I want to get back to the point you made about China. I mean, certainly the expectation seems to be that if there is some softening on a zero-covid policy activity picked up, people go back into stores. You know, these are all positives, especially for retailers like Starbucks, but we're also looking at some significant downturn in terms of the economy, in terms of the broader growth that we're seeing on employment higher in the second largest market there. What's a realistic expectation about how much Starbucks can return to what extent Starbucks can return to pre-pandemic levels in China? Well, I think, you know, a couple things. One is just in terms of thinking about the pace of growth that Starbucks has in China. Big part of it has been new unit growth. So same-store sales will certainly be prior to COVID, or healthy in that kind of 3 to 4% range, but really the big driver of growth and a value creation for Starbucks and for Chinese consumers has been opening up new restaurants. So, you know, the expectations that they can continue to do that at a low-down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,25,2022-11-04 15:25:37
4838," of growth and a value creation for Starbucks and for Chinese consumers has been opening of new restaurants. So, you know, the expectations that they can continue to do that at a low double digit pace, certainly if you look at the store base, you know, it's roughly 6,000, that compares to the U.S. of over 14 or 15,000. So, you know, think about the relative size of the population. It certainly would seem to suggest that they're targeted about 9,000 stores in China's eminently achievable. So, I don't see reason to think that that universe has to slow. To your point, you know, Starbucks is very cognizant of the economic pressures facing the country, but I think, you know, what they have done so well in the last few years is really adapt their loyalty program and make sure that they can really speak directly to customers one to one, which I think is very important at all times, but certainly as consumers are thinking about their budget, as they're thinking about where they want to spend their discretionary dollars. Sarah Seneswar, Bank of America Senior Restaurants Analyst, it's good to talk to you tonight, really appreciate the time. Well, coming up thousands of Twitter employees to be losing their jobs today already a lawsuit in the works on the back of that. And we're going to tell you about it after the break. We're going to have some executive visitors. We know everything in meteor for four times more than 30瑈 hit the message. We already begun it at twitter thousands of employees are expected to employed by the company coming just one week after Elon Musk acquired the social media company. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexis Keenan, who has the details. Alexis, we know there's also lawsuits here over these layoffs. The timeline, we were told 9 a.m. Pacific is when employees are likely to get the notice, but it sounds like some of those have already gone out. Yes, so Akiko, here's what we know. We're expecting that these layoffs could be impacting as many as 50% of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,26,2022-11-04 15:30:14
4839," Some of those have already gone out. Yes, so Akiko, here's what we know. We're expecting that these layoffs could be impacting. As many as 50 percent of Twitter's workforce that noticed went out yesterday telling employees that they would get word as to whether they still had a job by 9 a.m. Pacific time. But Twitter has said that it is necessary to do these layoffs, to place Twitter on a healthy path. That's what the company said, according to the Wall Street Journal. And over the past five years though, we should also note that Twitter's ranks have indeed swelled in 2021. The company added about 2000 jobs. That was a jump of 36 percent over 2020. Now the lawsuit that you mentioned, that was filed from employees yesterday. Employees that still had their jobs. Only one of the plaintiffs, purporting a class action lawsuit in California's Federal District Court, saying that they believe that they are anticipating these layoffs and because of them, they would like to say that Twitter is violating a law called the Warn Act. Now there's a state level law for that as well as a federal law. And what it requires is that employers that have 100 or more workers, they have to give 60 days advance written notice when a layoff is going to impact 50 or more employees at a company or a third of the total workforce. It also applies when there's going to be a single site layoff that impacts 500 or more employees that one applies within 90 days. Now there are some penalties associated if there is a violation found by the court. Those penalties include back pay of those 60 days that the employees would have missed, as well as $500 per day per employee so those numbers can add up. And also medical expenses if employees were to have to incur medical expenses without medical insurance during that period. There are some exceptions, though, to that rule and we would expect that in defending itself, Twitter may invoke some of these defenses and they include unforeseen circumstances, business circumstances for the company. So that lawsuit, it's a little bit early having been filed yesterday, but I would think that the court, if those employees are in fact fired, would then give them the opportunity to go forward. But again, it is a class action that is purported to be on behalf of all employees that would be similarly situated. There's certainly a lot that's happened in the week since Elon Musk acquired the company. One thing we know he's not happy about is companies pausing their ad buys on Twitter and he tweeted this a short time ago saying Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups pressuring advertisers. Even the nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists. Extremely messed up. They're trying to destroy free speech in America. We've already seen a number of major companies, at least one major agency saying we want to just hold off on advertising anything until we get a better sense of what this platform looks like. I mean, how is this exit likely to accelerate? Yeah. So it's hard to say, Akiko, you can see there on the screen. These are the companies that have actually come out and publicly stated that they're going to do a pause. They're going to wait to see what content moderation will be about at Twitter under Musque. We have General Mills, you have Vokes Wagon and Audi as well as Pfizer and General Motors. So that's just a few. As far as these groups, we don't know exactly who Elon Musk is talking about. We are reaching out and we will ask him who exactly he thinks is exerting this level of pressure. Okay. I like the screen and on top of the story, thanks so much for that. Well, Twitter is not the only company doing layoffs, lift, stripe, and open door. All announced this week, they're going to be cutting their staff for other companies that are not doing layoffs, but they're not hiring either among them are Qualcomm and Amazon, which says putting a pause on hiring, quote, new incremental hires. Even apples reportedly freezing hiring because of concerns about the economy flowing. And we continue to see that list, especially of tech companies, pausing or cutting jobs growing longer. We're coming up door to ashes, delivering for investors and consumers are still spending on food delivery. Can that growth continue?

This is a very strong quarter for door dash at a time when we've heard about consumers pulling back on spending. But we did hear the company caution that consumers spending could deteriorate faster or greater degree than we anticipate. These are their words. What did you take away from the numbers we got yesterday in terms of how these higher costs are starting to weigh on consumers and how that could potentially affect things on the platform? That's an interesting question. Thanks for having me. I think there's a couple things going on that are sort of encouraging to investors this morning. One is what you just point out is the resiliency of their demand, their gross order value growth. It was up substantially, including with an acquisition they did in Europe, which I was concerned about, called woe, which was up 60% year over year from a much smaller base, but still very good growth. And the second thing is I think what they're doing and which was smart is providing a little bit more insight into how profitability is growing. So there's a lot of investment going on, which they've always advertised since the IPO, but now they're providing insight into the core growth in their restaurant business where their profits are up like 50% year over year. So there's a lot of good incremental money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,28,2022-11-04 15:38:29
4841," insight into the core growth in their restaurant business, where their profits are up like 50% year over year, and where they're seeing very good incremental margins. So I think that was encouraging as well to investors. Yeah, the good news for DoorDash is that users are still on the platform and ordering. It did sound though that like they're starting to see some trade downs. It's not necessarily the high end restaurants have used order from there. You're still on the platform, but you're ordering from other areas that may come with a cheaper price point. When at what point do you think because of the higher cost overall, some users start to say, well, maybe I don't need that delivery as frequently as I used to use it. Well, it's also important to remember that when you look at their numbers, there's inflation embedded into their top line, right? Because you're buying a pizza that costs 10 or 15% more than it did a year ago. And then when you look at what's going on with the consumer specifically, what they think they're seeing is smaller basket sizes. So maybe instead of ordering that extra egg roll or the extra pizza, you're being more proficient with how much leftovers you want. So that's happening as well. I think in general, if you look at consumer trends, they are generally holding up because one, this is a very under penetrated market. There's no area where they're more than 10% of their available market, whether you're geographically or by restaurants, et cetera. And then secondly, food is going to be less cyclical. And then thirdly, as they add subscribers, those subscribers generally are more frequent users of the app, especially as they add new categories like groceries and convenience stores, which are really gaining scale now. Door to Door to Door is certainly unique in that they've largely been focused on deliveries. When you look at their competitor, for example, like Uber, they've obviously got the right hailing side, the food side, to your point, we've seen Door Dash diversify their offerings. But when you look at those two names side by side, who do you think is better position to write out some of these economic headwinds? That's a really interesting question. I think at this point, given how strong the travel backdrop is, especially in the U.S., that Uber would be the preferred play overall. It's not to say that Door Dash in and of itself doesn't have a viable business model that's going to be successful over the long term. But if you're trying to balance risk and reward, Uber is actually priced at a more attractive valuation, we think, and offers you that hedge with the travel component, which is very strong right now. Finally, when you look at where you are with the stock, you've got a equal weight rating on the stock. What would it take for you, or what would you need to see to change that? So what we tried to express in our report this morning is that there's been some incremental changes in terms of how we understand the business and how they're expressing what's going on with the business to investors. Most importantly, on the incremental profits that are dropping down, you can get a better feel for some of these investments turning to scale. That does lead you to believe that EBITDA growth can be stronger next year. I think we need to see a little bit more performance relative to the current macro into the end of the year. I think what they printed yesterday and what they got it to is definitely going to put a firm floor on the stock. It's probably going to be volatile for a while, and then we'll evaluate it going forward. But we were definitely intrigued by what we saw off of that print. It certainly looks like you're not the only one if you look at the stock creation today. Stephen Fox, Fox Advisors, Fever CEO, get to have you on. Thank you. Well, take a look at shares of Coinbase.

Well, coming up the US added 261,000 jobs in October, we're going to do a deeper dive into two of the sectors where we saw significant growth that's coming up after this break. Employment and leisure and hospitality continue to trend up in October, with 35,000 jobs added for the month, although the sector as a whole is still 6.5% below its February 2020 level. Joining me now to discuss trends in the sectors, Nicholas, Lillio, Cesar CEO of NALSTDA, comprehensive workforce management platform. Nicholas, good to talk to you today. Let's start by talking about how exactly you are sort of at this intersection here. You've got pretty good visibility on the hiring in this specific space, but how's your software support all that? Yeah, great. Thanks for having me here. I'm excited to tell you about what we do. So at a high level, we're an operating system for hourly gig and flex workforces. As we all know, there's been immense challenges that these workforces are currently facing. What our platform does is help employers find workers, and it also helps them manage them. We're really oriented around helping employers transform into flex and dynamic workforces, moving away from the traditional 40-hour work week and allowing them to better access different pools of labor. We have a platform called FlexPool that aggregates a bunch of labor sources in a particular area, and essentially gives employers access to logistics and other opportunities to engage with this workforce so they can ensure that they're fully staffed. So it's kind of what we do. So what's the data that you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,30,2022-11-04 15:47:29
4843," opportunities to engage with this workforce so they can ensure that they're fully staffed. So, it's kind of what we do. So, what is the data that you have there through your platform? What does that tell you about how many workers are looking for a little more flexibility, but more importantly, how competitive the pay is for those who are looking for those types of jobs? Yeah, absolutely. So, workers are looking for flexibility. I think employers have been slow to embrace the idea that flexible work is here to stay. And they're struggling to find workers who are willing to work 40-50 hours a week. Workers want to be able to choose when they work. They might want to work 15 hours this week, 20 hours the following week. And they have to adapt to the fact that workers have preferences that don't necessarily align with what employers want. So, what we've been really oriented around is helping them better access pools of labor that allow them to work with these types of workers. We give them tools to help them schedule. We allow them to better and more easily track these workers. So, there's a fundamental change in the labor market and employers are just struggling to find people. It's very challenging out there. And we're showing on the screen there some of the top cities that are most attractive for flex workers right now, New York, Atlanta, LA, Denver, and Dallas. You know, we have seen employers increasingly turn to a little more flexible work schedule, largely because of need. What are you hearing from them about their ability to fill these job posts once they add a little more leeway into the scheduling? Yeah, so they're seeing huge increases in their ability to fill jobs when they adopt flex. They're realizing that workers are more productive, they're happier, they're more able to work when they can choose the terms on which they work. And so employers that have embraced it have seen tremendous results with that. Now, it doesn't mean that employers aren't facing challenges with the increased complexity with flex work. But on the whole, the employers who adopt flex work are seeing much higher fill rates than employers who have not. And where are some of the biggest employers utilizing your software? So, we work with dozens of pro sports teams, most of the major hotel and hospitality brands like Marriott, Milwaukee Brewer's, those types of entities. We also work with Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 big box retailers, warehouses, distribution centers, those types of entities. Now, Cecio, Nicholas, Lillios, joining us in our New York video. Good to have you on today. Thank you. Well, employment and healthcare rose by 53,000 in the month of October. That is 13 consecutive months of additions for the sector. The industry has been hiring at a rapid pace this year, about 47,000 jobs a month this year versus the 9,000 back in 2021. Angeloi Kamlani here to look at a kind of an interesting angle in this space. Angeloi, I know you've been looking at where these job postings are and you found an interesting trend. I did. Actually, it started off with sort of an anecdotal hearing about a rise in chief medical officers at corporate America, and especially during the pandemic. And so I started looking into that. And what I found was really interesting. Not only did we see sort of a shift in what was happening. So you mentioned that those gains in the past year, but let's turn the clock back a little bit. What we saw was actually a drop in the number of healthcare jobs and those with medical training for the entire year of 2021, or reporting to at least 300,000 lost jobs in that year alone. Meanwhile, of course, we've seen the gains since then and in the past year, but chief medical officers that saw a spike during the pandemic. So start off with 2019, just 767 job postings. Meanwhile, going to 2020 30, 400, 2021 more than 5,000 and now in 2022 to date nearly 3000 alone. So that just tells you the story of sort of where this mass exodus is of these medically trained individuals and especially doctors getting opportunities in health tech and startups in corporate America at senior level positions to really help guide companies who are now starting to re-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,31,2022-11-04 15:51:38
4844," Getting opportunities in health tech and startups in corporate America at senior level positions to really help guide companies who are now starting to realize the importance of having a trained physician or a trained clinician on board to not just keep their employees healthy, but also in the event of another pandemic, which we know experts are wary about and been warning about, to have someone in-house who they can consult in a time of need. Yeah, you know, that was kind of my question, Angelina, and it makes sense in something like health tech to have a chief medical officer when you're talking sort of traditional corporate America. I mean, what does that job entail, number one, but what is the incentive for these companies who are not necessarily in health care to be hiring for this? Well, like I said, the pandemic is one thing, but really beyond that, we know that health care is one of the most costliest expenses for companies, right? Sales for CMO, Githin, Iar told me that it's the most expensive cost on the balance sheet for companies. So, having that to look at, it means that companies really need to look at a way to not only drop costs, but also address some of the issues. Having a clinician can advise on preventative measures, on preventative services, on mental health as well. So, all of that is coming together now with all of these companies that you can see on your screen. These are the ones that have either had chief medical officers or brought one on board during the pandemic in order to respond to the pandemic. And all of these officers told me there's definitely room for growth in this area. Yeah, it certainly makes sense when you consider just, um, health-up, but a lot of these companies were caught, less food during the pandemic. I actually think so much for that. Well, coming up those looking for a job in New York City, I'm now going to know something job seekers in other cities don't. How much that job pays. We're going to tell you more about it after the break. Well, this week in New York City, all job listings must now include salary range. That's according to the New York City Commission on Human Rights. The salary listings must have a maximum and a minimum and will be based on good faith of the employer. For more on this, let's bring in Yahoo Finance, the Danny Romero on how New York City employers are starting to comply. You know, there's a lot of employees that I know are curious about what the range is for similar jobs, but how quickly has compliance come up to date and what are the some of the challenges that employers are facing?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,32,2022-11-04 15:56:06
4845," that I know are curious about what the range is for similar jobs, but how quickly has compliance come up to date and what are the some of the challenges that employers are facing? Look, Akiko, I mean, I feel like what we're seeing is that employers are really testing the limits with this new transparency law here in New York City that requires posting those salary ranges. I mean, some employers even posted very broad salary ranges that the difference is over $100,000 for this one position. So it's leaving applicants confused when they are looking into these job postings, but the law requires that all companies with four or more employees to produce a good faith salary range, something that the employers are willing to pay for that candidate, and it's expected to benefit four million private sector workers and employers will get a 30-day warning to correct any violations before facing fines. So we did seek some companies jump on this bandwagon and comply before the rollout of this law, Bank of America was one of them, JP Morgan City Group Comcast, that's just to name a few, Akiko. And other states like Colorado have started to roll out this pay transparency law as well. What does that mean for the broader labor market? I mean, does that give employees a little more leverage, let's say, because of the transparency? I mean, I feel like we could see this pay transparency law really roll out across the nation. I mean, California is the next one up and they're expected to roll out their pay transparency law next year in January. So if we consider the states that have rolled out so far, which include Colorado, New York, and soon to be California, I mean, it could impact one in six workers that is according to pay scale. So considering these laws, I mean, these laws really aim to close the gap and racial pay gap. And those gaps are larger for women. I mean, women make 83 cents for for every dollar, men earn. And for women of color, the gap is even wider. So there has been some backlash, Akiko from some of these Wall Street banks that say that it forces them to disclose too much to their rivals. But on the flip side, Akiko, this really touches upon the fact that maybe we're talking maybe talking about your salary or even being transparent about it is no longer taboo. I mean, we can see on TikTok, some of these Gen Zers make reels asking people what's your job? How much do you make? So we're really seeing a change in demographics right now. Okay, a bit of a shift in the labor market there. Danny Romero, thanks so much for that. That doesn't for me in this 11 o'clock hour. We obviously were going to be covering and continue to cover the market reaction to that jobs report today.

4846," Here is the Caution of a After the snack brand reported, it's 11th straight quarter of over 9% revenue growth and said higher prices count to 420% of the rise. Hostess Brandt, CEO, Annie Callan joins us now to discuss and you always nice to see here. We're sure getting some pretty good reads on consumers back out there traveling and moving around. What are you seeing in your brand within convenience stores? Yeah, well, you know, the breath of our portfolio is pretty wide across all channels. We do see a lot of resiliency. You know, we have an on the go or high impulse category. Consumers are back traveling. We're in two spaces, both with macro trends and tailwinds behind us for our split vacates. And one of them is indulgent and permissible snacking of which our portfolio and Twinkie fits the bill. Convenience is very resilient. Consumers are still traveling and they're going through whether it's around the home more. When they're in the round the home more, they're traveling around the home more. That's good for our business and when they're driving more, that's good for our business. So we're really seeing a lot of resiliency, including in our convenience channel, which point of sale grew above 13% this last quarter. And I'm also curious, Andy H. Julie here, which categories, which subcategories are doing the best right now? What's sort of the hottest product out there? Well, our core icons always do well. We're pre-packed. Most of our portfolio is prepared for snacking and our two iconic brands or iconic brand hostess with all of its subbrands as well as our boardman portfolio, which is a little bit more than 10% of portfolio are both performing well. By the way, boardman point of sale was up 28.8%. So we see indulgent snacking on total, a really continuing half trailwinds. That's been before the pandemic and that's now today. And we really have a pure play snacking portfolio. So we're well positioned to capitalize on that growth with the assets to achieve that growth. We see morning breakfast continuing to grow. That's a $5.8 billion segment. We recently launched Bound Show that really attacks the lunch box occasion at $6.2 billion in total consumer occasions. So this indulgent snacking is really moving across the board in the faces of we compete. Our boardman portfolio, by the way, is the number one share within sugar free for cookies and $8 billion total category, but it's growing and more than twice a rate of total cookies. So we were really positioned well for macro consumer trends. Andy, you've put up several good quarters in a row now. What is it about a twinkie or the other products that you're selling? There are other snacks out there. Had you survey folks on why they're gravitating to your brands? Well, there's a couple of things. First of all, even during times of recession or when times are good, consumers reach for permissible and indulgent snacks that they feel are at an accessible price point. We're maniacal and making sure we provide the right value to our consumers when they have. The other thing that we really spend a lot of time over the last three or four years is focusing on our product quality. So when consumers come and they want an indulgent snack, they want it to be a good reward. They don't need a lot, but they need it in a portion controlled form. We've invested in product quality, our penetration and households is going up. But also, we're accessing and adding two times buyer to our category, to our franchise, to our host's business, as greater than twice the rate of the rest of the category. That means when consumers come and try us, they'd like it and they're coming and repeating. So we're doing all of the fundamentals at right. I don't top of that are increasing advertising to build the gap between our aided awareness and top of mind awareness and our innovation. And you get a recipe for 11 straight quarters above 9 percent growth. Andy, you talked about holding the line on value at the same time you did take price, right? So, you també進 already. Now when you did a speech for your public comment on the title, that city offer,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,34,2022-11-04 16:04:52
4847," and our innovation and you get a recipe for 11 straight quarters above 9% growth. Andy, you talked about holding the line on value at the same time you did take price, right? Because that's one of the things, or the main thing that was responsible for the revenue bump here. So how do you calculate that A and B, what happens to price now going forward? Are you going to keep on raising? As we sit here today, what we see, especially as we close out the years to, we're only talking about 23, we have the pricing in the marketplace to obviously deliver our raised guidance. We raised our revenue and top and bottom line guidance for the full year of FY22. This is the way we look at it. We take the value that we deliver to consumers very serious. And then we also have a suite of tools that we love. We utilize to leverage the efficiency of which we deliver them. We balance both of those. So in the quarter despite having a 20% pricing that move through the consumer, our gross margin still contracted a little less than 100 basis points. We believe over time given our revenue growth management initiatives, our productivity initiatives. And when needed, when we get this high of inflation, it was above 18% in the quarter, as a last resort, we do move the pricing. So that's why pricing's in the marketplace now. We think we have the right balance going forward, but given our agility and our continued focus on the fundamentals, if needed, we're in a position to do that. We don't believe we are today. We do, we are committed to, by the way, of recovering our gross margins over time. And as a reminder, our growth algorithm is to a mid single digit top line growth at five to seven percent EBITDA growth and seven and nine percent EPS growth. We believe we'll continue, even from this point forward, despite our incredible performance of the last three years, lead to top tier shareholder return. Andy, real quick, before I let you go, what is your one big product that you're going to launch next year? Anything you could take us inside the C-suite? Well, we're in the process right now of launching our bouncer. So bouncer's is our focus. It targets a lunchbox occasion. It reimagines some of our icons like Twinkies and DingDons and Donets. It puts it in a poppable form, a two-by-poppable form. And it's perfect for the lunchbox or any carried occasion. Retailer acceptance has been extremely positive. We're very proud of it. We're ramping up the consumer advertising here as we move it to Q4. We're very enthusiastic. Obviously consumers will tell, but we're obviously very positive about that. We have a great track record of innovation that we've built over the last several years. Bouncer's. All right. Hostess Francio and E. Calahan. Thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Well, homework helper. Che, they aced their third quarter and boosted its full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,35,2022-11-04 16:08:56
4848," Well homework, helper, Cheg, they aced their third quarter and boosted its full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA as college enrollment begins to stabilize here a little bit more. Cheg's chief financial officer, Andy Brown joins us now. Andy, thanks so much for taking the time and helping us run through the quarter. If you got to think of one catalyst that really sticks out to you within the business from this past period, what is that? Yeah, it's been an interesting 12 months for Cheg and as you had mentioned, things what we're seeing in the headwinds that we saw maybe a year ago have now stabilized. As far as catalyst with respect to Cheg, I mean one of the things that we have been doing is pushing what I'll call offering our premium price option. We call the Cheg Study Pack and we continue to see a great momentum there adding more value to the study pack and more of our students are taking that premium price option and that's had a very nice impact on not just our revenue growth but our earnings and as you saw in our report, we blew through our earnings and we raised our guidance quite significantly. When we think of the past two years, it's really changed the way that a lot of colleges, universities might think about where people can be educated from, how they can be educated, what type of opportunities that create for Cheg even in a Renaissance moment for education or a new normal that we're heading towards? Well, when we came to Cheg, our CEO came 13, 14 years ago, I'm now in my 13th year here, we were a textbook renter but our vision was always that we would offer many types of services online and we used to use the term and continue to use the term that you bet on the inevitable and the inevitable is that more and more things are going to be done online. And so we embarked upon offering subscription services, homework help services that were exactly how students wanted and that is their relatively inexpensive, their online, they're available 24 by 7 and those are the types of services that students expect and we continue to deliver whereas the traditional college experience was all of the help was on campus but that's not the modern student today. I mean, I think a lot of people don't realize is that you may think of a traditional four-year residential school but many students in today's environment are actually part-time students that are commuting into community colleges, they don't have the ability to get help at the institution and so we provide that opportunity to learn anywhere, anytime, any place. And Andy, you guys are also expanding more into things that have nothing to do with traditional students that is college students, right? You're looking more to the corporate world as well. I know you have a partnership that allows companies to give their employees language learning. How big a part of your business is that and how much are you looking to that business for growth? Yeah, so you're talking about our skills platform and we believe for a long period of time that, you know, while most of what we do today or have historically has been academic and we believe skills-based learning will play a much larger role, is playing a much larger role and will continue to play a larger role in the future. So to your point, we have several skills products. One is what we call our thinkful line of services and then more recently language learning with BUSU and we do work with a company called Guild, that then delivers those services to large corporations like Chipotle and Wal-Mart and so forth. And more recently, what we announced on our earnings call that we were going to be including our language skills services through Guild starting in 2023. So we do believe, you know, when you imagine, check, I'll call it two to three years or now, skills will be a much bigger part of our revenue and contribution. And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw feedback from the local wodshef and you could support hiring the user.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,36,2022-11-04 16:13:28
4849," And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw an adjusted EBITDA in the positive. Where is that coming from? How are you guys achieving that? And what are some of your targets on that front? Yeah, so we've always focused on profitable growth. That's always something that we've talked about at our company and as you can see, we continue to do that. We had a nice beat in Q4. But inherently in our model because we've got a fairly fixed content cost and much of our uses come through unpaid sources. It's just natural that as we scale, our margins will scale. And I'll just remind everybody, I mean, we're profitable across every line. It's not just EBITDA, it's not just non-GAP. We're GAP profitable. So we do believe that we'll continue. We're not going to put a cap on where that would be. We're not at a steady state profitability yet. We do believe that as we scale, we will continue to increase our margins. And while we have you, this has been a significant year, perhaps the most significant that I can remember in terms of student loan debt relief and kind of the conversation to advance the cost of college and reforming the high expenses that families and individuals incur. Just from the Cheg Lens, you can give us your read through moving forward from here, where some of these costs can start coming down, given that Cheg was one of those platforms that ultimately can reduce the costs on the book front that were so extensive for a lot of college goers and education seekers. Yeah, so it is painful. And I think this is more of a, it pains me to see college students going to college taking on large debt, but then are unavailable to actually pay it off. And that's what you're seeing. So does that disconnect on the ROI? In many cases, not all cases, but in many cases, the ROI. And I think that is a big part of what as a society we need to fix. What is the ROI of going to college so we don't get into these situations where students fundamentally can't pay that debt off, which is real simple. There isn't an R, there wasn't an ROI on that particular student's education. So I think that's the fix that we need to do. And that still hasn't been accomplished. Andy Brown, thanks so much for being here. Thanks, Cheg's Chief Financial Officer. Checking in on the King.

4851," add dollar menus or kind of entry level ala cart menus. I don't know if dollar is any longer the relevant price point but having an everyday entry level price point product that consumers can go to ala cart and or to bundle I think is an important aspect of being a broad based and very thoughtful restaurant business and that's something that we continue to explore. Look at our teams are working on quality and product offerings at the right price that allow for customers to come in more frequently and enjoy our brands day in and day out. There's two and a half percent net restaurant growth when you think about the franchisees what are you hearing from franchisees right now and even potential franchisees in different markets and how they're potentially looking to get into business with restaurant brands. Yeah we have a lot of excitement around growth in our business and fundamentally restaurant brands and our four amazing iconic brands are growth brands and growth businesses. We've got a lot of room for growth internationally for all four of our brands even Burger King that has north of 12,000 restaurants in international markets. We've got a lot of room for growth we think domestically with firehouse with Popeyes Tim's in the US is beginning to to rev up their engines from a from a growth standpoint and obviously firehouse has a huge runway domestically as well. franchisees are excited they're obviously concerned in near term with the impacts that we're seeing in inflation commodity costs that that's all that translates not only to food costs but also to construction costs. There's there's always a challenge around getting permitting and the process of getting approvals to move forward with new restaurants sites but we have a healthy pipeline we have a lot of interest from existing franchisees as well as new franchisees to develop our brands domestically and internationally and we continue to work with our partners to to move those pipelines along and and continue to grow our businesses and over time we think we're going to we're on our way to our 40,000 restaurant goal with restaurant brands over the next several years. I have 10 seconds left and this is national sandwich day. Somebody's been up in town they've been out there touting their sales gains any any smack talk form. Look our brands are awesome we have firehouse burger king Tim's and Popeyes I think they're the best in each of their categories in burger chicken coffee and and sandwich and I'll let the customers decide who the best brands are. My focus is building a great team working with our franchisees and delivering profitable opportunities for growth across the across our four brands. You're too nice Jose you're too nice. Just too nice. I was there as a customer of Popeyes I can say on this sandwich day that that chicken sandwich is family. Thank you so much for joining us here on the show.

4852," you I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the second question. I'm going to start with the second question. BlueBin are shares or seeing a pop after topping estimate in his latest quarter that stock up nearly 5%. The global automotive technology company reporting revenue of nearly 30% higher from the previous quarter and up 60% year on year. BlueBin are maintaining its full year guidance as it remains on practical chief. 2022 milestones for more on all this we have Lumen R CEO Austin Russell joining us today Austin it's good to talk to you. I'm going to get through the numbers in a bit but I want to point to an announcement that someone argue kind of overshadowed this wrong core that you had. Lumen R's lighter equipment and software now shipping on cars and then you have to do positive movements at a time where there's concerns about where self driving is going. Talk to me about how that's progressing and what that tells you about the timeline for wider adoption. Yeah, no, I think the whole point of what we've done is that really after 10 years of you know innovating, point of type being developing industrialized. I think we're finally making this journey. We're actually making its way out of that whole moonshot R&D phase into production vehicles and it's something that we couldn't be more excited about. But yeah, it's happening. It's coming together. And of course, psych, you know, is the largest Chinese automaker with their they have a new fully electric brand. You know, rising auto with the R7 that we're launching on but that's just the start. Or I showed the one to that on November 9th. And then we also just had pole star. They just introduced the pole star three a couple of weeks ago. Also featuring a woman or so all this is converging and this is just the start, you know, then you don't were say to use a Nissan and other partners that we have. Fantastic. Let's talk about the numbers in the quarter, especially with the cash on hand. You ended the quarter of the year. And then we have a $150 to $200 million a year. It certainly looks like you are on track to reach profitability. Talk to me about the timeline you're looking at right now for the company. So while we're going to be hosting actually a luminar day, you know, come the first quarter of next year. We're going to outline all the details with the guards to our timeline and plans associated with becoming cash flow positive. But I think the key point is that we're going to have a little bit of a little positivity with a strong buffer as well for everything that we want to do for our four business and beyond. So that's that's really good. But and fortunately in a very privileged position when it comes to capital needs and there's huge upfront capital requirements as well that's needed to make this happen in addition to, of course, the technology to people, the resources and partnerships. And so we're generating real business and revenue. This is the first time that this kind of tech is making its way into a series production for these kinds of, you know, next generation safety and autonomous capabilities and having that revenue ultimately is able to be very helpful towards building a viable business. Whereas, you know, the vast majority of autonomous legal related companies are either have a pre revenue or little to no revenue for the foreseeable future. So that's a fundamental thing to be able to make happen in the growth curve with the automakers. And finally, Austin, you pointed to some of the positive steps you're taking in the partnership that you have with car makers, but, you know, we have had some setback in the autonomous trading.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,40,2022-11-04 16:30:46
4853," to some of the positive steps you're taking in the partnership that you have with car makers, but you know we have had some setback in the autonomous driving push. We had Ford and Volkswagen most recently pulling the plug essentially on their self-driving ambitions and I wonder where you think things are headed. I mean was this kind of shakedown inevitable given the technology that needed to get to full autonomous driving and it's sort of the grand vision that was set out years ago in terms of where this is headed. Is that still intact? Um well one the grand vision that I think many gave in the industry is absolutely not intact. But the key distinction here is that that's a completely different world than the kind of stuff that we're doing here at Luminor. The main issue with what we've seen from a broader autonomous vehicle standpoint is that both the vast majority of companies have really been focused around eliminating the driver with all-out robotaxies in urban environments. So the big bet that we made was actually not that at all. It was actually for consumer production vehicles in trucks as well. As an opportunity to be able to improve the safety of the vehicle enhance the driver, not replace the driver altogether. And that's a key distinction here of how this is happening and the rest of it is actually I mean for what it's worth it's not any different than what I was saying a handful of years ago. I think people may just listen more now. But the reality is that that's a 10-year journey. That's a long time frame here too. What we're doing is already starting to make its way into production cars today. It takes years worth of work and advance and a lead-up of what we've had to do to make it happen. But because of the fact that we're focused on safety, we're focused on much more constrained problems here. Getting rid of that you know $100,000 roof rack full of sensors and a supercomputer in the trunk and now having something that can go on to production vehicles as a cleanly integrated system. That's what we think is incredibly powerful and that's why we're seeing all this adoption by all these major automakers. And I think as the industry evolves we're only missing more and more people pivot towards that strategy which ultimately ends up you know just as with that argo case ends up being more synergistic with the stuff that we're doing. Yeah it's certainly been great to track all the progress with Lumenar. Austin Russell, Lumenar CEO appreciate your time today. Thanks so much for joining us. All right we're joining us now for another perspective on the housing market is Bruce McNeilidge. Kimlock Partners co-founder and CEO Bruce thank you for joining us this afternoon. As we're seeing though even though the Fed good to have you even though the Fed raising rates we're seeing the 10-year yield ticking up mortgage that mortgage rates over the 30-year fixed ticking below 7%. Help us understand the correlations here. Sure so the 10-year treasury doesn't necessarily affect the payments of commercial debt and what builders are paying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,41,2022-11-04 16:35:02
4854," Sure, so the 10 year treasury doesn't necessarily affect the payments of commercial debt and what builders are paying, but certainly it's going to affect interest rates for the average person. And right now, actually, the rates as of yesterday were right around 7 and a quarter, and that really hurts the entry level home buyer significantly because they barely can afford a house right now with the cost of housing going up because of supply chain and materials. And as that house goes up in place, it's knocking more and more buyers out of having the ability to purchase a home and they either have to rent a home or stay in the home that they're currently in. Bruce, just what's your assessment on the damage that the Fed has caused in the housing market? And I guess any concern that the Fed is doing too much with what it sounds like more rate hikes on the table? Sure, so it's really going to be a trickle down position where people are not going to be able to buy houses. It's going to hurt mortgage brokers. It's going to hurt bankers. It's going to hurt realtors really hurt people. And I think what what the situation was people were not ready for this. It turned on a dime and really changed significantly more quicker than most people would have expected. So builders are still building houses, but they can't they can't sell houses and that's really putting builders in a position where they have to discount houses. And with the Fed raising things as again as quick as they they have done it's hurting folks in the residential real estate business significantly. And it's going to take them many months if not a year or two to catch up because of what they've done at the Federal Reserve. So then Bruce, this supply and demand balance that the Fed is looking for. How far out do you see that being? So what it's going to do is it's going to not develop as fact because if if banks aren't loaning money to developers or developers are skittish on developing land, that's going to put builders back several years because you have to develop a land before you build the houses. And so during this time builders can't get commercial loans or interest rates are going up for those loans. Same thing with developers, there are problems getting loans. And that's basically going to end up again a year or two, three years in the future. It's going to have a ripple effect because it's going to cost folks money and it's also going to cost folks a lot a lot of time because they have to catch up because of the slowdown in the economy that the Fed is creating. Bruce, we spoke to you about a month ago. You told us that traffic had been falling off just in terms of demand out there. We saw a little bit of relief. I guess it mortgage rates this morning, although not too far below that 7% number there has demand declined even further over the last couple of weeks from your perspective. I'm actually in one of my new houses we just bought from a builder right now and demand has not wane. The demand is still there. The entry level home buyer, the millennial they want to own house. The problem is the houses are without a reach. They might have been saving and looking at paying a three or four percent interest rate and budgeting for that. But now that the rates are up to 7%, it really forces those people that were working hard and saving for a house. It really knocks them out of the market and it's making tougher for all people to afford a house. And unfortunately that has a ripple effect. So then in terms of inventory, obviously people holding on to the good mortgage rates they got before the Fed started raising interest rates. What is this doing for first time home buyers? What sort of options do they actually have right now? Well, if you can qualify for a mortgage, builders are discounted houses significantly. I've seen 10% 15% even 20% discounts to retail pricing for the entry level home buyer to come in, take a look at houses and able to close on houses. The problem is they just can't afford houses and there are too many houses on the ground. So what builders really need right now is more buyers that can qualify for mortgages. The buyers are out there, the demands out there, but just qualifying for mortgage and then affording that higher payment is really a hurdle for the entry level home buyer. Bruce, you mentioned 10, 15, 20% discounts on the table right now. Can we see larger discounts if demand if traffic doesn't pick up here? Well, I think it could be a discount in the form of number of things. They can give you different features in the house, free refrigerator, ceiling fans, credit for furniture, closing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,42,2022-11-04 16:39:20
4855," Well, I think it could be a discount in the form of number of things. They can give you different features in the house, free refrigerator, ceiling fans, credit for furniture, closing costs, credits to get a mortgage and pay the points. And so I think, again, it's a supply and demand thing. We were in the deep south. We were traveling through Atlanta. And one builder has 150 houses on the ground finished that they have no offers on. 150 houses and that's one builder. Imagine a dozen builders. So really the builders are going to have to keep reducing their prices until the supply and demand takes care of their inventory. And then they can certainly level off those prices. But that's going to be a big hit to the bottom line of builders. But again, something's got to give. There's too many houses built and not enough buyers right now that can qualify for mortgages. Yeah, Bruce, I know that you're focused on the southeast region right now. Is this more of a regional story or is this scenario playing out across the country? No, this is a national story. There are just not enough homes for people that want homes. The millennials are now in their 30s. They're looking to start homes and their subdivisions. They're moving out of the urban core and having children. So the demand is there. The problem is, give an example, people save in 401k right now. 401k have become 301k's. So people certainly don't have the money, whether it's in savings, whether it's the stock market going down and retirement plans that they can borrow from. The money's just not there. The demand is there. And that's across the country. Now the southeast and the southwest are certainly areas that have had much higher growth and much higher demand over the years. But it's a it's a problem nationwide. And Bruce, I want to ask you about some of the layoffs that we've seen with Open Door, with Zillow as well. What are your expectations that we know that obviously that we're far from where we were at the peak of the pandemic when the everyone was sort of clawing for houses right now? What are your expectations for layoffs in the retail industry here? So those I buyers will certainly be cutting back. If they don't have enough houses to buy and sell, that certainly is going to lead to layoffs and reduced income for the I buyers. But this can be a trickle down effect. You're talking about real estate agents. All sorts of different companies are going to be laying off people banks, people that do mortgages, process mortgages, cell houses, realtors. They all are going to be squeezed by this. And I think you're going to see a shake out across all the different industries that make up the financial positions that have to all line up for someone to afford house banks are going to be lending less money. And there's going to be a lot of shake out in the banking industry. Certainly a challenging time. All right. Bruce McNeilidge, Kinlock Partners co-founder and CEO. Thanks so much. 30,000 pilots from the nation's largest airlines rejecting contracts this week. Negotiations derailed by the pandemic now growing tens as the industry contends with a pilot shortage of mid escalating costs for more we want to bring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,43,2022-11-04 16:43:47
4856," And rejecting contracts this week negotiations derailed by the pandemic now growing tense as the industry contends with a pilot shortage amid escalating costs. For more, we want to bring in Captain Dennis Tejer, allied pilots association spokesperson. And this union represents 15,000 American Airlines pilots. Dennis, it's great to have you. So let's start with American Airlinesers. And you are representing the 15,000 pilots of that carrier voted against the tentative agreement this week. Why? Well, our leadership actually took what was in place and reviewed it and said it didn't get anywhere near meeting what our membership expect for a contract. And it's not just about the money. There's a market rate for pilots. It's gone up dramatically. Inflation has cut away at our purchasing power. We watch Alaska national carrier versus us as a global carrier, just settle a deal. And importantly, they went up 20 plus percent on their pay rates. But the number one issue for our pilots is work life balance and scheduling practices and the Alaska pilots work with their management team to execute a deal that will not only take care of that need for the pilots, but actually freeze them up to do even more flying and keeps the schedule more reliable. You know, on this program on a financial side, you know what an airline cancels flights. It affects the unit costs because it's less ASM seat available seat miles out there. Right now, American by having all these canceled flights is actually increasing their costs and they haven't even gotten a value out of it if they had actually invested in a pilot contract. So we're going to get this done, but it's not going to be done on the cheap. It's not going to be done with a low level investment because the revenue opportunity out there is unlike anything we've ever seen. Just listen to the quarterly calls every CO saying record revenue and passenger demand like they've never seen before even in the so called shoulder months. So then how many of these issues were already brewing before COVID really put a lot more pressure on pilots and an airline workers as well versus some of the more specific things that are now coming out. So great question. These some of these issues were Fisher cracks within the foundation of operation through management's in attention to that, but the pandemic when they did not keep pilots trained they retired airplanes early and didn't retrain pilots for that. That furloughed pilots had early returbs. I think I might have mentioned that bottom line was they had this wave of pilot training that they never did, which is part of the $54 billion investment promise. That part they're still catching up from so what they've done is they saw the revenue coming in the demand they didn't expect that to come back till 2024. Well, they were an outlier because we saw it coming along with many analysts. So what happened is now they just dumped in ticket sales even Delta admitted they just went for the revenue and they overplayed it. So now they have a system that is not trusted that has been pushed to the edge and the things that they did to try and keep it rolling they continue to try and do that. They schedule us to the maximum with very little buffer and we go illegal flight cancels where they pushes to the point of exhaustion where by FAA law, we cannot fly when we're fatigued and we have to make the right call for safety and actually fatigue off of a flight. These are all undermining the reliability and the revenue stream not to mention the brand damage and it's also pushing on a margin of safety. We're going to defend that margin of safety so no passenger has to worry about that, but we're human and the first thing that goes when you fatigue is your judgment. It's a vicious cycle and it's got to be stopped and some of the answers are in our contract. I can guarantee you that working with us is going to be a lot less expensive than if you work against us because there's revenue to go get out there and we want to help you harvest that. As you said, it's not just about the money in the latest tentative agreement. It did call for 12% raises for pilots on the date of the contract signing plus 5% after 1 year, 2% after 2 years. Were you satisfied with that part of it or do you want a bigger pay increase? Well, that did not satisfy at all. Number one, we got influxible. What would satisfy us is actually recognizing that the entire regional affiliates are smaller airplanes. They got pay raises up into the 80% range. As we're looking for, we know they're deeply behind. You can get paid more working for regional affiliate, the smaller airplanes and you can for mainline. So upside down, we're going to fix.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,44,2022-11-04 16:48:04
4857," 80% range. And that's not what we're looking for. We know they're deeply behind. You can get paid more working for a regional affiliate, the smaller airplanes, and you can for main line. It's upside down. We're going to fix that. The other side of this is that every contract is up for negotiations now. Son Zalaska, who settled, you're not going to be left behind. Do your management team. You're not going to be the outlier. And I got news for you, we will have snapups because we're all negotiating in this narrow band of time. If someone gets a little bit higher pay rate, you're not going to be an outlier by providing that because we are going to have a snapup that brings us there. It's becoming the industry standard. And all this the convergence of the pandemic, the recovery and these contract negotiations make it a very safe and compelling time to negotiate modern deals with pilots. It's going to be a commoditized not only on a pay rate basis, but actual utilization rate. It's all right here, and it's actually going to be good for the industry. We just have to get management to join us so that we can point all of our energy toward making a better product, put more flights out there, which will actually help ease the unit costs. The more ASMG have out there, we get this business and we want to be a part of it in a functional way, but we will not be exploited while management tries to figure out how to modernize their operation. We'll certainly be keeping track of how talks are progressing a big thank you allied pilots association spokesperson Captain Dennis Tager. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, shares of Starbucks trading higher off reporting those fourth quarter earnings there up almost 3% where British securities managing director Nick Setchen joins us to help break those numbers down. Good to have you back, Nick. Now, we know you had a neutral rating on the stock and a price target of $92. What did you like in this earnings report? Well, the US comp is clearly on fire here, including positive transactions. So, you know, the company is able to pass on 10% you know, average check growth and still manage to get 1% positive transactions. That that that's clearly bucking the trying to earn the restaurant industry. And then on top of that, you know, despite the China was the rest of international X China is doing better as well. So the rest of the markets like Japan, South Korea are actually carrying China along, right? I mean, so the consensus estimate for international, including China was down eight came in down around six. So beat on international as well despite China headache. And Nick, that's interesting here because clearly the results are very strong. Once you take out the weakness that we are seeing out of China. But as we enter the next couple of months, which at least from now looks like it's going to be pretty choppy. We could see more of a significant slowdown here in the US where Starbucks clearly outperformed last quarter. What's your read on what we could see this current quarter and looking ahead into next year? Well, so I mean, I expect the guidance to be very positive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,45,2022-11-04 16:52:24
4858," What's your read on what we could see this current quarter and looking ahead into next year? Well, so I mean, I expect the guidance to be very positive, relative to expectations. The question is, despite the guidance, what actual results will look like as the year progresses, in the near term, at least through the first half of their fiscal year, so the holiday season and on fiscal Q1 ending in March or calendar Q1 ending in March, I expect them to continue to have high-singlisher comps in the US, even with negative transactions. So I see very little risk to current expectations around FY 23. And Nick, a lot of people are looking for some cues as to how the consumer is feeling about things. Doesn't seem to be the case though, for Starbucks, even same store sales growth, up 11% people also spending more higher foot traffic. Then what do you think consumers are driven to Starbucks, whereas we're seeing some other retailers really struggling? Well, you know, an interesting thing is restaurants across the board have been doing very well this quarter, not a single restaurant, with the exception of a couple of, you know, company-specific cases has missed so far, with about 85% of restaurants reporting. So every single restaurant, practically every single restaurant has beaten expectations and has given very solid guidance, especially around the top line. And that's being driven number one by an extraordinary price increase, we increase, but even with those big price increases, the gap versus growth rate is expanding. So growth rate prices are seeing higher year growth rates than the restaurants number one. So that's helping restaurants become a relative value as ironic as that sounds. And then two, we're still benefiting, restaurants are still benefiting from this. You know, I don't want to stay home, I want to go out and enjoy experiences as opposed to, you know, ordering goods online. And so restaurants continue to benefit from that tail as well. Nick, what about the price increases over the last 12 months? We've seen prices rise by about 5% do you think more in store? I think more in store, but I do think that because grocery starts, grocery prices are rising faster, restaurants are not in danger as much as, you know, first-plush might indicate. All right, always good to have you on Nick's set to live. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com collaborate on the emerging housing markets index, which considers battle and return on real estate investment, economic health and quality of life. And with the population just over 70,000 Johnson City Tennessee came out on top. Johnson City Mayor Joe Wise with us now on the economy and the housing market. Good to see you, Mr. Mayor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,46,2022-11-04 16:56:45
4859," Since city Tennessee came out on top, Johnson City mayor Joe Wise with us now on the economy and the housing market and good to see you Mr. Mayor and the obvious question is the wagon wheel song by Darius Rucker or number one on the Wall Street Journal emerging markets list. What was a bigger deal there in Johnson City? Well, we've had more time to think about the wagon wheel song, but we certainly find the both the exciting references, I suppose. Mayor, what do you attribute all this excitement to the fact that people are coming from all over the country? It sounds like having interest in your relatively small city. What's driving that? I think there are a number of factors that have contributed to it. We've as a city made a sustained investment in infrastructure and particularly the deployment of direct fiber to every residents and business in our community to provide 10 gig internet. So that makes it a place that people can work remotely in a time when people are contemplating working remotely. But then alongside of those things are quality of life considerations that were home to East Tennessee State University that offers doctoral programs and medicine pharmacy and nursing and physical therapy and many other allied and health science fields. And so with that comes the parallel medical community with a local children's hospital, a level one trauma center. And so folks can come to Johnson City and find in a relatively modest sized town the resources, the services and the quality of life features and amenities that you might associate with significantly larger cities than Johnson City. And Mary, we just had the average price, the median home price in your city up on the screen. Now, $379,000 that's up from $350,000 just three months ago, up significantly on a year over your basis. What do you make of the dynamics that's playing out in the housing market in your city? What we could potentially see to prices here in the coming quarters? Well, that's something we're mindful of every good news has some consequences that may not always be favorable. And so we're aware of the potential risk to affordability and potentially the concerns around the quality of life that might be changed if we had a significant influx. And so as a community and as a city, we're making very deliberate efforts to look at growth management and making sure that when when all the dust settles, the things that made Johnson City desirable as a place to live remain true of Johnson City for those who live here now and those who might live here in the future. How did the pandemic actually boost the economy boost the real estate of your town? Well, I think remote work, you know, we began the process of deploying the 10 gig internet through our local energy authority years ago before we knew there would be a pandemic in 2020. And so really we were readying a capacity for remote workers, particularly long before the culture had an inclination to really be pursuing it the way we've seen over the last several years. And once people returned to office, how do you make sure people stay and don't leave Johnson City? Well, I think part of that is proximity. We're at the crossroads of interstates 26 and 81. We are within about a days drive of virtually everybody in the eastern half of the United States. And so for a lot of professionals, a community like Johnson City provides them the best of both worlds, we're only a few hours from places like Charlotte or Nashville or Atlanta. And so if your job doesn't require you to physically be in a specific location Monday to Friday, which lots of people's jobs do not, this might just be the right fit. Based upon the video I'm seeing, sir, I have got to come visit Johnson City Tennessee Mayor Joe Wise. We'll be against that. We will come see it.

4860," who spread it, who are quote unquote super spreaders should be held liable for spreading distance disinformation whether it's about COVID or vaccines or about Sandy Hook. I think journalism is still a really noble profession. The problem is so much of journalism has seeped into commentary. I hope that I'll be seen as somebody you know who did what my father told me my entire life. Do your best and that's what I've done. Hello everyone I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to Influencers and welcome to our guest Katie Kourik a course former host of the Today Show CBS evening news co-founder of Katie Kourik Media and author of the book going there and my former colleague at Yahoo which we'll get to. I'm sure Katie welcome great to see you. Hi Andy great to be here thanks for having me. Of course. Why don't we start out before we talk about the book. I'm curious to know about Katie Kourik Media and what you're up to and what's that all about? Well I love sort of being the boss of me as our kids used to say Andy and about three and a half years ago my husband and I saw that the media landscape was changing dramatically. I actually noticed that over the past decade or so and instead of depending on you know people to give me a job I decided I wanted to be a job creator. I wanted to try my hand at being an entrepreneur and that I thought the brand that I had established over 30 to 40 years in media was as powerful as some of the bigger brands and would be enable me to really personalize the news and view it from my perspective. So we decided to be pan media. We have a newsletter that goes over goes out to well over half a million people with a very high engagement rate. We have a podcast. I'm going to be recruiting other talent to contribute and we already have done that. We have somebody who's our book editor. We have a very vibrant relationship with Bobby Brown also used to be at Yahoo and so we're really establishing a collective of voices and in the meantime I'm also developing documentaries. I have a couple of scripted projects in development. I was an executive producer of a series on Netflix called Unbelievable and I wanted to realize Andy is storytelling has changed dramatically. It's no longer siloed. You can and a dissentral mediation allows you to go direct to consumer just as brands are doing and we now have about 35 people working at the company and really what I'm trying to do we also have a shop that you know has picks of what we think are purpose driven brands and female founded by pop founded LGBTQ plus founded companies that we're supporting and really shining a light on. So it's been really exciting because you know it's hard working for a big lumbering bureaucratic organization at times and I find that I can be much more nimble and I can create content at the drop of the hat a drop of a hat or I can do longer profiles and series and really explore topics I'm interested in that I think are worthy of a listener or reader or viewer's attention. What do you think about TV news right now Katie and you know we're seeing the emergence of streaming services like CNN plus and what does that mean for the industry how would you describe it? Well I think it's just another way to provide interesting content to consumers. You know it'll be interesting to see if people are going to pay for those services when there is so much news.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,48,2022-11-04 17:05:21
4861," You know, it'll be interesting to see if people are going to pay for those services when there is so much news everywhere. I mean, I'm just inundated with with news 24 seven and a lot of it is really high quality. I was just reading a great piece this morning on Joe mansion and the rolling stone that someone brought my attention to. So I think it'll be an interesting experiment to see if people are going to want that content. Well, they want to see Chris Wallace doing interviews. I'm not sure maybe hardcore Chris Wallace fans will but it seems to me that there is so much news. It's so ubiquitous now that they're going to have to provide something that is really unique. And I think they're trying to do that with sort of the model of Anthony Bourdain, which, you know, was established on CNN many years ago with evil on Goria, you know, I just I just don't know at what point I guess is the content overload Andy, you know, is there just so much to choose from will the cream still rise through the top probably but will it be enough to sustain some of these newer business models. I'm not sure. Right, and then ubiquity is both the blessing and the curse from the consumer standpoint because there is so much out there, but then how do you choose. And so I'm sure you're asked this question Katie people asked me all the time, what do you look at what do you read and how do you decide what to look at when there is so much stuff. Well, you know, I do rely primarily on newsletters and on Apple news and, you know, I remember when I was at Yahoo with you Andy, I begged for them to let me start a newsletter that would basically go straight to people's inboxes and help kind of curate the things they needed to know. You know, they they weren't interested in that at Yahoo for a variety of reasons, which we can talk about later and sort of what Yahoo's ultimate business goals were at the time, but, you know, I read a lot of news letters. I try to read the economists I look at time magazine I read the New York Times, the Washington Post, I read various news letters from reporters from those outlets. I read the pointer institute Tom Jones does a media newsletter the Pew Center research center does kind of what's going on in media interested in kind of looking at trends I read the information by Jessica lesson. So I really try to get a good cross section of helpful and useful information and sometimes I just look at Apple news and see what's trending and if there are articles that I'm interested in. And I feel like I really get a good sense of what's going on in the world with the a malgum of sources that I turn to. you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,49,2022-11-04 17:09:36
4862," you you you you today want to with these m water, so important. And I think it, you know, you can't just wave a magic wand. It's, it, there's, there's so many factors, I think, contributing to this imbalance of power that have been entrenched in our society for decades, if not centuries. And so one of the things that I hope we can do is have honest conversations about this. I think that's so imperative. And if my book models that, then that's something I'm really pleased about. Because I think what happens is, you know, there's, there's, there's progress and then there's a backlash. There's progress and then there's a backlash. And I think having open and honest conversations and not, you know, canceling people because they say the wrong thing or not rejecting them out of hand because the way that they see things which and their products of their own environments is a really important component to leveling the playing field for everyone. You write a course about, we talked about Matt Lauer or I mentioned him, I should say in the problems, and let's moon this, are men in TV and entertainment worse than other businesses? Or is it just that they're more high profile? You know, it's hard for me to answer that question Andy because I haven't really been in other businesses. But having said that, I do think they're more high profile. I think there's probably a little more, you know, it's not exactly a low-key or low-profile industry. So I think probably the ego level, men in television in general and sort of media is probably feeds into or fed, excuse me, fed into certain behavior for many, many years. So I think that, you know, I think it was just sort of business as usual. It was sort of the status quo for this kind of behavior. I think it was not only tolerated, but in some cases encouraged in television news, and especially as women were entering.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,50,2022-11-04 17:13:55
4863," not only tolerated, but in some cases encouraged in television news and especially as women were entering that industry and significant numbers. I think we forget that, you know, I graduated from college Andy in 1979 and this was when women were really entering the workplace in big numbers. And so it was male dominated for quite a while. Women were in positions that were dependent on their male bosses. So that created a dynamic that just, I think, opened up for a lot of abuses. That, and add to that kind of the culture that existed. You know, a bit of Hollywood, we're going to make you a star. I control your fate. You are subservient to me. And I think that provided a recipe for that kind of really unacceptable behavior. And then you give them come back or should they be allowed to come back or talk about canceling people and people paying the price. I think a lot of it depends on your response to the allegations. I think people who recognize, I think James Franco did something very interesting that we haven't seen with a lot of these men who had been. I think that I don't know we could have a whole conversation of the word canceled. You know, I think they were removed with cause. You know, I think canceled sometimes suggests that a small. You know, a smaller or or infraction or whatever was overly penalized. So I think James Franco talked about, you know, getting help acknowledging his issues and trying to understand the damage that he did. And I think that other people should probably take a page from that playbook and do some serious introspection and then try to kind of contribute to, you know, be the change they that we hope to see. Instead of kind of digping in in their heels. But, you know, I think I think with any kind of social movement there, there is bound to be some collateral damage. Good, good point about how I use the word canceled, by the way. Well, I mean, I know I appreciate that. No, you are spot on. You know, you are, you are spot on. I want to switch over and get back to some of those tech companies in the platforms a little bit, because they're so powerful. And, you know, you're relying on them. We're relying on them. We're one of them in a way. But Facebook, Twitter. How are you thinking about them, Katie? Are they to blame for the widespread proliferation of misinformation? Should they be held responsible? Should they be broken up? I mean, there are a thousand big questions there, but just your thousand foot take. You know, it's, I wish I were even, you probably are more of an expert on this Andy than I am. I was a co-chair of the Aspen Commission on disinformation. And obviously we took a close look at some of these platforms. I mean, I think the problem with disinformation in our society is very multi-dimensional. But the algorithms and the way things are shared and amplified certainly I think have been, have been fueled by the social media platforms. You know, it's also lack of trust in mainstream media or more traditional media outlets. And also the democratization of information where everyone who has a digital device or iPad or a computer can spread misinformation and disinformation and malinformation. And so I think that we really do need to look, take a close look at the liability of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,51,2022-11-04 17:18:20
4864," And so I think that we really do need to look, take a close look at the liability of some of these platforms that claim they are not a publisher that they're just a platform. And Congress should get involved. I think the federal government needs to have a more unified approach because I don't think there's really a centralized policy arm of the government to deal with this. President Obama says disinformation is the biggest threat to our democracy. Certainly when you look at things like the big lie and the fact that more than 60, you know, courts and judges have said there's no merit to the argument that the election was rigged that it was one of the fairest elections in our history. But the fact that this persists that a huge percentage of the public and particularly the Republican Party continues to believe that the election was rigged. Obviously they're getting this information and it's being reinforced over and over again. And though people gave me a hard time because when I was on Bill Mar, I talked about the need for people to be deprogrammed, which really met just kind of separating themselves from, you know, the information that they're being almost brainwashed to believe through the, you know, repeated serving up of disinformation. I think we need to take a multi-pronged approach and get everyone involved. And I think that people who spread it, who are quote unquote super spreaders, should be held liable for spreading this disinformation, whether it's about COVID or vaccines or about Sandy Hook. And, you know, I think that platforms need to be more aggressive about monitoring it. Of course, the problem and it's not a problem. But the sticky wicked in America is free speech. And how do you balance free speech with the need to have outright lies be, you know, be removed and not not see the light of day. And where unfortunately an audience is receptive to believing them. Yeah, it goes back to the topic is. But it all does go back to can you yell fire in a crowded theater? I mean, it's also timeless. But now it's just this new way of getting the information that sort of, you know, it's a super spreader. And I think the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court said you cannot yell fire. And similarly, you know, I think this is the semantic version of yelling fire in a crowded theater. And, you know, I think, I think the technology has almost outrun the ethical considerations of all this, but it's, it's a really serious problem. I think it's shaping up to even be more serious in 2024. And it's something that, that we need to pay attention to. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,52,2022-11-04 17:22:40

I'm wondering how you feel about that or what you would tell young people are young women and maybe in particular about And there's some amazing high quality, excellent journalism that's being done on a daily basis. So I think journalism is still a really noble profession. The problem is so much of journalism has seeped into commentary. And you know, there's a big argument going on in newsrooms across the country. When should you be an advocate? When should you be a journalist? And is there a way to be both? So, you know, my daughter is working on a documentary about the origin and so the conservative movement and William F. Buckley in particular. And she was an American studies major at Stanford. She is extremely smart. And I think exploring this is really, really interesting and really important. And so I think that we need to have great people attracted to journalism. We need smart, curious young people, men and women. And people who represent this country demographically. So we're talking about people from all kind of socio-economic backgrounds, Andy, people from different, who've had different experiences. Because of their race and ethnicity, we need to be kind of this great American will, you know, by between 44 white people will be in the minority in this country. And we just need to make sure that our journalists represent the people they're serving. Having said that, I do think we need to look at the model of journalism. And I know a lot of people are thinking about this and talking about it. And we need to be restored trust in the media. How can we be less polarized and speak to just one audience or the other? I think that's a really challenging question. But I think it's one that deserves a lot of attention and thought. And I think we need a lot of people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,53,2022-11-04 17:26:53
4866," I think that's a really challenging question, but I think it's one that deserves a lot of attention and thought, and I think we need a lot of people, young people, smart young people, who can maybe look at it and look at it in a different way. And are we forever going to be siloed and have our own information? My friend Nicole Seligman talks about affirmation instead of information. I think these are all big, head-e-medie topics, and we need the greatest minds in the country to focus on them. So I would encourage people, especially idealistic people to go into journalism. Great, we're almost at a time, Katie. So quickly, if you can, what do you see as your legacy? Well, I hope that I contributed to the national conversation and help people understand complicated issues. I hope that I helped show that women were capable, and that it's interesting to think about the fact that in 2006, it was such a big deal to have a woman do the evening news. And now we see the evening news is declining in terms of its influence and importance. They still have a lot of people watching, but much older demographics. And I think very few young people are watching the network evening newscast. But I hope that I helped move the ball a little bit forward for women. Wasn't easy, I write extensively about my experience at CBS. And I think I was met with a lot of resistance there, partially because I think, well, there are a whole lot of reasons which I detail in the book. But I hope that I moved the ball forward for women, whether it was asking that I had a 50-50 division of labor on the today's show with Brian Gumball or took the leap and became the first solo female anchor of an evening newscast. And I also hope that I try to explore important topics and do it honestly. And that I have the vulnerability and humility to say when there were times when I didn't get it right, I don't know any journalists who batted 1,000 for decades. And I think that, you know, I'm proud of myself that I had the courage to say, maybe I could have done something differently or why did I approach a topic this way? Or here were some of the factors that were influencing me when I was making decisions because when all is said and done, journalists are human beings. They're not perfect. They try, I think, to do the best job they can mostly. And so I hope that I'll be seen as somebody, you know, who did what my father told me my entire life, do your best and that's what I've done. And sometimes, you know, it's been great and sometimes I've fallen on my face. But to me, that's kind of a life well lived. And the ability to admit that is, I think, takes a lot of guts.

First let's get to Brad at the Wi-Fi interactive Brad all right Let's take a look at the Dow Jones industrial average kick things off at this the top of the 10 a.m Hour on this Friday congrats you made it to the end of the week here Dow Jones is up by about 1% right now Now as that composite you're seeing that higher by a little more than 1% as well the SCP 500 You're also seeing that hold on to gains by about 1.1% Let's just put this in a five-day context to see how the week is rounding out overall S&P 500 over the past five days still lower by about 3.5% Nasdaq composite that too in the red actually the deepest declineer of the US major averages this week And then additionally you're seeing the Dow Jones industrial average over the past five days still lower But solid movement at least to end out this trading week and that's on the back of today's jobs report Also taking a look first at the sectors now come back to this retail and apparel segment for a hot second in a moment But the sector activity that we're seeing here on the day We've gotten a little more mixed and actually now we have more laggards than Advancers here take a look energy is up 3% here on the day and actually let's put this in an intraday view and now we're in The correct correlation there to today's activity all 11 S&P 500 sectors in positive territory And then just briefly going back to those apparel names that we've been tracking as there's been some fresh news out of Adidas as they've named a new CEO Bjorn golden going to become the CEO of Adidas and so Adidas is up by about 14% right now At least the shares that trade overseas are right now so we'll continue to watch that but moving forward here on the day The US has added 261,000 jobs in October while unionizing efforts continue to make its way through the labor market Starbucks made one of many companies all too familiar with workers unionization efforts. Here's what's the F.O Rachel Regeri had to say on the matter We truly believe a side-by-side relationship with our partner is the very best path forward But we respect the process what we're focused on is continuing to create the very best experience for our partners We know that that has worked for the last 50 years and we're confident It actually underpins the success of our new era of growth. So that's where we're focused And to take a closer look at the labor movement in the US and workers rights We have Mary Kay Henry international president of the service employees International Union. Thank you so much for taking the time here with us this morning First and foremost just got to get your reaction to what you heard from the Starbucks CFO Well, if that was the case Then workers would be at a bargaining table and being able to have a say directly on the job and instead the Starbucks Is choosing to fight tooth and nail closed stores when people unionize and we really Welcome the day when the CFO's comments are the reality with Starbucks because the partners love that company And they want to see at the table and a voice on the job and to be respected protected and paid what they're worth Mary Kay, Julie here. I'm curious if you've ever had an experience where a company has said Come on in. Let's yes, we're happy to have union to your let's negotiate I mean, is it is it much more the norm to have more of an an adversarial relationship? Well, there's been periods in American history where employers have said Come on in when Kaiser Permanente was founded in the 40s in California It opened as a healthcare Provider that all the jobs were union and today they have the highest patient satisfaction and the Employee satisfaction in the healthcare sector Harley Davidson it was a conflict with those workers, but now the United Steel workers and Harley Davidson have a very Good relationship and the company's profitable. So it's true I think what you're saying the norm in the US economy is for corporations to resist Workers who want to join together and we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,55,2022-11-04 17:35:38
4868," is for corporations to resist. Workers who want to join together, and we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that I believe are driving wages up, even though wage growth is slowing, as we have this terrific jobs report this month. And I think that's why we're going to continue to see workers joining together at Starbucks, Amazon, fast food, airports, and across the service and care sector, because people want to turn poverty wage jobs into good jobs that they can raise their families on. Mary Kay, what would getting it right look like for Starbucks? Are you talking $25 an hour and a guaranteed 40 hours a week? Well, getting it right would be recognizing the union at the 250 stores that have already voted to join the union and allowing workers who want to file for elections. The ability to do it without their managers interfering with it or changing their schedules or moving people around stores. The continued anti-union campaign should stop. That would be a way to get it right. And then ultimately, it would be terrific if Starbucks would break with major corporations in the US and do what they do in other countries around the world and set a national bargaining table where there could be a standard as you're suggesting that the workers and the corporation could figure out together. This is in a climate where corporate profits are at an all-time high, highest in 70 years. And so that's why I think the Starbucks and Amazon organizing is connected to the economic health of major corporations here in this country and around the world. And it's why things would go so much better if employers would stop resisting the union and start respecting the right of workers to decide for themselves whether they want to be in a union. Well, it's also driven by the workers' shortage. It's hard to find people to fill those positions. And so we've seen this period of a little bit more of the power being put back in the workers' hands. But that might be about to shift again. If we're heading into a recession, if we are going to see the job market turn around in the next year. So could that also change the dynamics for unions? I actually think what's driving workers to join together in unions is beyond the shortage. And is about the two-year pandemic that people just work their way through and had the experience of their co-workers get hardest hit by the pandemic because people were showing up every day, often without the personal protective equipment they needed. And I think when people continue to work and we're facing life and death choices, I've heard this directly from nurses, retail workers, fast food workers, they've decided that when their employer started to resist them and threaten their job, that was like, okay, if you're going to threaten to fire me, after I just spent two years risking my life to show up to work, then I probably don't need this job. And that's why I'm going to join together with my co-workers and create a collective bargaining agreement so that workers can be respected on the job, protected in their health, and paid what they're worth. Mary Kay Henry, SEIU, International President, good to see you. Have a great weekend. Thank you. All right, the U.S. economy created 261,000 jobs in the month of October. Let's get more of a pulse on the jobs market with U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. Marty, always good to see you here this morning. You're taking these job numbers. I mean, certainly, they're good job numbers with low unemployment. I like seeing that every month. And what was starting to see, I think, is nice as a slow-steady growth in our economy. And I think that we're not getting, certainly, the slowdown that a lot of people want to see or alleging they need to bring the inflationary pressures down. But I think we are sat in the sea slow-steady growth as we move forward here. Do you believe that we'll see more people come back into the workforce, those who have perhaps sat on the sideline for one reason or another, whether that's childcare, or whether that's the coronavirus pandemic and workplace issues, whatever that may be, that they'll start to come back into the workforce. If we do see a deep recession or at least a more pronounced recession. I think we'll definitely see more people go back into the workforce. I mean, there's lots of job openings in the country right now. And, you know, we were talking about that this morning, what I went out of the office in BLS is to see with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,56,2022-11-04 17:40:05
4869," We're back into the workforce. I mean, there's lots of job openings in the country right now and, you know, we're talking about that this morning, what I was, what I went out of the office and BLS is to see where the job openings are and, you know, when you think about job openings, the largest job openings in our country are in lower paying jobs. They're in, you know, hospital, in hospitality industries. And yet, we're starting to see people come back into the workforce and they have higher skills and degrees and they're looking to get into better paying jobs. So right now, as we move forward here, we've got to make sure we're partnering jobs with people and what their ability to do is, and I think that that's something that we have to really think about moving forward. At least that's what I'm thinking about moving forward here at the Department of Labor. Marty, maybe some of those people going to be in these jobs will be laid off software engineers. I don't know because we're hearing about, or people who are looking for job in that sector and there's not that job anymore. We're hearing about a lot of tech companies that are either cutting or freezing hiring right now. There's just a report that Elon Musk now that he owns Twitter is going to cut 3,700 people there. I know that you had talked to Musk in the past regarding his build out in Texas for Tesla. Now he's cutting jobs in his other business and his newly acquired business. I'm just curious what you think about that sort of flow of jobs there. Well, certainly one thing in this jobs report that's not reflected yet in this. Certainly I'm keeping a close eye on that because I dig the tech sector in the United States over the last several years, certainly has grown. Those are good paying jobs and those are jobs that are in lots of cities like Austin, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, out in New York and Chicago, places like that. We have to dive into that a little more. We haven't seen, I don't think a lot of life's here, but there's been lots of talk of layoffs and freezing hiring. So, certainly that's something that would concern me because they have good paying jobs and a lot of states and cities and places around the country have built out expansion of their cities, whether building new housing, things like that. It's for this sector, this tech sector. So it's something that I'm interested in. I'm going to dive more into and certainly offering right now to any tech company out there, anything that we can do at the Department of Labor to help you in a situation. I'd love to do that. As far as Twitter, I mean, that's a whole different situation. I don't know enough about it, but I think that's Elon Musk and looking at the business model. I'm sure at some point that will fix itself out as it moves forward. While we have you, we do know that there's been a move from New York City, this recent, of course, in the salary transparency that's come forward, and regardless of what's started, it's gotten off to. I think there is still this broader recognition that there can be more room for salary transparency that is beneficial to both the employee and the employer. What would you like to see on that front as New York City has already rolled this out, but perhaps where some other cities and states could also have that type of transparency that leads to a more healthy employer, employee relationship and kind of reduces some of the parity issues in pay scale? Yeah. Well, we did that in Boston. When I was in the mayor of Boston, we had 200 companies in the city that gave us the pay data and anonymously were able to dissect it and really work on pay equity and making sure that women and men were paid the same. We made some really good gains in the city of Boston. It wasn't heavy handed. The companies came to the table. These are the large corporations. And I think having these conversations are really important. And coming up with policies moving forward or important, we were successful in the city of Boston. They're still hopefully still doing it in the city of Boston. And now the place is it really is about having these conversations and not just in pay equity and transparency, but also in leadership of companies and getting women on boards and things like that. All of those, you know, those are important aspects of growth and moving forward. You know, legislation has passed often about pay equity. We shouldn't, women shouldn't need legislation to be paid the same as a man. Women should be paid the same as a man for doing the same exact work. And that's something that, not just elected officials, but CEOs of companies should work on. And the way to the time has come to make this make make equity in the workplace consistent. Mr. Secretary, this jobs report just continues a string of really solid to strong labor market reports, but it comes against the backdrop of slowing or declining productivity in this country. I do you think the hustle culture this country was founded on is just done. Yeah. I went up. My name's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,57,2022-11-04 17:44:31
4870," in this country. I do you think the hustle culture, this country was founded on, is just done. Yeah, my economy just went over that with me yesterday and I was trying to get a good reason on how we measure productivity in the United States America. And I think that we're still working through that. I mean, I think the productivity America is strong. I think that when the terminology of quiet quits came up or all of that happening, I never heard it in the communities. I haven't heard it when I was out there talking. I think American workers are still working strong. They're working, getting paid. I've been on a lot of construction sites. I've been in a lot of manufacturing facilities. Those workers aren't slowing down. Those workers are working hard. So I think that, you know, again, I don't know enough about the data. I don't think the data is consistent or strong as it should be to really tell the true story of American workers. All right, we'll leave it there. US Labor Secretary, Mari Walsh, Walsh, always good to see you. Have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. And we'll be right back. Now it's some other headlines that we're watching at this hour. The Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, or PIF, says it will make electric cars in the kingdom under a joint venture with Apple supplier FoxCarn. That's part of a push to build new industries and lessen the nation's dependence on oil. FoxCarn will develop the electrical architecture of the vehicles. And Seer will be the name of the first Saudi automotive brand to produce electric vehicles in Saudi Arabia. The PIF said its cars would be available in 2025. And Seer is projected to contribute $8 million to the Kingdom's GDP by 2034. Chrysler parent Stellantis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,58,2022-11-04 17:48:57
4871," Available in 2025 and CIR is projected to contribute $8 million to the Kingdom's GDP by 2034. Chrysler parent Stellantis warning nearly 300,000 vehicle owners immediately to stop driving their cars after three crash deaths tied to faulty Takata airbagging flaters were reported in the last seven months. The Do Not Drive warning is currently in place for owners of previously recalled 2005 to 2010 Dodge Magnum Station wagon. Dodge Challenger Coops and Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans that had not addressed that airbag issue. And Aldi is doing a Thanksgiving price rewind in an effort to draw customers to its chain amid surging inflation. The grocery retailer lowered prices for its Thanksgiving dinner food items to match 2019 prices. That means discounts of up to 30% for select items. If you recall, we reported earlier this week that Walmart announced a similar pricing strategy, but they're just rolling it back to last year's prices. That would be about a 15% discount. So Aldi saying, no, no, no, no, we're going all the way back to 2019. Hold my turkey. Wait a minute. Something like that. Hold the gravy, whatever. Anyway, it has been a rough year for the semiconductor sector first companies such as AMD and Nvidia could not get enough chips to supply customers. And now slowing PC sales are hurting the industry. Shares of chip makers, they've been sliding all year and it could get worse. So Z is here with his take on this one. Yeah, nothing like dumping this negativity on a day when all the chip stocks are up. And nonetheless, highlighting a good note from cities, Chris Daly, really one of my favorite chip analysts out there on Wall Street. He's offering up some good reasons why the sell-off and chip stocks and the socks index or the Philadelphia semiconductor index might be really ripe for further another sell-off here. First, industrial end market demand is rolling over red flag there as well. Auto sales are in fact cooling. A lot of chips, of course, get used in various automobiles. PC and handset demand are correcting. We've heard that. We have heard that within the past two weeks from the likes of an Intel and an AMD. That PC correction is alive and well and it has been very ugly for a lot of players. And even too, the handset market as well has been correcting as we've learned from Qualcomm's warning yesterday. And then lastly, companies are more tightly managing capital expenditures. It is full on. It continues to be budget planning season in corporate America. And we're starting to see a lot of, I would just say tighter cap X budgets for next year. Maybe that means a fewer less chips. Now of course, there you can see that Philadelphia semiconductor index on the screen right there. That has been, it has not been a good year for that, not a good year for an AMD and Nvidia and many other players in that semiconductor index. Daily things, EPS estimates for chip stocks can tank at least another 20% from where they are now. That would be a big plunge and likely put further pressure to his point on the stocks and that the stocks index could plunge at least 15% as those earnings estimates come down. And my take here in search for bottom, you know, it definitely brings up a couple good points on what would ultimately cause that bottom in chip stocks. For him, it is the end market no longer correcting, valuation just reaching levels that are truly trough and no more cap X cuts. And I'm trying to figure out why I'm in a basket. Is that what that is? I think that's a basket of trash can. It's a trash can. Wow. That's a waste. Wow, that's a waste. That's awesome. That looks like a wicker basket, like a laundry wicker basket. It's a trash can. I feel like I made it. And it's a trash can. It's a trash can. Okay. Well, we'll see what happens with chips. I mean, you know, it depends on the time horizon you look at. Because it's interesting when you talk to some investors and they say the, you know, chips obviously we're still going to meet them. Yes. And so if you're an investor who's looking at five years, ten years, you might have, if you have that luxury, you might have a different sort of assessment here of what this group looks like. Yeah. Look, AMD's business is still growing. Qualcomm is still growing. It's just a matter of, they're not growing at the rates that they were and the growth rates have really, really, really stalled. I think that Qualcomm report was just not good on many accounts this week. Yeah. And signal a lot of things, many of which you pointed out and you're taking today's hours. Appreciate it. Guys coming up, payment platform round up. We're going to break down the earnings from Block and PayPal with BTIG's Mark Palmer. Let's come up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,59,2022-11-04 17:53:14
4872," is Payment platforms block and PayPal. They are on the move today, but in divergent ways. After PayPal cut its full year revenue forecast while block, so a 51% pop in its cash at business year over year. BTIG, managing director Mark Palmer, joins us now. Mark, great to get some of your perspective here on these two fintech names. Now we're seeing the stocks react in very different ways here, but of course the company is saying something very different about what their forecasts may look like. Perhaps we can start with a block. Key takeaways and what was the catalyst kind of going forward for them that is different from PayPal? Yes, thanks very much for having me on today. Block is in a very different position than PayPal. Especially because through its cash app, it is offering a bank account substitute to consumers, particularly in the lower end of the income spectrum, who really benefit from those types of services, especially to time when a lot of banks focusing on their own profitability are growing up the gates and letting less consumers to start bank accounts within their platforms. So it's got a mission critical functionality while at the same time, its seller ecosystem, which is basically allowing points of sale payments, has remained robust, which we believe is largely because the company is offering tools to small businesses and medium-sized businesses that enable them to better manage their payment needs. Mark, it's Julie here. It's good to see you talk to me about cash app versus Venmo because I sort of think of those in the same bucket, although I know cash app sort of has broader applications.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,60,2022-11-04 17:57:36
4873," How is this company going to be able to sustain growth? They're guiding initially to 15% earnings growth in 2023. But at the same time, they're making a lot of statements about the vulnerability of their end consumer to an uncertain macroeconomic environment, thus putting that 15% growth in a very risky position right out of the bat. Mark, you're out here this morning, keeping your buy rating on Coinbase F their earnings last night, but taking your price target to $110 from 220. When will this company live up to its promise? Well, I think that's largely a function of what's going to happen in the end market. Coinbase can and is setting its sales, but it can't control the wind. And the wind in this case is the crypto market, which is very much correlated with risk assets in general. And as the federal reserve continues to tighten, the outlook there is very much uncertain. So what are we seeing? We're seeing Coinbase preserve its optionality by focusing on maintaining a large cash balance, building out its institutional prime brokerage platform, and continuing to add new functionality and areas like staking that are relevant to those in the crypto space. So I think what we are seeing now is a lot of building that's going on, not only in Coinbase, but among Web 3 platforms in general, in anticipation of getting a bit more of a tailwind so that you can see the full realization of the platform's potential. BTIG, managing director, Mark Palmer, always good to see you. Have a good weekend. It's a talk to you. Coming up, what's on tap for Disney's earnings next week?

4874," Shares of Corona are getting run over after posting a wireland expected loss for the third quarter. I mean, it's softening demand for pre-owned vehicles. Prosper mating joins us now. Pros, not a good quarter from Carvana, but again, more pressure on the shares here. Yeah, it seems like these high rates are really hurting there. You know, most people with vine ants, there's their cars, 40 million Americans buy used cars every year. Carvana, I'm going to tell you about how this is a rate-sensitive kind of purchase. Like he said, big mists on the top and bottom line. Gross proper vehicle down a thousand bucks, Euro-earned. That's a lot of, that's a huge kind of like decrease in your profit margin there. So, you know, they said things would get worse for them to get any better. So there's not much there for them to kind of like, hopefully hang their head on soon. But, and then in dice going to cake is they suspended their guidance, right? So they can't kind of see what's, what's next given how uncertain things are. So, you know, the Carvana business model has been hurting all year, right? As we've sort of seen things kind of slow down, rates go up. And the question is, is this rock bottom? And then are they going to kind of like, you know, it's a good product, right? It's a really easy thing people like buying their cars online. So it's like, it's got value that the question is, can they make it a profitable venture? We also saw some news this morning that Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, they're selling shares of a China-based EV maker. So can you tell us more about that? So many years ago, B-Widey, Berkshire bought a pretty significant stake in B-Widey by 20%. They've held on for about 10 years and they started selling little slivers of it, starting late this summer. This is the third, I believe third sale they've done. Another, I think I believe another 3 million shares here. They sold about a million and a half also in September. So it's still, they sell over 200 million shares. So it's still like a significant kind of holding. But the question is, is Warren ready to kind of exit this? If they made a lot of money off this stake, they bought it for 225 million, I think 10 years ago. And now it's over 10 years ago, and now it's worth 7 million, I think. So the question is, when is it time to exit? Does it see it as a long-term Buffett player? Or is it time to sort of like reevaluate? Interesting. We saw those shares rallying just now along with other Chinese stocks during the session. So interesting. Thanks, Frost. Appreciate it. And also looking ahead to the Walt Disney Company next week, it's set to report earnings. We see the shares up about 1.5% or so today. There is a lot going on when it comes to Disney from the parks around the world. Remember, we just had reports of Shanghai Disney being shut for a bit because of COVID there to the streaming landscape here in the US a lot to consider. And considering all of it, is our Alexander Canal who's here with us and said, hey, Ali, so what's the sort of big picture numbers you're going to be looking for? Well, clearly we learned a lot from Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount. And it comes to the state of the market right now, obviously the weakening ad market impacting their bottom line. I expect that to happen to Disney a little bit, but this company has a lot of levers to pull. I spoke with Tim Nolan from a choir. He reiterated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% year to date, but he did note that over the long term, this company has a lot to look forward to. What you're looking on your screen now is a Wall Street projections. We have a new expected to come in at 21.27 billion, adjust the DPS of 51 cents, parks, experiences and consumer products revenue at 7.59 billion. But a really important number is that operating income. 1.9 billion is expectation. That's less than what we saw in the third quarter, but we could see a little bit of an impact from Hurricane E in there. Perhaps some of that Shanghai Disney closures. And then those Disney plus subscribers expected to come in at 9.35 million. Now what Nolan told me to watch is that direct to consumer subscriber figure. Like I said, 9.5 million expected along with that ad tier expectation. How will that add to the company's bottom line? Nolan estimated that ad revenues could surge up to 800 million in 2023. Thanks to Disney plus, that's sort of the overall market opportunity there. And then on the park side, you want to make sure that gross bookings aren't going down that there's no recessionary impact. The analyst pointed out that in 2009, the last financial crisis, park revenue fell 7%. But there's a bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases to prices, updates to the park, the Disney plus app, etc. And then finally, the impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,62,2022-11-04 18:09:26
4875," A bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases, to prices, updates to the park, the Genie Plus app, etc. And then finally, the impact of that advertising slowdown. ESPN I think is pretty insulated from all of that. But ESPN and other big question, right? Looking forward to the company, what's the DTC future of this? Because right now it's clearly more profitable in a linear world than it is in an OTT world. But something that Bob Chapich will have to think about as well. I think there's too much optimism around Disney Plus coming into the report. And keep in mind, this comes against a back to it. Look, we heard from Roku this week. A major slowdown in their business. Netflix, probably some squishy areas in its quarter as well. Power Round Plus, now looking potentially lay people off. It hasn't been a good looking streaming. Hasn't been a good looking streaming. But Disney is not just a streaming company, right? They have a lot of different components to the business. And there's a lot of confidence that they can enter this new world and be very successful at it. If you think about advertising, Disney has a really good base in this. They've really crushed it with Hulu. They have the experience on the linear side. Unfortunately, that adds slowdown. There's not what you can do with that, right? There will be some overhang there. We'll cloud the outlook overall. But overall, I think they're in a good position. They made a lot of investments to Disney Plus. We have a lot of exclusive content that's coming to that service, disenchanted, one of the ones that I'm very excited about that's coming. And I think that content spend is going to slow down significantly over the next few quarters in the next few years. And that's going to positively impact Ipa Tess. So a lot of macro concerns, but I think for this company, they're in a really solid position moving forward. And also with Disney, there's the consideration that on the streaming side too, we could see some more focus around ad tiers at a time where Netflix is rolling out and pulled forward the timeline for themselves to launch that. And so now that we've started to see that pop up in the market and perhaps see what some reception looks like. How have the early days been for Netflix? Well, Netflix just launched their ad here in the US. Yesterday, a $6.99 price point slightly below Disney Plus' upcoming ad supported tier at $7.99. It's going to be a wait and see approach. We're not going to have all the answers this quarter. I think it's going to take a few quarters. So we can really see that impact. I do think across the board, streamers have been exploring price increases. Warner Brothers Discovery on the earnings call last night. They actually pushed up the timeline for that combo service between HBO Max and Discovery to the spring. They said there's a lot of options with pricing sort of hinted that price increases will be coming there. And so pricing is something to really focus on when we think about all of these streaming giants. And I think that's a big component that's going to be important in the quarters to come. Looking forward to Disney. Thanks. So I want to get it. I appreciate it. Coming up, we're going to check in on the state of the restaurant industry and small business. We'll see you at Stockware Company. Lightspeed. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,63,2022-11-04 18:13:55
4876," this So if we're coming to light speed, took a hit this quarter from macro forces, including reduced customer spend at businesses and 4X swing, sitting transaction revenue. But with light speed banking on a move up market, after seeing increased spend, can't it close the sale. The shares are hired today after something yesterday following the numbers and joining us with more is JP Chavez. He is light speed chief executive officer. JP, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. What are you seeing amongst your clients? And we should tell viewers clients are restaurants, but other types of smaller side businesses as well. What are you hearing from them right now? Yeah, so the majority of our customers are restaurants, yours and retailers in the SMB space. And really what we're hearing from them, it's a unique moment in time. The post pandemic world with returned physical has created much more complexity for their businesses because you have the physical world meets the digital world. And also what we're seeing is that it's a cost of labor is gone up, scarcity in terms of trying to hire people and now alluming recession. So it's a really difficult time for our customers and for the market. And here the only way forward for our customers is to adopt technologies like cars that can help them do more with less and automate a lot of the manual tasks. And are they convinced of that, JP? Because as I mentioned, you all had a pretty tough quarter last quarter. You're not just selling software technology to folks. You're also selling hardware in the form of a point of sale system. And are you seeing people retrench or is it just a matter of seeing slower growth? No, so it depends what you call slower growth. We had a 38% growth the year over year. And if you look at the segment of the customers above $500,000, there was 25% growth in store count and above a million dollars, we had a 30% growth. So we are a strong growth player. On what we can control, it was a really good quarter. We beat on also an EBITDA and we beat on the outlook. So for us, it was a very good quarter. What hurt us is what we are planning for in the future. We think there will be a bit of softness, not in terms of our customers and demands, but in terms of the GMV of our customers. And because we are rewarded as a percentage of their revenues, of course, that's going to impact. But still, we are planning very strong growth for the second half of the year. What is the most difficult thing about operating through this particular environment from the CEO perspective? Yeah, well, I mean, this short term versus long term. But light speed, we are a great business, we're building a business that's going to last forever. And then you have the daily fluctuations, investor feelings. But I think for us, the way we look at it, we've outlined the plan, we're ahead of this plan, and we're doing really well. Now there are things we can't control. A currency exchange rates, we do 40% of our business outside of the US. And then the other thing we can't control is consumer buying. But on what we can control, this has been a really good quarter and the business is doing really well. So, IPF, have you followed your colleagues, excuse me, appears in tech and implemented hiring freezes or layoffs? Well, most of the companies that are hiring...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,64,2022-11-04 18:18:19
4877," J.P., have you followed your colleagues, excuse me, appears in tech and implemented hiring freezes or layoffs? Well, most of the companies that are hiring freezes or doing these are not companies that are growing the way we are. These are companies that were pure digital. Light speed, the majority of our businesses have physical presences and as you know, the markets or the consumers have returned to shopping and dining in person. So we are a strong growth story. So we are actually looking today for, I think we have 360 positions open on our website because the company is going to be growing. Now this being said, we have a path to profitability. Next fiscal year, we want to be evict that positive and we plan on doing that, but we have to hire enough people to sustain the growth that we are currently having. And J.P., I'm curious what you're hearing from your clients on the hiring front as well. As you mentioned, restaurants, small retailers, etc. We just got the jobs report today that show they're still growth in things like hospitality jobs, for example. It has gotten easier for these businesses to find people to hire. And that is actually the biggest issue in our industry is that it's very difficult to hire people right now. Most of the people who are working in the hospitality and the retail space found out their jobs during COVID and left the industry and they're having a hard time getting them back into the industry. I think that's really what's hurting our customers right now. And that's why we think it's probably a moment in time and a unique moment in time for light speed because the only way out for our customers because they can't hire enough people is to have platforms that help them automate. And unfortunately for the market, the majority of the systems out there right now are legacy platforms that are really not really efficient in terms of helping them operate in this environment. Have you seen in the data that you're able to kind of glean insights into for all of the businesses that leverage your platform or leverage your service that there is any major pullback or shift at least in the way that businesses are being able to conduct different services whether that be on the food front or whether that be on wherever the platform may be. If the consumers are actually pulling back on their spend or shifting dramatically how they're spending. So for now we haven't well we've seen the big shift we've seen with consumers because we do have also delivery platforms and we also connect with all of the order ahead platforms. What we have seen very clearly is from the end of the pandemic to today there's a very there's a massive return into physical. So that means our customers are selling more and more in their physical spaces. So I think and that's really the complexity right now is that the consumers are still consuming online. They're still using delivery and order ahead but they're also consuming in the physical space which means that for the customers it's more difficult than ever to manage these. And so you often see it you know when you go into restaurants and they have four or five iPads and each of every iPad is for you know different delivery network or and that's where we can help them we can go in and integrate those platforms and make it much simpler for them to run their businesses. So we have seen this big shift and then on a on a consumer basis what we've seen is summer was very strong for hospitality. We've seen a lot of people just return to restaurants and we're starting to see a slight slowdown in terms of of consuming but we are still you know in very healthy healthy volumes. JP JP great to have you here with us this morning JP Showway who is the light speed chief executive officer here with us on Yahu Finance appreciate the time. Thanks for having me. Absolutely everyone let's take a brief look at the markets we've had the Dow ripping to the upside right now by about 500 points on the day it's up 537 540-ish points right now 1.7% in the green the S&P 500 you're also seeing that in the green to the tune of about 1.8% and the NASDAQ composite up 1.8% as well this comes on the back of a better than expected jobs reports but mix because we did have unemployment higher than expected there you're taking a look at some of the actual versus the estimates are what was anticipated coming into that an hourly wages that in line with expectations as well coming up everyone the earnings parade continues we've got reports from Funko virgin galactic and synomark to talk about on the other side of this break it's gonna get funky.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,65,2022-11-04 18:22:23
4878," אך collaborator..... Thank you. You You Welcome back. It's time for time and today we focus in on three separate earnings reports. One minute each. Let's start with this on the day. Shares of Funko ticker symbol FNK. Oh, it's down bad right now after missing. Yeah. Oh my gosh indeed. Missing on profit estimates and slashing guidance, reducing their profit forecast ahead of the holidays. Shares moving in a manner that would make everyone bobble their head. As we're taking a look at the activity on the day, it's down by 50% here. Shrug? Stunning. It's not, you know, I don't think the demand met the company's expectations. We should also note that J.P. Morgan now downgrading the stock. I guess that would happen when your stock loses 50%. But they are implementing a lot of new, I think, just processes and machines and technology inside the company to set their foundation for whatever they're looking to do. But this is a massive, massive day of value destruction for Funko. It seems like it's not as much the sales that are a problem. It's the profitability that's the problem. The EPS and EBITDA really had a big miss here. And the company is now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin in high single digits for the full year. Previous guidance was around 14.6%. If you look at the midpoint, so that's a big downgrade. Virgin Galactic, we're watching those shares as well. They're up 6% after reporting a wider than expected loss for the third quarter. It did top revenue projections. And most importantly, reaffirmed. It remains on track to launch space tourism services in the second quarter of 2023. And it's going to have its commercial spacecraft going up in the middle of next year. I mean, earning shmurnings for this thing. It doesn't obviously make any money yet. But it's all about the timeline here going forward. So that sort of confirmation is encouraging. No, you're making face problems. So it's going to take its space. It's going to take its to go into sub-oantorecession. Right into recession. Like my goodness. And it's economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,66,2022-11-04 18:26:39

It's really been Turn around story that they've needed to initiate from Exploring bankruptcy all the way to okay. How do we just make sure that with any titles that make it into our theater? We're able to stave off competition at the same time making sure that you are able to have enough employees to operate this I think I think for the experiences that I've had in the theater this year You could do it without a lot of employees and I hate to say that but it is become so streamlined from the point of purchasing Digitally to showing up watching the movie and then dip in yeah, well the company's just a debita is improving and beat estimates So that's helping matters as well kind of speaking to your point about maybe cutting some costs here The company said August and September were challenged by a dip in content availability That's come for not a lot of good movies out there I guess but anyway, so we're watching that all right.

4880," Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11 a.m. on the East Coast. Say it out here in the West. I'm Akiko Fujita. Happy Friday to all of you. Here's what I'm watching this hour. Mixed signals in the labor market. The US has 261,000 jobs in October, blowing past expectations. But the unemployment rate ticks higher to 3.7%. Those hot numbers signaling the fed will continue to raise rates a little longer. Layoffs at Twitter, thousands of Twitter employees bracing for news this morning. They may be out of a job. It's all part of a new owner and CEO Elon Musk's plan to revamp the social media giant. We're going to have all the details for you coming up. And it is a big morning for DoorDash shares are surging after a big third quarter earnings beat. We're going to break down the numbers for you. But first let's look at the check of the markets. We are 90 minutes into the trading day. And take a look at how stocks are. Resonance responding to that strong with unexpected jobs report. The down now up more than 500 points. The S&P 500 up 60 in the Nasdaq up 150. All the major averages, those still on track to close out the week in the red. With the Nasdaq seeing the steepest losses up today. But it is down on the week. And despite what we're seeing today, the tech heavy index on pace for its more weekly losses January of this year. We are beginning this morning though with that all important jobs number. 261,000 jobs added to the U.S. economy as unemployment rose to 3.7% in October. Now, as we said, that's a bit of a mixed report coming just days ahead of the midterm elections. Where Democrats are struggling to convince voters. They can get the job done on the economy. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Rick Newman. It's interesting because we've been talking so much about these job numbers as in good news and not necessarily good news for the markets. Today the markets are up. But if you think about where President Biden has positioned himself, especially going into the midterms, is this good news for the Democrats? I can't tell, honestly. But let's start with the headline number. 261,000 new jobs. I mean, the strength in the job market is astonishing. Economists keep saying we expect the labor market to slow down. We expect job growth to slow down. And it keeps not slowing down. Now, we are not adding jobs at the pace we were doing right after the COVID downturn when suddenly every employer had to catch up. But in a normal economy, in a decently growing economy, if you had just 200,000 new jobs per month, that would be a terrific pace of growth. And we've had far more than that all year long. And the slow down just keeps not coming. And yet I'm looking at all these analyses today. And everybody's disappointed. Everybody was hoping that there would be clearer signs of a slowing job market. And why is that? Because everybody wants the Fed to stop raising interest rates. And in order to do that, the Fed needs to see signs that a recession is coming, that job gains are slowing, that wage gains are slowing. So, you know, it's great that we're adding all these new jobs. And it's unfortunate that everybody is disappointed about that. I mean, with that said, Rick, you know, what does this mean in terms of messaging in the final days leading up to the midterms? We've heard the president go out and say, look, the economy is still strong. But voters are looking at where inflation is and saying, yep, how do you look at both in contact? Biden cannot win on the, he cannot win this messaging battle. He has had a strong labor market to brag about all year long. And it hasn't worked. And it just tells you how pervasive inflation is. And it tells you how ruinous inflation is for family budgets. I mean, I just did some new analysis this week. And one of the ironies here is that even though inflation is improving, the rate of inflation has declined from a high of 9% down to, it's now 8.2%. People are actually saying, giving signs that they are getting more worried about inflation, not less worried. And I think for a couple of reasons. Number one, the longer it lasts, the longer people think it's going to last. So inflation expectations for the next six to 12 months are very high. People think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,68,2022-11-04 18:35:23
4881," And I think for a couple of reasons, number one, the longer it lasts, the longer people think it's going to last. So inflation expectations for the next six to 12 months are very high. People think price, these price hikes are going to stay. And I think another thing that's happening is the longer people have to deal with inflation, the more it streams their family budget. So we got the wage and number today, average hour learning, 4.7%, ordinarily, that would be great. But with inflation at 8.2%, your paycheck buys less. People are literally falling behind and the longer that goes on, the worse it is for the incumbent Democrats. So it looks like Biden and his fellow Democrats are going to lose at least one chamber of Congress next week. I think the only question is, are the polls accurate? If the polls are accurate, then it's going to be a bad night for Democrats. So if Democrats are hoping for anything at all at this point, it's at the polls are wrong. And really quickly, Rick, for the Republicans out of things, they've certainly seen strength in the economy, at least that they see that things, at least voters are not necessarily optimistic about where the economy is headed. That's positive for the Republicans. They look at the jobs number today. How do you think they spend this one? They are there. It's the same way they've been spitting it. They just keep pointing to inflation. And that's all they need to do. So I don't think you're going to hear any Democrats saying much, excuse me, Republicans saying much at all about the labor market. They're just going to keep saying Americans cannot afford the basics. And they're not wrong about that. Yeah, just hammering home the word inflation seems to be working for the Republicans so far. Rick Newman has always thanks so much for that. She agreed. For deeper insight, look on what the latest jobs data means for the Fed and the U.S. economy. Let's get right to ADP chief economist, Nila Richardson. Nila's Rick said, when you think about the tight labor market, that has really been one of the biggest hurdles for the Fed and its attempt to cool off the economy. What are the numbers today tell you about how much more the Fed needs to do to get it where they want it to be? Hi, great to be with you. Look, the Fed may not be able to go through the labor market to get to lower inflation. I think that's what the numbers tell us today. We're seeing really steady and robust job gains. The BLS report today was pretty broad base. Little different than what the ADP numbers showed earlier this week in terms of the broadness of the hiring, but in terms of the number of jobs created, we showed 239,000 private sector jobs. BLS, it was 230, so you're seeing the same kind of alignment when it comes to these monthly job gains. For the Fed, that means that it's not the labor market that's seeing weakness. It's things like housing and maybe stocks, but not the stock market today. So they have their work cut out for them. Yeah, it's been interesting to see the reaction and the past we've sourcing the strong jobs numbers kind of lead to declines in the broader market. What, you put this in context for us right now because you said, look, it's not necessarily the labor market that the Fed has to deal with. It's other areas like housing. Are there other levers that you think the central bank can be pulling when you consider that the rate hikes they've implemented so far haven't necessarily led to a significant cooling off of the labor market? The Fed has fundamentally won that that's rate hikes. Unfortunately, they can go faster, they can go slower, but they're still going to hike rates. I think what we are anticipating, at least I am, is that not just that they hike, but that they hike and they stay at an elevated federal funds rate where it's a period of time to bring back inflation. The bottom line is when you look at the labor market, when you look at consumer spending, this is a long game for the Fed. It is not a short game. And that means that rates are likely to stay higher for longer than was originally anticipated by the Fed. wage gain certainly something we've been keeping a watch on as we know so many companies have had to deal with the higher cost that have come with a very tight labor market. hourly earnings up 0.4% in October for the previous month. We are seeing a slight cooling down if you can call it that, but what are you hearing from employers who are saying, look, we can't necessarily fill the jobs, but maybe we don't necessarily have to dangle the same incentives we did six months ago. Well, 80 p pace 1 instance six workers in the United States. We have a lot of payroll data. When we look at pay growth, what we're saying is exactly what you see in this BLS report. So what were our food products?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,69,2022-11-04 18:39:52
4882," case one and since six workers in the United States. We have a lot of payroll data. When we look at pay growth, what we're seeing is exactly what you see in this BLS report. It's exactly what Powell pointed to in this press release that wage growth is slowing, but it's slowing to and stabilizing at an elevated level. It's still much higher than it was this time last year. So wages are not likely pushing up inflation, but it makes key inflation prolonged at the current level. And what we're hearing from our clients, especially our small business clients, is that it's still a tough time finding qualified workers, especially in consumer facing industries like restaurants, leisure and hotel accommodations. And so there's still a struggle here for the smaller firms who were out competed by larger firms earlier on in the recovery. Now is their chance to hire some of these larger firms take a pause. It's been a situation of good news, sometimes doing bad news in this report specifically. I guess the bad news that could be good news is that unemployment did tick a little higher. We're talking about 3.7%, which is still historically pretty low. I mean, how much higher do you think that number needs to go in order to see a real cooling up? Well, I focus on the real economy on the jobs market. So good jobs numbers are good news always. And I think the unemployment number, we have to put it in context. It's still below four percent. It's still at historical lows. That number is coming from the household survey, which is a little less reliable. That number, the 3.7% is likely going to take up back and forth over the next couple of months. But the punchline here is that we're still seeing job gains. And if you match that data to the initial jobless claims numbers that are still around pre-pandemic levels, we're not seeing a lot of firms starting to lay off in mass. And that's good news for Main Street. Main Street is the bulk of the economy. So that's good news for economic growth. Yeah, a lot of the layoff news largely focused on places like tech. We did here, but hiring freezes in places like Amazon as well as Lyft. But we'll continue to watch that. Neelette's good to have you on today. Neelah Richardson, ADP Chief Economist. And here to take a closer look at the market action falling to a stronger than expected jobs data. We've got Yahoo Finance's Jared Blicchery standing by. And Jared, this is a big pop that we're seeing on the back of a strong jobs number. Yes, we are. And it's somewhat reminiscent to me of that big pop we got after the last CPI report, which should have been bearish by all accounts because it was coming in pretty hot. But guess what? The market is reacting pretty strongly. S&P 500 up over 1.25%. And the Dow is really outperforming. Let me just put a five-day chart here and we can see the Dow is still down about 1.25% for the week. But it has come back to the mid-range of that five-day range. Nasdaq still hovering down below. And boy, it has been a story of two different markets here when you consider tech and the value trade that's more heavily represented by the S&P 500 in the Dow. So here's the S&P 500. We're just kind of chopping around down here. 3,900, excuse me, 3,900, which is right here, is a huge level. And also this breakdown region from the Fed the other day, 3,800, also going to be big as kind of where we stop today. But all in all, I think investors will take this, especially after the carnage that they suffered just a few days ago at the hands of Paul Enkel. By the way, today, materials in the forefront, that's a story about China potentially re-opening, along with consumer discretionary financials, energy staples, and industrials, nice mix to see there, Akiko. And finally, Jared, we're seeing a pretty broad-based gains today in the market. But want to hone in on the energy space here. Oil, seeing a big pop today. We got that news from G7 countries that they had agreed to how exactly this Russian oil price cap would be implemented. And what more can you tell us about how exactly this is likely this way in terms of where oil prices are likely to move? Sure. The thinking now is that it's going to be a fixed price limit instead of one that varies with the price of oil. The number that I've seen floating around is $60 per barrel. You can see WTI here, which trades pretty closely to Brent Crude. That's up 4% today. I think that's more on the reports that we're getting a possible re-opening of China based on—",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,70,2022-11-04 18:44:19
4883," pretty closely to Brent Crude. That's up 4% today. I think that's more on the reports that we're getting a possible reopening of China based on the fact that they may be rescinding the Zero COVID, or at least revising that policy here today, but there is that European, I guess, ban sanctions that go into effect on December 5th. So this is ahead of that. I don't think it's going to be a huge deal for the oil market. I think it's going to come down to the demand characteristics and especially with these marginal swings that we've seen with respect to China, maybe a few other places. But you look at the broad complex and commodity is say a lot of green, a lot of dark green, and guess what, we're also seeing the US dollar come down appreciably, particularly against the Renminbi over in China. Yeah, a lot of countries looking at that and saying there's some relief and slight potentially a Jared Vlickery. Thanks so much for that. Let's take a look at shares of Funko, failing to get the topics looking for after disappointing earnings. That stock is down. More than 50 percent. That's right. The company behind the collectible figurines reported earnings of $0.28 a share in revenue of $365.6 million. That was higher than the street expected, but weak guidance for the all-important holiday season spent shares plummeting. The company now expects holiday growth and profit to remain relatively flat from the same period last year that prompted JP Morgan to downgrade the stock from overweight to neutral, the firm slashing Funko's price target in half to $16 a share. Well, coming up on the other side Starbucks credits customers adding more stuff like Syrups to their coffee for its earnings beat. Yeah, that trend continue. We'll talk to an analyst after the short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,71,2022-11-04 18:48:37
4884," One investor is giving shares of Starbucks a big jolt in this session today. That stock is up nearly 10%. The coffee chain posted a record quarter attributing its success to rising prices, even despite some economic headlines. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Brooke Dupalma, who's all over the numbers for us. And Brooke, you know, the good news is domestically, there are consumers who are spending more per visit. But there's some headwinds over these. We'll get to that. But let's start on the domestics of the positive news first. Yeah, Kiko, what's positive news here is that although McDonald's, those Starbucks does not have a jingle like McDonald's Starbucks and Wall Street are certainly singing to the tune of this fiscal fourth quarter report Wall Street. Here today Starbucks having the best day since May shares up nearly 10% in two hours into trading day here. Now, as you noted here, despite them setting higher prices in Q3, they did give us a bit of an estimate there that they raised them a 5% over the past 12 months. But that actually did lead to higher revenue here, record $8.4 billion. Here in the US, seems to be sales jumped by 11%. Thanks to a 10% increase in average ticket price. But just how long will that momentum continue? And can customers expect another price hike? Starbucks, if a Rachel's Ariel, wait in this morning with Yahoo Finance. Really in response to inflationary pressures. We'll have some of that this year based on annualization from moves we made last year. But we expect our pricing to return to actions that are more on a historical level. What we focus on is really how do we sustain that ticket? Because it isn't just pricing. It's actually volume as well. We've seen our customers purchase more. That's evidence didn't you in a tax increase to tax. So we're seeing increased volume. Now some of those offerings of what they consider that are driving volumes include customization here about 60% of beverages are now customized. Modifiers have grown in double digits. And that's includes stuff like pumpkin spice syrup or pepper mocha. Serbs going into your coffee. But Rachel continued to emphasize is that the partners and as you noted, labor inflation certainly coming into consideration here driving this demand that Starbucks is willing to fill also Rachel emphasized that they continue to believe that aside by side relationship with partners is most important in this organization efforts continuum. Side note, Brooke, it looks like you and Rachel are wearing the same top. I didn't know yet. I don't have the same color. I was going to give her drink. They played were doing. We were talking about China because we did see a double digit decline in same source sales there. There's been some rumors floating around this week that potentially China could ease at zero. COVID policy. What more did we hear from Starbucks about what that's likely to mean for their second largest market? Yeah. Well, like so many US consumer brands, Starbucks is certainly hoping and weighing and ultimately, you know, super bullish on the fact that this COVID-19 zero policy will be lifted soon. Starbucks really taking a leader position here, ultimately weighing in and continuing to grow. Now there's nearly 6,000 stores opening up in China and Rachel emphasized that they're actually moving towards digital there in the midst of mobility, not being back to where it was pre pandemic. She said that 44% of the overall sales are digital now. And then once mobility lifts, they expect those stores to operate and continue to grow. Howard Schultz also see where opposite the key are he strongly believes that they will come out of this pandemic as the number one Western consumer brand. So certainly something that's keeping eye on and will continue to follow how exactly that performs on Wall Street. Yeah, certainly been a key market for Starbucks for a very long time. Brooke, thanks so much for that. Let's give the conversation going on Starbucks. We've got Sarah Senator, Bank of America, Senior Restaurant Analyst. Sarah, let me just start with your takeaways from the numbers that we got. A bit of a mixed result. I mean, positive things are moving in the right direction, but still some headwinds abroad. Yeah, I would say more positive than negative. So from the perspective of the US, you know, certainly one of the, if not the best, same store sales numbers, we've seen come out of the earnings season this quarter. The fact that they had 10 points of check is certainly a reflection on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,72,2022-11-04 18:52:44
4885," 10 points of check is certainly a reflection on, you know, as earlier we said, people adding food, people customizing, but also, you know, they said they did have positive transactions, which is a real rarity in this operating environment right now. So that combination was really, I think, very unique and a testament to how strong the brand is and the affinity that customers have, you know, outside of the US, very, very strong results with the exception of course of China, where we know lockdowns led to really intense mobility constraints. But even there, the same source sales were better than people had anticipated. So really recovering very nicely when some of these restrictions are lifted. And again, I think a reflection of how strong the brand is and the ability start of access to connect with consumers in that market and is well positioned as when the lockdown restrictions ultimately are lifted. You know, Starbucks are only not unique in raising some of their prices. We have seen so many food restaurants, you know, really try to make up for the additional costs they're having to pay for. But I wonder how much more pricing power you think Starbucks has? Well, I think you make a very good point there, which is that Starbucks is not unique. And in fact, Starbucks has actually taken less price or, you know, smaller price increases your rear than most in the industry. So if you look at the, you know, consumer price index for food away from home, which is restaurants, you see that that's up, you know, eight, nine percent. I think about seven and a half, eight percent year to date more recently. If you look at some of the other restaurants in the industry who have reported six, five, six percent, which is what Starbucks says on their menu, it was actually very low end of the range. So typically we're hearing prices more in the eight percent range McDonald's to 10 to put laid took about 11 and a half on their menu. So to have six percent price increase year-to-year really is exceptional, but only in the sense that it's lower than what you're seeing at most other restaurants. And finally, Sarah, I want to get back to the point you made about China. I mean, certainly the expectation seems to be that if there is some softening on a zero COVID policy activity, pick up people go back into stores, you know, these are all positives, especially for retailers like Starbucks, but we're also looking at some significant downturn in terms of the economy, in terms of the broader growth that we're seeing unemployment higher in the second largest market there. I mean, what's a realistic expectation about how much Starbucks can return to to what extent Starbucks can return to pre pandemic levels in China? Well, I think, you know, a couple things one is just in terms of thinking about the pace of growth that Starbucks has in China, big part of it has been new unit growth. So same store sales will certainly prior to COVID were healthy in that kind of three to four percent range, but really the big driver of growth and a value creation for Starbucks and for Chinese consumers has been opening of new restaurants. So, you know, the expectations that they can continue to do that at a low double digit pace, certainly if you look at the store base, you know, it's roughly 6,000 that compares to the US of over 14 or 15,000. So, you know, think about the relative size of the population. It certainly would seem to suggest that they're targeted about 9,000 stores in China's eminently achievable. So, I don't see reason to think that that universe has to slow. To your point, you know, Starbucks is very cognizant of the economic pressures facing the country, but I think, you know, what they have done so well in the last few years is really adapt their loyalty program and make sure that they can really speak directly to customers one to one, which I think is very important at all times, but certainly as consumers are thinking about their budget, as they're thinking about where they want to spend their discretionary dollars. Sarah Seneswar, Bank of America, Senior Restaurants Analysts, it's good to talk to you today, really appreciate the time. Well, coming up thousands of Twitter employees to be losing their jobs today, I'm already a lawsuit in the works on the back of that. We're going to tell you about it after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,73,2022-11-04 18:57:03

4887," time as we enter the final down up just under 200 po buying action over the last or so to you look at the s positive territory still you can see well off its just around 7 tens of a at the nasak 100 that is for the day at least on look at some of the other let's take a look on a w basis here nasak for the ready to concede off just as door dash comes up let the major averages here the week in the red and the Dow and the SMP you around 2% over the past also in the red off just as well taking a look at that we're seeing play on an intraday basis you financials as the leaders the only sector trading on a five day basis the leader there up just a look at some of the we mentioned the fact taking a sharp hit on s services and technology in the market today and inside the Dow a bit of past five days but on int looking at Microsoft hold Morgan in the green honey pushing to the upside to the market and we're trying to hold on to that good news you can call it in the jobs report the market is looking at it as good news at 3.7% unemployment rate which was a bit higher than what we got in the last reading the markets a bit encouraged by that is the sign that maybe potentially the Fed will not be as hawkish as they have been anticipating sets the big driver in today's markets for sure. All right but I also want to get you up to speed on what is happening with oil and China will connect those dots for you just a second of the day. I'm going to take a look at what we're seeing with WTI and crude receiving that it's up more than 5% here that's rallying to a three week high also Brent crude there up about four and a third of a percent now we've got a few factors of play we have G7 countries agreeing on a price capping mechanism on Russian crude you also have the US dollar losing some strength on use on some news that on that news and also China the world's biggest crude import to reportedly planning to scrap a policy that's penalizing airlines based on co-vid cases brought into the country and of course any rumor or sign of a potential easing of China's zero-covid policy that's also trickling over to China's ADR so we're going to hop over this we can see how the Chinese stocks are doing today and as we can see here you have some of the bigger players you have bar by here rallying more than five and a half percent you have been world are there up more than nine percent JD dot com there up almost nine percent as well and we're also seeing the EVs look at neo they're up more than 15 percent on the day and we also have the auto that's up more than 7 percent on the day and trip.com as you can see over here up more than 5 percent on the day as well. All right well the top story for markets today as China was just discussing the jobs report and the labor market showing signs of resiliency but there could be some concerns on the horizon. How employers adding 261,000 jobs last month thousands more than expected and employment rising slightly to 3.7 percent when Michelle Gerard had a US net West global economics joins us now to break down those numbers so obviously this is just one of the metrics that the Fed watches what are your big takeaways from this job state. I think stepping back even with the next messages you have to conclude that the labor market is holding up pretty well in the face of what has been I think aggressive action from the Federal Reserve to date I think it suggests that the Fed has more to do with the federal government. The Fed has been signaling that since on Wednesday the Fed has signaled that alongside the 75 basis point rate increase that rates were going to continue to rise they might rise slower going forward but that the Fed was believing that interest rates were ultimately that it had higher than they had thought maybe even a month ago. So I think this is this report is consistent with the Fed thinking that it's too early to think about in the Rehijk cycle. Michelle, it certainly does seem like that but it's interesting when you take a look 10 numbers about the cert你說 5 but it's about Welding mayor. flakes 10",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,75,2022-11-04 19:06:15
4888," the feds thinking that it's too early to think about a stop in the rate high cycle. Michelle certainly does seem like that but it's interesting when you take a look at the markets reaction we were up almost 600 points at the highs of the session of course we're pretty far off those highs but when you take a look I guess at any signs of weakness you mentioned the unemployment rate 3.7% just what is that signal to you I guess maybe is potentially the labor market finally slowing down. Well there may be some hands as you said the unemployment rate moved higher and moved up as employment as measured by the household survey actually declined so when the Bureau of Labor Services calls households and asked them if they're working as opposed to looking at what employers say they found actually far fewer people working than than the month before and you know maybe that's a sign of some of some easing although that number is so volatile month to month you know I think when you look at the hourly earnings number you know that number came down on a year-over your basis maybe that has speak there's some other signs that perhaps wage pressures are beginning to ease ever so slightly. To me that is really something that would be such a welcome development for the fed to see if there is some cooling on wage pressures then I think that would begin to begin to get the fed to feel a bit more comfortable or confident that in fact as we look ahead to 2023 inflation can indeed begin to move sustainably lower. And Michelle what about the quality of jobs that are still on the table because that seems to be an issue some of these lower-paid jobs still a lot of openings obviously they were the hardest hit during the peak of the pandemic. You were still seeing a very high number of job openings now I will say in this month's report the job gains were fairly broad-based and you did give a big gain in manufacturing which tends to be higher paid but you also as always saw a big increase in service employment up to 100,000 and you know and there you did see kind of some split in terms of some of the lower wage categories but it was it was a bit evenly more dispersed. The truth is a lot of the demand for labor in those lower paid industries it's just still very difficult to find workers as you said those sectors were hard hit during the pandemic a lot of individuals left those jobs and they they've gone out they've upscaled themselves they've educated themselves they're not looking to go back to those lower earning wages and as a result you're seeing still a real difficulty I think for employers to define and actually hire those workers of workers into those jobs. So Michelle going back to what you were saying just a few minutes ago about what the signals for the Fed you basically were saying that it kind of reinforces the current path of rate hikes that the Fed had been on but when it comes to that next meeting and there's a number of data points I know between now and the December meeting but what do you think is most likely on the table could we get another 75 basis point hike. We could but as you said there are a couple of very important inflation reports that that will be due out our feeling is the inflation numbers may show ever so slightly some pooling and that combined with the fact that Fed has already done a great deal we think they will come down on the side of moving a bit more slowly so we expect a 50 basis point hike but I think importantly whereas many perhaps had thought that would be it and the Fed would cause in 2023 we had all long thought we'd still see a couple of additional smaller rate hikes in the first half of next year and I think the comments and the data the policy has gotten from the Fed and the data suggests that that the rate hiking cycle is indeed likely still over so we may get 50 basis points in December but again a couple of further fractions in the first half of 2023. And Michelle what are you watching outside of what the Fed can do obviously we've heard a lot about hiring freezes and layoffs but we still see this very strong job market what is the fact as outside of the Fed's control that you're watching well I mean in general I think you know for the Fed there's the question is just what you know how how much will these slow down in economic",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,76,2022-11-04 19:10:10
4889," Well, I mean, in general, I think, you know, for the Fed, there's the question is just what, you know, how, how much will the slowdown and economic activity actually bring inflation lower? So, you know, I think that is the, that's the question. We may see weak economic data. We may see the demand for labor, fall. We may see job openings begin to pull back. It's not quite evident yet. But even if the economy slows, we've got to see some evidence that that will transmit into lower inflation. And I think that that will happen. And so I'm just watching for signs ultimately, the, the turn in terms of the market, the turn for the Federal Reserve being able to fall up peak in the rate hiking cycle, it all, all roads lead back to when does inflation peak and begin to move sustainably lower. And so keeping an eye on all of that, and I think you've got to look at more than just the, you know, how strong the economy or weak the economy is because that may not be back into, you know, we could go with may not be back into lower inflation. I think keeping an eye on any signs of inflation or wage pressures moving lower is ultimately going to be the key for market and for their and, and for Fed action. All right. Well, we do thank you for joining us, Michelle Gerard. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Thank you. This afternoon. All right. Well, we're just getting started here when you're finally it's live coming up. Elon Musk says Twitter is facing a quote, massive drop in revenue. Who he's blaming. Plus, Twilio shares plunging on wheat guidance. The company's COO of Twilio joins us to explain what he thinks the market is getting wrong. And mixed moves in the payment space, paypal shares under pressure, but it's a strong date for block and we have an analyst who's bullish on both. We'll take a closer look. Don't go anywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,77,2022-11-04 19:14:51
4890," Elon Musk says Twitter is suffering from a, quote, massive drop in revenue. Now, the finance says Dan Howley joins us now with the details. So Dan, was this expected? It kind of isn't just the way, you know, that the tweet was kind of unexpected, but the moves that we've seen kind of were expected. So the main tweet that Elon sent out is Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups, pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation, and we did everything we could to appease the activists. Extremely messed up, they're trying to destroy free speech in America. Now, I mean, it's free speech for a company to decide whether it wants to advertise with Twitter or not. So, you know, it cuts both ways. But what he's referring to is the number of companies that are stepping back, pausing, or at least putting on hold their advertising campaigns on Twitter. That includes the likes of GM, General Mills, Pfizer, Volkswagen. We had Mondalees also putting their advertising campaigns on hold. And really what this comes down to is just the fact that they're not entirely sure what's going to happen at Twitter. Elon Musk has gutted the C-suite, gotten rid of the board, fired numerous employees today, and you know, we're still not exactly certain what he's going to be doing with Twitter. Now, he has released previous statements saying that he doesn't want the company to turn into a essentially lawless hellscape. He has said that he wants it to be warm and welcoming, and that they will work with advertisers. They also spoke to members of civil rights groups who were concerned about the potential for a hate speech to take over on Twitter because Elon Musk has said that he wants to see fewer or relaxed moderation there. And so I think what's going on here is these companies are essentially saying, look, we're just hedging our bets on whether or not Twitter is going to be a good place for our products to be displayed as parts of ads. They don't necessarily want things like Oreos showing up next to some kind of insane tirade. So it makes sense for these companies, and Elon Musk is obviously bothered by that. And so he's saying that it's essentially some kind of larger activist campaign when it could simply be companies doing their due diligence. It is certainly a challenging time here for Twitter. You could also say that about the broader tech space. I also want to talk to you though about what we're seeing play out in gaming because it's an industry that's clearly been under pressure just this week, EA lowering its expectations in terms of guidance. Part of that due to the slowdown that we've seen in gaming. Is that going to turn around any time soon? Yeah, it's unlikely. The holiday season is generally the best time for gaming sales. And you know, you might expect that it would be able to raise the prospects for gaming this year just based on the fact that that's when so many people go out and buy. But it's been hit so much from the drops that we've seen due to the comparisons to the pandemic era that it's unlikely that we're going to see those shoot up anytime soon. There's also just a lack of high quality titles that are expected for the holidays or that are coming out for the holidays. There's two standouts right now or three standouts. There's God of War, Ragnarok and the Clistol Protocol. Those are still coming. We did see Call of Duty come out. We had FIFA come out, both of those games, FIFA and Call of Duty had huge numbers of players so there is an appetite there for games. It's just that there aren't enough for people to get excited about and purchase. All right, Dan Halle. Thanks. As always, of course, we will keep tracking that. We'll talk a little bit more about gaming here in just a few minutes. But first, let's take a look at the broader tech space because tech stocks have taken a beating in recent weeks amid an advertising slump and higher rates. And a number of those companies in the sector announcing layoffs and hiring freezes. So here to discuss all of that as well as what lies ahead for the tech media industry. We want to bring in Michael Wolfe, activate consulting founder and CEO. Michael, it's great to have you here. So let's take a step back and talk about some of the ad trends that we're seeing play out in the sector. We're just talking to Dan about what's going on specifically at Twitter. And that's a bit of a different story. The more we're seeing play out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,78,2022-11-04 19:18:54
4891," Let's take a step back and talk about some of the ad trends that we're seeing play out in the sector. We're just talking to Dan about what's going on specifically at Twitter and that's a bit of a different story. The more we're seeing play out in some of the other names in this space. We heard from meta, alphabet, snap, all suffering from a slowdown in advertising spending. What you're take away from what we're seeing there. Advertisers are looking for a couple of things. One is they're looking for performance. Are they going to get sales? The second thing they're looking for is momentum. Is there going to be more consumer revenue? The third is they're looking for safety, which is this is the issue with Twitter. Some of it is and a lot of these the performance is going down and so Facebook is less effective and so you can see and others. Google the cost of the keywords is going up. Performance is not great. Momentum, if you look at some of the major sites, their engagement is going down and so it's not as if the overall sector and part of what's also driving these big layoffs is there's that online never let a good crisis go to waste. All of these companies have got been bloated lots of staff that they need and this is a good excuse for them to lower the number of staff members. You'll notice they're not selling engine. They're not they're not firing engineers and they're not firing developers because those are the people that they need the most. Michael, this is Rochelle here. In terms of where they're placing these ads, we saw that when Netflix announced that it was having its tiered model, we saw a lot of advertisers pouring into that. Is that where you see more of the future of this going more towards the streaming space? The streaming space it's going to be there's no doubt there's going to be a lot of growth and advertising. The streaming services when you put ads there it's it's really in a lot of ways it's a good substitute for TV. It has some limitations. It's not going to just be Netflix and it's going to be all of the different streaming services are going to launch an ad tier. If you look at peacock that's from NBC Universal that's already gaining a lot of advertising. So obviously video advertising is the most important for selling a lot of things and I think that that's going to continue to grow. Michael, when you take a look at some of the other trends outside of advertising, we've seen Meta really suffer because they haven't been able to sell this whole Metaverse movement to the masses or at least to Wall Street. You can obviously if you take a look at the performance of the stock year today. Is that more of a meta specific story? And what do you think is maybe the bigger story going on with the Metaverse here? It's first of all the term Metaverse is one that now is cringeworthy but and it's been a massive hype cycle but there's a number of reasons why this is real. One of the mis you have 300 million people that are ready in what are Metaverse environments between Roblox Minecraft Fortnite. You have people who are living in these virtual worlds and they're doing a lot of the things that are important for them to be in a metaverse. In terms of Meta, well a lot the entire bet is on headsets and it's on VR and we don't believe our firm activate we don't necessarily believe that this is going to be VR. Most people can't be in VR for more than about a half an hour and all of those games they're 2D experiences today so it really comes down to a 1500 dollar headset is very expensive for most consumers to pay. And Michael I want to ask you since you're talking about a gaming the global video gaming market. Now you expect it to grow to nearly 222 billion by 2026. Talk about what are going to be the real growth drivers there and where you see that as you mentioned things like like VR on the Metaverse as well. Well one of the growth drivers is this is a hit driven business and so we're going to continue to see franchises, established franchises, releasing new games. That's one of the things. I think also we're going to see a lot more gamers. Gaming has been very attractive for women. You see a lot of different groups of people coming in. You also see it isn't just mobile games. You see a lot more people having access to high speed internet so those games are wired and they're and they're already multiplayer games. So it's an activity that's going to continue to grow and it's just taking a bigger piece of people's entertainment and technology time. And Michael we've already seen some consolidation within the gaming industry but do you think we'll likely see more in the years ahead? We think that there's going to be more consolidation. In fact what we believe is all of the major technology companies are going",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,79,2022-11-04 19:23:11
4892," likely see more in the years ahead? We think that there's going to be more consolidation. In fact, what we believe is all of the major technology companies are going to end up buying the game companies. And we saw this begin this year with Microsoft Buying Activision. But if they're all going to be in the gaming business, if they're all going to be moving towards interactive worlds like Metaverse, they're going to need to own gaming companies. And if you look at the value of most of the gaming companies, they're worth about a day's volatility in most of these other stocks. So it's obvious to us that this is where it's going to go. And the ones that are most attractive within that space, I guess, how are you trying to parse through and identify the winners or losers? Because what we just heard from Dan is that I guess they don't all stock up as even at this point. Well, they're not even the, it's the franchises that matter. And so they need to decide, usually, yes, the last quarter of the years where there's a lot of activity. And let's be clear, part of this is driven by just releases of game titles. And so it comes down to when each company is going to release a game title. When they release a new title, it's unbelievable. I mean, you had the last red dead redemption. It was released. It was almost $1 billion in the first weekend. So this will come down to when they release and what they release. And Michael, I know, obviously, Twitter gets a lot of headlines at the moment when it comes to social media. But obviously, when you talk social media, you have to talk about TikTok. A lot of growth, still a lot of growth potential here. But obviously, US regulators really starting to crack down on TikTok as well. How do you see social media use growing? And what do you see as the biggest headwinds for the industry? TikTok is a disruptive force, not just in social media, but across all technology and media. So if you look at the amount of time that the average TikTok user is based on our research, in some cases, it's over an hour a day. It's becoming a good alternative to search. There are a lot of people who are, when they go to a search, then instead of going to Google, they're going to TikTok. And of course, media is replacing a lot of the longer forms of video. It's hard, given the popularity of this, it's a huge mistake for the government to try to regulate it. What ends up happening is when you don't allow people to have a legitimate reason to access something in technology and media, they find it a illicit way of doing it. So it'll be a huge mistake, and it's hard to enforce. It's certainly be interesting to watch out all plays out. Michael, if you're great to have, you think so much to join us in studio. Great to be here. Coming up, investors, don't see drop kings as a winning bet at least today. Shares plunging. Look at that. Just around 27%.

4893," in It's time for Triple Play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We have Atlassian, draft kings, Adidas, or Adidas. For that we'll have Jeravlick rejoining us. I'll start with my pick, which is Atlassian Corporation, Tick a Team, TEAM, TEAM. The stock in the software design and project management hosting company plunged into two year lows. You can see that down about 30% on the day after reporting fiscal 1st quarter 2023 financial results. 7 years of 807 million was a touch higher than expected, a profit of an adjusted basis of 36 cents a share. That felt slightly short, but it was the slowdown in the conversion of free users to paid plans becoming more pronounced that investors really seemed to hone in on. Now existing paid users are also slowing as companies as we've been reporting a tightening their purse strings in this current macroeconomic environment. That followed a raft of price cuts, including from Mitsuho, $255 a share from 320, from Baird, 210 a share from 380 from Goldman Sachs, 265 a share from 300. So obviously a sharp reaction there and the stock continuing to be under pressure this afternoon. And Michelle, I actually got downgraded by McQuerry, downgraded to neutral. They cut their purse target to 147 from 287. So so higher from where it is today, but you can really show just by those revisions how bearish Wall Street is getting on this day. We can take a look at today's drop. It's just off the lows of the day, but we could be looking at the worst day on record for this stock. We do see losses of just over 30%. But certainly a very uncertain and tough macroeconomic environment. We're seeing that effect the name there. My pick today is draft King shares plunging after its latest earnings report showing that sports betting a user growth has slowed the company posted a 22% gain in users, but that was down from 30% in the prior quarter. And the draft King's is under pressure from Wall Street to become a profitable, which is CEO Jason Robbins says that he still thinks is possible by the fourth quarter of next year on the earnings call. Robbins also discussed spending and a shift from local to national ads as the company expands in more states. Jared, we've seen more and more states legalized sports betting yet we haven't really seen that reflected in draft King's stock. We're looking at massive losses today. And for the year, this stock really has been under pressure. Mike, we were just talking the break shone that any time it seems like every day we have a handful of stocks, which are just plummeting. Let's pull up the Wi-Fi interactive and I can show you we are now back down to what was support in the earlier part of the year. This is a year-to-day chart, down 58%. But let me show you a max chart because as we are all discussing, this was a spack way back in the day. It came to market at $10 a share and guess what? It is almost at right back at that price here. It's another one of those pandemic, I guess, source sports right now. So let's get back to the main point here because I am looking at something that is up today and this is the European Sports Apparel Juggernaut Adidas, up about 25% and having some of its best day since 2005. And this is on the news that it's in talk with the outgoing Puma CEO, Bjorn Gouldin, to take over from current CEO, Casper Vorsted. Now, Gouldin is leaving Puma at the end of the year already amid record profits and sales. Yet the stocks of both Adidas and Puma, numbers 2 and 3 in the athletic sector, are both considerably down this year. Though Adidas is off a bit more, perhaps due to its controversial relationship with Yay, which it recently terminated. Now, I want to go back to the Wi-Fi Interactive and just show you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,81,2022-11-04 19:32:02
4894," This year, though, a deed is off a bit more, perhaps due to its controversial relationship with Yeh, which it recently terminated. Now, I want to go back to the Wi-Fi interactive and just show you a comparison chart. This is a deed as versus Puma. I said they were neck and neck, both down about 60% on the year. Although if you take a look at the last three years, it is favoring Puma a bit there, Shana. Yeah, it certainly is. When you take a look at a deed as the company needed to do something to turn things around at least, that was the message that we're getting from Wall Street. Adidas had really been under fire most recently because of the partnership with Kanye. So it'll be interesting to see how this new CEO approaches maybe future partnerships like this here, Rochelle. Yeah, we know that Adidas also teamed up with British Rapper Stormsie. Hopefully that will end a little bit better than the collaboration with Kanye for sure. Yeah, it's certainly Wall Street. Pretty excited about this move today. Coming up, Dr. Fauci, saying that the US is at a pandemic crossroads. Find out what's concerning the White House of Chief and Medical Advisor most as we approach the Winter Month's next. Thank you. It's been buying things. It's been a wild day for the markets on the heels of the October jobs report. You can see gains across the board down now up 312 points was up just around 600 points at the highs of the session. Also holding on to gains as well as a NASDAQ investors encouraged by the uptick that we saw in the unemployment report. So we need to talk about how the equity market is looking at this and what this convene for the last couple of months of the year. We want to bring in Julian and Manuel Everkore, ISI, Senior Managing Director and Julian. It's great to see you. So I guess just your takeaway from the jobs report and kind of the wild action that we've seen play out in the market today. It's a really extraordinary day in every respect.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,82,2022-11-04 19:36:27
4895," So I guess just your takeaway from the jobs report and kind of the wild action that we've seen play out in the market today. Really an extraordinary day in every respect. And I think that if you had asked most investors how the market would react, given today's numbers, they would have said a strong rally would have been last on their list of outcomes. For us, this is a process. It's not that the market's getting comfortable with where the Fed needs to go. That's going to be difficult to play out. But what we've really seen was a geopolitical boost here that is helping to turn sentiment. And we think kick off the next leg of this bear market rally. The news out of China really quite good that they're going to advance the dialogue. At some point over the weekend towards the zero COVID eventual reopening. And then she's comment about not wanting to see any sort of nuclear weaponry used in Europe really, really helps at the margin to do some de-risking to the European situation. Very positive. Yeah, so Julie, when you take a look at that, the fact that you see that this could potentially be the next leg of the bear market rally. How high do you think we could potentially hit? So basically when we've done a lot of work on what bear market rallies tend to look like. Now the starting point for this one at the trough on October 13 was down 27.5%. When you get a bear market rally starting from that deep a selloff, the average tends to be up around 17.5% from that level. So this rally could carry all the way to 4,000, but there's another added aspect to it. Is that the seasonality, not only the fourth quarter, but the tendency for stocks to do well after the midterms and into the following year is very, very strong. So then, Julie, in terms of the minds that you should have, if you have a shorter investing time horizon versus a longer one, how should you be approaching the markets right now? Well, if you have a shorter time horizon, you really, really need to trade smaller positions, give them a lot more leeway. And from our point of view, this is a situation where you want to be selective buyers of value type stocks. We've seen a lot of pain in the growth space over the last couple weeks. The earnings season has not been kind in general to fang, but value stocks in a high inflation environment and a high interest rate environment tend to do well. They've outperformed this year. We think that continues to be the trend. And as you look at the rest of the earnings season, what are some of the bell weather companies that you're going to be keeping on that will really give you a gauge of how you think the economy is fairing or at least how investors think the economy is fairing? Right. We really seen the majority of reports. And this is one of these seasons, not unlike the season in July, where you don't really want to say this stock means this to the economy. Because frankly, the story from an economy wide perspective has been extremely complex. What is interesting and notable for us, though, when you think about the regression of this earnings season is that we got the downgrades to earnings expectations that we thought we would get. In fact, bottoms up consensus is still about six to seven percent above where our next year estimate is. But recently the last several days, those earnings downgrades have started to flatten out. And that alone, regardless of the kind of commentary you're here, you'll hear in the last couple of weeks from the tag ends of reports is likely to support equities. All right. We're always great to get your insights. Evercore, ISI, Senior Managing Director, Julian Immanuel. Thank you so much for joining us. Have a great week. Thank you. All right. Coming up, a storm is brewing in the cloud. First, it was Microsoft and Amazon and concerns now rocking shares of Twilio losing a third of their value today. The company COO joins us next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,83,2022-11-04 19:40:26
4896," And concerns now rockenshers of Twilio, losing a third of their value today. The company COO joins us next. Shares of Twilio plummeting after the communications software maker issued fourth quarter revenue guidance below estimates and posted a loss of 27 cents per share during the third quarter. The company had more than 280,000 active customer accounts at the end of Q3 up 5,000 from the previous quarter. We joined by a Cozema Shipchannel at Twilio's COO. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. As we're seeing the stock really under pressure today, what do you think investors are perhaps not getting about this whole picture? Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me. It certainly is a little bit of a humbling day with respect to the stock price. But I think look, the financial framework for the company going forward is actually quite good. It's a tough macro backdrop. No question about that. But as we look at our financial results, we put up a really strong Q3 in a tough macroeconomic environment. We did take down some of our guidance for Q4 and provided a medium term range on the revenue side that was 15 to 25 percent up over the next three to five years. That's how we kind of defined it. And we committed to being a profitable company over that time frame as well. So I certainly understand that there are some macro dynamics here and potentially some dynamics that investors are playing in a wait and see fashion. But we feel really good about the setup of the company and feel really good about the products and customers that we've got. Cozema, when you take a look at the performance in this stock today, obviously Wall Street a little bit concerned about some of the macro headwinds not only facing Twilio, but more so this sector at large, are you seeing, I guess, any delayed purchase decisions or longer sales cycles as a result? And you potentially seeing those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,84,2022-11-04 19:45:04
4897," It's making the rise of businesses are becoming a big win in the early year. I think it's really wild and thick, but this sector at large are you seeing any delayed purchase decisions or long sales so as a result and you potentially see those had. Where's here over the next quarter or two? –I guess it's hard to imagine them getting too much worse but we are definitely seeing some sector impacts, not surprisingly. we're seeing things So I think those are all sectors in which we've seen some impacts across the board. I can imagine that you'll see some additional reports come out from various companies, particularly around CPG and retail over the coming months. But we think we've largely baked that stuff in into our guidance. And so we feel pretty good about the setup of our company. And again, I think we feel like we're going to be profitable irrespective of the environment. And we think it's a good setup for investors going forward, in spite of the correction that occurred today. And in Bank of America's note, I mean, they were complementary about the analyst state that they had presenting it as an opportunity to reset expectations and talking about the shift in focus from growth to delivering meaningful operating profits. What is the strategy there? Well, we always want to be a growth company, right? I mean, we were a technology company. We're of such a vintage that we think we can continue delivering high growth rates for a long period of time. And at our scale, we're growing 15 to 25% as about a $4 billion company, which I think is quite impressive. That said, I think we should also reap the economies of scale that come with being a large company. We don't just want to be a big company. We want to be a really great company. And I think part of that is being really profitable. So we committed to being profitable in 2023 on a non-gap basis. We will accomplish that. And then thereafter, we also committed to ongoing op-margin accretion, which we have good plans to deliver. We'll generate leverage across most of our cost categories. And I think our software products will really start picking up as well. And we've got some really exciting stuff in the pipeline between Flex, our contact center product, and then segment and engage on the data side. And speaking of costs there, you're coming in announcing layoffs, 11% of the workers back in September. When you look ahead here, do you see the need to potentially, I guess, insert some more cost-cutting measures as you do remain focused on profitability next year? Yeah, I don't see that today. I think that it's a fair question. But based on the plan that we put together, we came up with a variety of scenarios that we could imagine, some of which are relatively dire, in fact. And so we feel pretty good about what we did. I think we'd been thinking about right sizing the workforce for a while. I think we got a little bit ahead of ourselves in terms of what happened during COVID, vis-a-vis hiring. It's unfortunate, really difficult decision, obviously. But I think it was appropriate and the right thing for us to do to set up the long term of the company. Going forward, I wouldn't take anything off the table ever, obviously. But we feel pretty good about the setup right now, and I don't see us having to do anything further currently. And some of the key partners of Twilio that Bank of America survey talked about the competitive pricing pressure that might intensify, intensify, because Twilio does have a premium pricing on it. Are there any plans to perhaps adjust pricing given what the competition is doing and given the macroeconomic background? No, not right now. I mean, honestly, we feel pretty good about the competitive dynamic. We feel pretty good about the way that we're priced. We do feel like we offer a premium technology offering. And yeah, there's a higher price that goes with that, but I think it's also a better product. And we have different products and different competitive sets based on the way that those things shake out. We're different in data, we're different in marketing, we're different in context center. And then again, a little bit different competitive set in communications. But in each of those, we command a price premium. We feel like we deserve that, and we feel like the technology is superior to the competitors. Well, Kuzama, we really appreciate you coming on today, especially given that such a tough day when you take a look at the stock price off just around 35% we hope to have you back. Kuzama, Ship Chandler, Twilio's COO. Great. Thanks for having me. Well, the CDC saying today at a media briefing that the flu and respiratory viruses are hitting much harder and earlier than in the past. Angelic Hamlani joins us now with more on this. And I guess Andrew already been.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,85,2022-11-04 19:49:35
4898," ED are briefing that the flu and respiratory viruses are hitting much harder and earlier than in the past. Angelique Imlani joins us now with more on this. And I guess Andriv already, I guess, heard the warnings that hospitals are beginning to overfill, but what else could we potentially see now over the next couple of months? Well, we're definitely potentially going to be seeing COVID still. That's still on the horizon and plays into that threat of the triple-demic, tri-demic, you know, triple threat, whatever you want to call it. We know that Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, was talking about this in a radio interview recently and stressing the fact that the country is not really at a good place when it comes to finding the virus. We're still at more than 400 deaths per day. We're still in the thousands and tens of thousands of cases per day. And that is still leading the world, so not a good place at all. And with winter variants or new variants on the horizon, that is potentially going to be a fair worse. We know that we've been following the BQ-1, BQ-1, one variants. And they now combined makeup 35 percent. That's an increase from the last time we discussed this. It was 27 percent before the CDC now saying it accounts for 35 percent of cases. But now looking at RSV and flu, that is already stressing really the East Coast right now, the Minutelanic, New England, Washington area, currently experiencing significant capacity strains according to the CDC. And they're expecting that this will move through in waves, hitting other parts of the U.S. similar to the way that COVID did in the past years. Now, what's important about noting the RSV and flu early season, it's really an early and strong season for both in flu specifically, the highest level of hospitalizations that they've seen at this point in time in the year in over a decade. So that's where some of the concern is coming from. And clear whether or not it will be a quick rise and plateau or if it will be a sustained surge of cases around the country, that's something that the CDC officials were unable to really pin down. But that's sort of where things stand. And we heard from specifically CDC's Dr. Jose Romero saying that previous years, eight-typical seasons due to mitigation against COVID left a large swath of the U.S. population and uninfected, so children need to be infected and essentially to get passed in now. And the masking that was taking place before helped to keep all this at bay in the past few years. And, Angela, understand that Pfizer's released some new data on Omicron boosters. What can you tell us about that? That's right. As anticipated, we know that their updated booster by valent booster has been effective and is supposed to be more effective. And in fact, then the initial strain, which is why administration officials have stopped offering the original vaccine and are pushing the updated by valent booster, a new data out today, saying that it was four times more effective for older individuals, which is really the target of this new shot. So after a month, they're seeing a really good protection levels as anticipated. Sorry, I'm going to be some encouraging news area. Angela Kimlani, thanks so much. We're coming up returning a purchase or a gift that you don't need may become more costly. Find out why next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,86,2022-11-04 19:53:42
4899," How to würde choose Shoppers beware retailers are rethinking their return policies ahead of the holiday shopping season. More businesses can't seem to afford these returns, adding a significant burden to retailers' storage challenge. So what do you think, Sean? How much do you think this is going to discourage consumers from returning to stores? Because I know the free shipping button is something, but knowing that I might have an issue with returns, especially for the holidays, that's asking a lot, I think. Yeah, I think it's huge. I was actually a recent survey out showing that consumers, 98% consumers, say that free shipping is the most important consideration when they're buying online, and that also goes for free returns as well. So I think so many people are used to what's happened over the last two and a half years during the pandemic. They've been able to extend that return window or have been able to return their online purchases for free. So I think this could potentially really impact sales at specific stores. We've already seen a number of stores short in their return window gap. O'Neary, Jay, crew are among them now. There are a little bit of different rules as we lead up to the holiday shopping season. We certainly have seen retailers become a little bit more lenient over the next two or three months. But the fees, I think, to return items. I know Anthropology, LLB, cost about $6 return item. And I think that that is enough to maybe, I guess, discourage some people from buying from those stores. That's true, because I mean, when you think of Nordstrom, one of the things that they're known for is having this obviously very flexible return policy, and they haven't waived on that even during the pandemic. But I think when at a time when people have less discretionary income and it takes that much little to sort of put you off, if you know you might end up paying a fee, not just for something you bought for yourself, but potentially for one of, you know, for someone you're giving a gift to, for me, that's going to make me think twice and definitely read the small print before I hit buy on the button for sure. Alright, we'll leave that there, but coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street, stick with us here on your finance life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,87,2022-11-04 19:58:10
4900," o Just about 90 seconds to go until the closing bell still looking at gains across the board in adjusting performance how did And some of the rate sensitive stocks, the I growth names, those have gotten hit this week. On the sector action on a daily chart, you'll see materials, financials, technology, leading. But a five day chart shows you communication services technology, consumer discretionary. Those were the losers for the week. And keeping it on that five day chart, you can see the NASDAQ 100, Apple down 11% over the last five days, Amazon down 12%. Here's the closing bell for today, Friday, November 4th. MUSIC And now you have it ending this first week of November in the green to the major indices. Let's take a deeper dive here. We see the down there up about 400 points there, though pairing back some of the gains of the day, the S&P 500 there, of about 50 points there, one and a third of a percent of the tech of the NASDAQ, up about one and a third of a percent. They're all three up for the day, but down for the week. Well, let's take a closer look at the broader markets. Let's bring in our market panel. We have Sean O'Hara, president of PASA ETFs, and Harley Vassman, simplifies managing partner. Welcome to you both. So, Harley, I first want to start with you. How would you characterize the action that we're seeing in the market to end the week? You know, all we're trying to do is basically process the Fed, process inflation, process interest rates. They've kind of told us what's going to happen over here, and it's going to play out a little more than people thought, but very slowly. And the market's got to go to just the fact that we're going to have higher rates for the next six months or so. So, Sean, what do you think that means for the market action over the next couple of months? And did you hear anything this week, either from the Fed or from the jobs report this morning or earnings reports that really made you maybe change your view about the coming months? Well, thanks for having me. No, nothing I heard this week really change any other than the resounding announcement this morning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,88,2022-11-04 20:02:40
4901," It really made you maybe change your view about the coming months. Well, thanks for having me. No, nothing I heard this week really changed any other than the resounding announcement this morning on the job side, which sort of gives cover to the Fendt to continue their path forward in terms of aggressively raising interest rates. And so for the entire year, that's been the theme. High inflation, high interest rates means lower PEs for starting. We were seeing those PEs come down. They're now sort of still above historical levels, but down quite substantially, but that doesn't mean that they can't continue to fall. And so the advice we had been giving to people all year long is it's time for you to lower your overall portfolio's PEs before the market does it to you. It's done a fair amount and it probably can continue to do some more, but there are places in this market to make money. I think if you buy high quality stocks with high free cash flow or high free cash flow yield, you can buy stocks that are cheaper than the overall market unless susceptible to that multiple. And the contraction that always seems to go hand in hand with rising interest rates and rising inflation and the two standouts in our largest ETF that two standouts are two biggest sector weights are energy and health care with a little tilt. The third would be materials. And so we've been positioned pretty well and that fund is a large KBUS fund that's basically up for the year, even though the markets down more than 20%. And obviously we tend to watch the bond markets for any sort of signals anytime the Fed speaks so highly you're known as the convexity maven talk about the movement that you're seeing in bonds and what the volatility there is telling you. Well, I mean rate volatility is very high. So the move index, which is the the VIX for bonds is running around 141.50, which is basically it's price levels, but the reality is the market is moving that much every day. So it's legit the contrast of course is the VIX, it's 25, which is not that far above its long term average. It's talked to down 20% but it's been an orderly decline. We just don't know how far the Fed's going to take us and that's the uncertainty in bonds and that's why they're gapping up and down so much. But I will tell you that my view is that we're getting near the peak for the front end. The Fed might take rates to 475, maybe 5%, but the two year where it is right now is probably pricing in the right number. And what we don't know is the back end. Long term rates have not risen up. The curve's inverted and the inversion in the market market. You'll come very good at calling on recessions as calling for one next year and the markets pricing it out for recession sometime next year. Well we get that I don't know but that's the uncertainty of the stock market as we can't tell if earnings are going to drop or not. But the bottom market they've kind of got this thing pegged. Convexity, Maven, Harley, I like that. Sean, let me ask you about what you said earlier here when you talked about a negressive Fed. What do you think is most likely? I guess do you think a 75 basis point hike is on the table and how much of that has been priced into the market if at all at this point? Yeah, and so some of it probably has. But I think it's likely that you'll see 75 basis points out of the Fed this next move only because the job market continues to remain fairly strong. I think the things to watch from the Fed side is if they start to see massive demand destruction in terms of the overall economy and you start to see unemployment start to rise, then they'll be in a position where the perhaps they need to sort of ease up a little bit. I think that's what we're all hoping at some point that the Fed will ease. But I don't think I got anything out of what Chairman Powell said this week in any of the recent actions that would let me come to the conclusion that they're going to do anything other than what they said, which is continued to aggressively raise interest rates to try to tame inflation. John, what about the risk of the Fed going too far? Do you think that that is a possibility up until this point? You know, they hardly ever get it right. So, you know, they probably will go too far. You know, I have a different view on what the real problem is right now. I don't think it's an overheated economy. I think it's energy prices that are driving inflation across all parts of the sectors of our economy. And I think that's a supply issue, as opposed to a real interest rate driven solution. And so they probably will get it wrong. You know, the thing that you have to keep an eye on, it will tell you whether they're really getting it wrong is if inflation starts to peak, or pick up. And then guidance is really the most important thing going forward. So you've got a range on S&P earnings for next year, somewhere between $200 a share and $233 a share. So it's perhaps at the high end. But as these companies start to, you know, get through this fourth quarter and start to give.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,89,2022-11-04 20:06:38
4902," Thanks for the next year, somewhere between $200 who share and $233 shares, so perhaps at the high end. But as these companies start to get through this fourth quarter and start to give us a little hint for what's coming forward, if we see guidance sort of wane a little bit and move towards the downside, then that will tell you that we're probably not going to have this solved the landing in the stock market as the Fed really wants. So, Holly, if we go by their mantra, don't fight the Fed. What does this mean for how people should be balancing their portfolio as in preparation for recession as you're expecting in the next 12 months? Well, I would push back on our other guest over here a little bit. I think the Fed goes 15 next time. I think they're going to go higher than we thought, but they're going to get there slowly. They've already done four big hikes over here. The Minus Nest kind of worked for a little bit. I also don't think that it's actually oil energy per se. I think labor, cost of labor is the real driver over here. The demographics underlying that. What I like in the market, though, I think uni bonds and mortgage bonds have gotten brushed. And they're very solved. They're very safe. You're not taking credit risk with those securities. So, if we do get a recession, we do get the down earnings, we do get the unemployment. You're not going to get hurt with those two investments. Harley Basmonds, Sean O'Hara, we'll have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a good weekend. Thank you, YouTube.

4903," Nathan's in a division of SVB, a security is Lisa. It's good to see you cover all three of these companies. So you're the perfect person to have on to ask about this. Let's start with the movement that we've seen in block. We saw shares really take off today following the results that we got last night closing up just over 10% in a note out today. You wrote that after a wild ride over the past two and a half years, blocks business is emerging from the pandemic stronger than ever. Why? So in a couple ways, the cash app business, I'd say, is the real standout. That's their digital bank. They reported yesterday they're up to almost 50 million monthly active users in that product and about 18 million folks that use it like a primary bank account just for a point of reference. Like a JP Morgan or a city have about 30 million mobile bankers. So this is like more than half of where they are. Those are all consumers. What happened during the pandemic when banks were closed, right? And people were home. They downloaded and adopted something like cash app as a form of digital banking. And blocks just done a fantastic job of building an ecosystem around that and really, really pulled in those consumers. That product literally was almost zero five years ago and is now contributing more than half of the gross profits of the company. So, Lucy, in that digital wallet was a survey that you guys have, what stood out to you in terms of the demographics and really the opportunities for growth there? Yeah, it's true. What's interesting is that the digital banks skew younger in terms of cohorts, as you might imagine. But otherwise, there's no particular groups that stand out. They're not lower income. Sometimes there's a perception that the digital bank users are more unbanked. They are actually not. They're very mainstream. These are just simply individuals that are very mobile first and prefer to do all aspects of their life through mobile. But what cash app and what block are really doing there is they are trying to add services to move their way up market to adding investing services, adding lending products to migrate their way up to a more affluent consumer that has a higher spending power, which is how they generate a lot of the revenue for those products. Lucy, how are you looking at blocks crypto part of its business? Because revenue from Bitcoin this quarter, 1.76 billion, that was off about 3% from a year ago, slightly missing the streets expectations. Is this a risk? Do you think for the company given the activity or lack really thereof that we've seen in the crypto market, as of late? Well, it's not a risk in the sense that it runs through the income statement in kind of a funky way. So it shows up as a very big revenue line item and a very big cost item, but you really just net those out. And it's only a couple percent contribution to the gross profit of the company. But it is a very big engagement driver and usage driver. Like a reason people download these apps and really engage with the app's daily will be if they're very active in crypto. And so when we're in a low period like this, a block has to find other ways to engage consumers through other products. Like for example, they bought after pay, one of the big find-out pay later players who has very strong digital shopping services and they're starting to integrate some of that sort of shopping and kind of deals and promotion type of services into the app too. So Lisa obviously then talking about PayPal, which was one of the first names in this space, clearly losing market share to some of this competition here. What is the gross story then for PayPal at this point? They've also tried to add on some services as well. Yeah, PayPal's and it is true. It's there in a challenging position in the sense that they're the granddaddy of this space. They've been so dominant for so long that it's hard for them to maintain that level of a leadership position when you've got Apple Pay and you've got the players like a cash app or a buy-now pay later players kind of nipping away at their heels. So what PayPal has done, I mean, a part of their offering I would highlight is that they have, they bought a company called Brain Tree a number of years ago, which is the big competitor of Stripe and Audien. So more on the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,91,2022-11-04 20:15:15
4904," And highlight is that they bought a company called BrainTree a number of years ago, which is the big competitor of Stripe and Audien, so more on the merchant side. So providing the merchants with a wide set of services, the digital wallets, of course, and the checkout button, but also overall payment processing, things like loans for merchants. So they're sort of steering a lot of their business more toward the merchant side of the equation, where they compete, like I said, with player, you know, some of these big high growth players, like an Audien and a Stripe. Lisa, let's move over to Coinbase because we're seeing the stock pop today, close in the green, well in the green. Yet the company reported a wider loss, revenue was all 54%, shares down nearly 80% this year, yet you have an outperform rating on the stock. Why are you bullish on this name? I love Coinbase. I mean, there's a long-term play, there's no question. And the reality is we're likely, you know, historically crypto winters have typically lasted about two years and we're only about six or nine months into this one, so we've probably got a ways to go if history is any indicator. So there may not be arguably that much urgency, but in terms that we, I think of Coinbase as a very unique asset as a large cap, publicly listed player in crypto and way to play crypto, they're very differentiated in sort of the crypto infrastructure space. You're starting to see them doing these partnerships with a BlackRock or with a Google, where they're sort of the crypto inside, so to speak, where they're providing crypto onboard and capabilities digital assets storage, the ability to convert Fiat into crypto and sort of creating that, you know, they're the plumbing or the rails in those applications. And it's that aspect of their business that I get really excited about. For example, in this quarter, you know, yes, their kind of core transactional revenues are down significantly because just overall crypto trading activity is down, but their subscription and services businesses, which are all of these infrastructure type of services, were up over 40% quarter on quarter, that's sequentially, and are now almost a third of the revenues of Coinbase. And that's the piece I'd really be keeping an eye on over the next couple of years as it becomes a larger part of this business. Coinbase certainly growing with those partnerships, growing its ecosystem. Thank you, Dileesa Ellis. Great to see you have a wonderful weekend. Well, crypto exchange Binance reportedly processing billions of dollars in trades for Iranian firms as to spite US sanctions. Yavu Finance is Jen Shonbogen joins us now with the details, hey Jen. Good afternoon, Michelle. That's right, crypto exchange Binance reportedly processing Iranian transactions in value of nearly $8 billion since 2018, despite US sanctions aimed at cutting Iran off from the global financial system. Writers conducted an analysis with data from three firms that had access to chain analysis reactor investigation software and found that some $7.8 billion of funds flowed between Binance and Iran's largest crypto exchange, Nobitec. Three quarters of Iran's funds that pass through Binance were in a cryptocurrency called TRON. That gives users the option to conceal their identities according to Writers Analysis. Now, in a blog post today, Binance's head of global sanctions, Shagree Boyrez, wrote that as soon as Binance discovered that Iran-based crypto exchanges may have attempted to move crypto through Binance's exchange, the company quote, move to freeze transfers, block accounts, and follow the protocols that are by our compliance team. Boyrez went on to say, we immediately set up a task force to resolve the issue. Any failure of the system is unacceptable to us. And while Binance isn't a US company required to follow American law, we work hard to keep sanctioned individuals off our platform. Now, the head of sanction says Binance uses strong know your customer protocols and invests in technology to ensure that the people who should not be using Binance's exchange are not able to access their ecosystem. But admits the changes playing catch-up and that this is an industry-wide issue. Now, these new findings come as the US Department of Justice is pursuing an investing-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,92,2022-11-04 20:19:35
4905," But admits the dangers playing catch up and that this is an industry-wide issue. Now, these new findings come as the U.S. Department of Justice is pursuing an investigation into possible violations of money laundering rules by Binance. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to the Yahoo Finance for comment. And Treasury also declined to comment saying it does not weigh in on potential violations of U.S. sanctions. Guys. Well, certainly more scrutiny to come. I'm sure a big thank you to our very own Gen. Shonberg. Thanks so much. All right, well staying with crypto, Dogecoin's recent rally coming off the boil amid reports that Elon Musk might scrap or at least postpone his ambitions for some form of integration with Twitter. Online tech publication platformer reporting the social media group's plans over a crypto wallet quote, appear to be on pause. Now Dogecoin rallied over 50 percent the day Musk completed his takeover. And shot up 60 percent over the last seven days but clearly might lose some of their lustre. All right, coming up, former president Donald Trump keeping Republicans on edge about his 2024 plans, but he may finally be ready to make his decision for timeline straight ahead. Well, markets finished the week on upbeat note. The Dow did snap a four week winning streak, but tech still cannot catch a break. Sure as a Facebook parent company meta down more than 73 percent this year making it the worst performer in the S&P 500. And Michelle, we just were talking to Michael Wolf, Alastair, and he was telling us that the company made the phrase metaverse completely cringe worthy. And we see that reflected in the stock price we know meta has lost billions on their VR and AR initiatives, 9.4 billion. So far this year and those losses they're expected to continue to grow. I feel like Emerson's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,93,2022-11-04 20:24:03
4906," billions on their VR and AR initiatives, 9.4 billion, so far this year in those losses they're expected to continue to grow. I feel like Emerson's they changed the name from Facebook to Meta. It really has been something of a curse for them. Obviously they struggled with the Apple privacy laws affecting their revenue there. And really people are still waiting for Meta to get off the ground. Most people either don't know what it is, aren't really understanding the real world, but they're still using it beyond things like occasional gaming, which is what Michael Wolf was saying. Nobody wants to be stuck in a VR world for more than half an hour at a time. So I think this is going to be a long haul. Some people are estimating maybe 10 years before they'd be more widespread adoption. I don't know if investors are willing to wait that long. No, clearly not. Indeed. Exactly. Well, after the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe vs. Wade, voters appeared incensed enough to give Democrats momentum they needed heading into the midterms. But with the election just days away, high inflation and its effects on the economy appeared to be boosting Republicans' chances across the country. Well, for more we're joined by Jo, who financed senior columnist Rick Newman. So Rick, talk about these latest findings we're seeing. We just showed the charts showing that inflation has actually been improving gradually. The peak was at 9% in June. It's now down to 8.2%. Probably going to fall down to around 8% in the next report next week. But consumers actually are getting more worried about inflation, not less worried. And I dug into a big series of surveys the Census Bureau does on a regular basis to gauge how people are doing. They started it this after COVID. And it shows that more people say they are having trouble paying for daily bills now than said so in June when inflation was actually higher and it's considerably higher than it was a year ago. So I think this says two things. One, I think it says, on the longer inflation lasts, the more worried people get about it as they probably should because it's not just going to come and go. It's going to be here and we're going to have sustained price acts for a long time. And I think there probably is also a cumulative impact on family budgets. So when prices go up and stay up, it just is draining and draining and draining over time. And maybe a lot of families can handle one month of higher than expected costs. But when that goes on month after month after month, it gets tougher. And the same sort of everybody, the Census Bureau also shows that more people now are tapping into savings or putting everyday expenses on credit cards. So I think this is why you have seen voters even as gas prices come down. Other bills are going up and voters know that. I mean, they're seeing this every week when they pay bills. And this is why Biden just cannot catch a break even though other parts of the economy notably the job market and the numbers we got today are pretty good. So I think, I mean, we have seen Democratic odds of holding onto Congress just deteriorating for the last month or so. And barring a miracle, they're going to lose either one or both houses next week. Yeah, I'm rick speaking on this momentum that we certainly have seen with the GOP party here as of recent weeks. There's an Axios report out earlier today saying that Trump was potentially eyeing an announcement of the 2024 of his 2024 presidential run on November 14th. I'm just curious, just your reaction to this and just what this signals here for Republicans over the next two years. My reaction is let the circus begin, baby. Let's get started. This is not necessarily good for Republicans. So there's a lot going on behind the scenes here. First of all, many people who are following the never ending Trump spectacle think there's a good chance the federal government could bring charges against him for for his mishandling of classified documents down at his home in Florida after he left the White House. He was not supposed to have classified documents. He did. We that could have been quite alarming. And the Trump probably as it's almost part of his legal defense. You can imagine that he wants to make himself a presidential candidate if the Justice Department is going to go after him so that it makes it look as if it's purely political, which it is not, by the way. He's also facing a very serious lawsuit in Georgia over possible election fraud. There's a grand jury on that with possible charges by sometime next year. Again, Trump probably thinks it will help him out if this looks politically motivated because he's a political candidate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,94,2022-11-04 20:28:16
4907," There's a grand jury on that with possible charges by sometime next year. Again, Trump probably thinks it will help him out if this looks politically motivated because he's a political candidate being prosecuted by a Democrat in Fulton County, Lanna. So there's that element to it. Then there's the whole question of the Florida Governor Ron DeSantis try to run in 2024 as well. Perhaps a more conventional campaign not launched two years ahead of time, but maybe more like 18 months or one year ahead of time. Which would put Trump into Santhus at odds with each other. So that would probably be quite a smackdown. And let's just make sure everybody understands. Trump standing in the Republican Party has declined. I think there are polls now that say, the majority of Republicans say Trump should not run again. So if he does run, it is by no means a given that he would win. Certainly we'll be entertaining watch to say the least. Rick Newman, as always, thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Hi guys, you too. All right, well, come here. Next out of office, companies are rethinking the real estate plans. But how much of a hit does this mean that this sector can take? We speak with the next word from JLL. Next. All right. All right, but sorry about OK. Okay. You This is our rethinking how and where their employees work. Many companies decide not to resign leases in favor of keeping their workers at home. Exxon mobile might be joining them. There's a report in the journal today that the oil joint is considering leasing or selling its unused office space in Houston. The company reporting that only a fraction of its less than half of the available office space that it has on its Houston campus is being used. For more on this and what this means for the commercial real estate market, we want to bring in John Gates, JLL CEO of America's markets. John, it's good to see you Exxon far from the only company. We also heard metad making a similar move in and Atlanticdot? We've been thinking about the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,95,2022-11-04 20:32:52
4908," a bring in John Gates, J-L-L-C-E-O of America's markets. John, it's good to see you, Exxon, far from the only company. We also heard meta making a similar move in Austin earlier this week. Is this consistent with the trends that you're seeing? The corporate America, probably global corporate, still sort of struggle with what return to the office is going to mean on a permanent basis. So we think hybrid work in some form of fashion is here to stay for many companies. And there are some workers that probably would continue to work from home or work remotely much, if not all of the time. Yes, but there is a greater return to office probably that people are aware of right now. And John, what's the regional story? Where are you seeing the most growth when it comes to the return to office story? It is definitely, there is a regional story. So in the United States, that would be across the South. The immigration markets, we call them, but Phoenix is a winter, Metro Dallas is a winter. Austin is a winter, Nashville, Charlotte, Atlanta, certainly South Florida, the Metro Miami area. So it's almost across the board in the larger cities or metro areas across the Southern US. John, you mentioned it was a little bit greater than we think outside of those top cities. What are we seeing play out in the rest of the country? And what did the vacancy rates look like? It definitely varies by city, right? So industries and geographies vary, but it is taking up nationally to very close to 50%. And we're predicting that by the end of the first quarter, could be as high as 60% on an average day, which is a pretty good metric. Office buildings have never been 100% full, right? People come and go, they travel from business, they have personalized that they're working with. So, but vacancy rates are higher in those southern cities, and then the other very strong trend we see is what we call a flight to quality. So newer, you know, better space, more monetized, maybe a better location, closer to public transportation. Space that has a cool factor to it. It's got maybe a good retail amenities in the neighborhood. Those buildings are definitely leasing at a materially higher rate. And they have much greater occupancy than older product does. And John, what do you see in terms of leasing and rental prices? How do they stack up versus pre-pandemic? Tail of two cities. So if we take the last comments for the newer product, the flight to quality, we're seeing all-time peak rents set in probably two-thirds of the big markets in the United States in the last 12 counter months, probably even this year. So that's very different than what we're seeing happen with older office buildings, where they're struggling to maintain rents as high as they had pre-pandemic. So it's very binary in that regard, I would say. John, when you take this and also, I guess, combine the fact that we're in a rising rate environment right now, the Fed saying it's going to remain committed to raising rates that obviously could spell some trouble here for commercial real estate. I'm curious just how this has impacted your investment opportunities. And are you being more conservative given the current macro environment? You're probably more conservative, more disciplined in your decision making, depending on where you're looking. Interest rates, excuse me, commercial office space rely on long-term capital and often debt is part of the capital structure in those. And so the cost of capital is going up. It's going up for all operating businesses as well. And so you're selective in where you look. We see a slowdown in velocity of both sales of assets right now in commercial mortgages. There's a lot less construction activity and any kind of commercial asset class. And I think that'll continue for a while because as you know, the Fed has been very clear that they're not done. And John, is there any sense of when you might see this normalizing at some point? I would think at the end of the first quarter, maybe. I think business people, whether they're investors or operators and operating businesses, want to see trends. And so, inflation's ticked out a little bit. If it starts, if it clearly to business people is moving downward and the Fed's actions are working, that gives a little more predictability to people. And I think you'll start to see transaction activity increase at that time, whether it's signing commercial leases or selling assets or recapitalizing and refinancing them. So, you know, my sense would be that's probably late Q1 or maybe early Q2, but we'll need to can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,96,2022-11-04 20:36:56
4909," or selling assets or recapitalizing and refinancing them. So, you know, my sense would be that's probably late Q1 or maybe early Q2, but we'll need to continue to watch. There's a lot of been flashering pressure out there still. And as we look through the supply chain, whether it's things like labor and in developing some of these things, as well as some of the construction materials prices, what are some of the headwinds or what are some of the pricing that you're expecting there? I think labor will be a greater challenge than supply chain disruptions and spikes in materials cost. Much of the supply chain is renormalized. You see container shipments as an example. The cost of container shipments have come back and the demand for materials has slowed. When you move interest rates as much as they have, you see construction activity really slow down. It has a major impact on the single family housing market, as we all know, and mortgages get very, very expensive. So you see a smaller velocity of people moving and you certainly see a dramatic slow down in construction starts. We have a labor shortage though in our country and our economy. And I think that continues in non-office working jobs for sure. And we have a lot of stimulus still coming. So I think construction spend will shift to maybe ESG related activities, for example, and that needs work and labor as well. So I think materials will be less of a problem, supply chains, and cost of materials will be less of a problem than availability of labor and probably the cost of labor. Certainly a lot to keep an eye on. We do appreciate you breaking all this down for us, John Gates. Thank you so much. Have a great week. Thank you for having me. All right, coming up, fans of Weird Al Yankovich songs like Armageddon Paradise and like a surgeon will be rushing to turn on the Roku channel this weekend or details on the new film next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,97,2022-11-04 20:41:28
4910," It's been a busy week of earnings here. Some of the biggest movers of the week. Let's kick it off with Roku. It's the top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance over the last couple of days. It shares, really took a dive. You can see it reflected in this five-day chart here after a wider than expected loss during the quarter, just another company to suffer from the pullback that we've seen in ads spending shares hitting the lowest level that we've seen since 2019. The week results leading to a number of downgrades on the street. Pivotal research lowering its rating on the stock to sell from hold to Guggenheim, cutting its rating to neutral from by the five-day move in the chart shares closing off just around 9% just below 50 bucks a share. Let's move over to Peloton another wild week in this stock. Although you can see the weekly gains of just over 17% shares initially sold off after the company disappointed the street with its earnings, but they were reassured by some comments that we got from CEO Barry McCarthy, Barry McCarthy making some comments on the turnaround plan. Saying that it was further along, then maybe the street had progressed, saying, quote, the ship is turning. Taking a look at the week to date chart up just around 17% still though below 10 bucks a share. We'll also take a look at Uber another big mover earlier in the week shares soared after the company posted a revenue beat and strong guidance closing Tuesday up 11% sales during the third quarter from 72% from just a year ago for the week. You see a bit of those muted gains, so giving back it at the latter end of the week with Uber closing up just around 3% 28.39 a share. Now let's round it out with Starbucks as we take a look at that five-day chart up just around 5.5% having its best day today and about six months is not closing up just around 8.5% 91.86 a share. Third quarter earnings, beef is street's expectations. Also the company issuing strong fourth quarter guidance. A number of analysts boosting their price targets as a result, RBC upping its target to 80. Bucks credit suites up in there as to 105 Goldman, lifting their price target to 98 bucks a share all about where Starbucks is trading today again for the week shares closing up just around 5.5% for sure. All right, great stuff. Well now here's a look at what we're keeping in mind on Fort next week. On Monday, a quiet day on the economic calendar, but we will get results from Palantir, Lyft and Gaming Giants Activision Blizzard and Take 2 Interactive. And of course the big event on Tuesday, the midterm elections. But on the earnings front there are some key names to watch, especially Disney after the close. Also here from AMC, Occidental Petroleum, Affirm and a CUMI. On Wednesday, roadblocks, Wendy's and Home Builder DR Horton, among the names that are going to be reporting their quarterly earnings. And on Thursday we'll get some economic data including jobless claims, but all eyes will be on the consumer price index, which is out ahead of the open. On the earnings front, retailers Ralph Lauren and Tapestry will also report. And finally, rounding out the week on Friday, we'll get the latest reading on consumer sentiment, certainly lots, for the Fed to digest. Well Twitter offices closed today as employees and now former employees were told earlier they're being laid off or fired via email. And the backlash, now raising the question, in this time of working from home, how do you fire people respectfully? Or quit your job for that matter? Now prior to the pandemic, it was customary to have an in-person conversation, but how have norms shifted in our Slack message and Zoom meeting world shorter? Is there a good way to do it? Do you want to have people travel from wherever they are just to show up and get fired? I think that might be worse. Yeah, that could be worse. And obviously if they live far away, you would have a tough time. I think bringing them into the office, just alone, just knowing what you're going to do. But I don't think you should do this over Slack or through an email. I think if you aren't located in the office, if you're not seeing your boss on a day-to-day basis, set up a Google Meet, set up a Zoom. That is so common these days. And I think that is much more acceptable if you're not in the office every day. If you're in the office every day, you clearly should be having that in-person conversation. I think people that are making the decision to do this, maybe tend to be on the younger side of the workforce. So I don't really understand, I guess, how-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,98,2022-11-04 20:45:41
4911," A younger side of the workforce, I don't really understand, I guess, how small certain industries can be. You don't want to burn any bridges. And I think you're likely to do that if you do quit via Slack or email. It's true. I mean, you have some people just announcing that they're leaving their jobs on TikTok, which is a horrible, horrible trend, a horrible idea. But I think, as you mentioned, at least if you can't be face-to-face in person, at least over video chat. I'm not one of these horrible, sort of, mass-firing. It's just one-on-one. Just like it was when you hired the person, give them that same respect on the way out. I think that's you. I think that's the tasteful way to do it. It's not an easy conversation to ever have, but at least try and make it as respectful as you can. It'll be worth having it face-to-face. We're in agreeance on that. Hopefully, people watching also agree with that as well. All right, moving on to another story that we're watching your big day for Roku, the streaming platform, releasing its original biopic film, Weird the Ow, Yank of X Story. Yeah, we're financing this, Al Jender, Canal, it joins us now with more, and Alie, when you take a look at Roku's move here, I guess, what is this signal just in terms of its content push? This is certainly Roku's biggest original yet. It really adds to this push from the company to try its hand at original programming. You saw Daniel Rackliff just there. He is in the title role. We also have other really strong A-list stars like Evan Rachel Wood, Rain Wilson. I will say, if you think back to some of the other streaming giants, like a Netflix or an Apple TV Plus, there was always that one show, that one movie that really solidified their spot in the streaming wars, had everyone sort of look at them a little differently. This could be the thing for Roku. I remember for me for Netflix, it was Halse cards, Apple TV Plus, I think you could argue Ted Lasso. This film is a success. That could be something huge for Roku moving forward. Of course, Roku is free, so you can watch this for free, but it will have ads because Roku's business model really relies on ads. We saw that really impact earnings as you were dispensiting this past quarter. If Roku can be successful with this original content push, they can keep people within the ecosystem and really monetize that, that's more revenue opportunity for them moving forward. This could potentially be a game changer. Yeah, it couldn't really be. I will say for that weird-out movie, still hard for me to see Daniel Rackliff as anybody else on the Mid-Harris Potter, but you know- You're a man, that's my eye. That's my eye. Yeah. Now I also want to talk about James Cameron's avatar at the way of the water. That set to hit theaters December 16th. Now, 20th Century Studios releasing the official trailer. Take a listen. So what does her heart beat sound like? Mighty. Now it does look gorgeous, but it is long. So Ali, do you expect Avatar the way of the water to be a box office blowout? I really do. I mean, this film takes place 10 years from where the original film left off. And of course, it's been 13 years since we first saw the original movie. That's why theaters have been re-releasing it in theaters. And that's actually been very successful. It's added to box office gains. So even though this is a 13-year-old movie, people are still going to the theater. They want to refresh their memory so that they are fully prepared for when this sequel debuts on December 16th. When I went to Disney's D23 convention, they actually showed five very long clips of this. And I got to say, people were owing and awing. The film was very excited in the crowd. The cinematography was amazing. James Cameron, he really wanted this film to debut in a theater. He wanted to wait until the technology was there. So I think there's a lot of hype around this film. And I certainly think it's going to be one of the biggest movies, probably the biggest movie of the year. Of course, it will follow Marvel's Wakanda forever. So just a lot to look forward to at the box office as we round out 2023. And it will set us up for hopefully the successful 2024 because we are still below pre-pandemic levels. We'll see how the way of water can add to those. I mean, I will say it's visually stunning. If there's ever a movie you're going to want to see on the big screen, it does seem to be this. Three hours, though. I don't know if you'd want to bring the kids. We already saw it with the Irishman and things like that. People are having to watch it. We're going to focus on the process we set the speaker in on both of the forwards. We are not going to force those thoughts on theopes of leads, not to every second for a unseren or 다른 issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,99,2022-11-04 20:50:12
4912," Bix, we need does seem to be this. Three hours though, I don't know if you'd want to bring the kids. You know, we already saw it with the Irishman. It's like that people are having to watch it in segments just so they can get through it. Three hours is a pretty long time. It took me three days to watch the Irishman. I totally, I don't know if that speaks to my attention span or the quality of the film. I don't really know. But yes, it is a long movie. I do think our attention spans a short end. We'll see, but I don't think that's going to stop people for this one. I don't know, Shana. I feel like people are ready for it. I think people who saw the first avatar will be very excited to return to the theaters. I also think they have a massive selling point in. If you watch this at home, it simply is not the same experience. You need to watch it in theaters. I think it's going to be a massive, massive thing. Thank you. We'll see. All right, Ali, can I have a good weekend? All right, coming up next. You've got one in 292 million, that's all chance, of winning the Power Ball tomorrow night. And maybe tiny, but that's still a chance. So if you do win, what next? We'll tell you exactly what to do when we come back. Thank you. $1.6 billion. That's the power of Jackpot. Now making it the largest on record. And of course you still have plenty of time to buy a ticket ahead of the drawing tomorrow nights. So what happens if you strike it big? Or Wells Fargo, Wealth and Investment Managing Director Emily Irwin joined us now with a look at what to do if you're lucky enough to win big. So obviously a lot of people get very excited about this but it's important to have a plan in place. Talk about some of the initial steps people should be taking. Absolutely. And thank you for having me. The first thing to really consider is putting a communication plan in place.

4913," really consider is putting a communication plan in place. And that communication plan is comprised of with whom are you going to share this big news, when and how. And so thinking about the who, friends and family, keeping that circle tight and close, and ensuring that no one's going to share the news on your behalf is key. Secondly, you want to comprise a team. And thinking about assembling that team, you very often can have up to a year to claim that powerball ticket. And so thinking about that team to help you buy some time, considering how to take the payments, thinking about an attorney, an accountant, a charitable advisor, as well as an investment advisor. And then finally, how are you going to share the news? After you determine that it's the time to go claim your winnings, are you going to be able to minimize any scammers by ensuring some privacy, this is very state by state, but this is certainly not the time to post yourself in your winning ticket on social media. Emily, and then of course you have the massive decision or whether you should go with the lump sum, which in this case would be right around $782 million, or if you should opt for that yearly payout. What should people consider? And I guess what advice do you have for that lucky winner if you do get a winner in this drawing? Well, when you're thinking about the lump sum, of course, you're going to have more control over how you invest those assets. And for many, that is critical to their decision making. They like the assuriveness that they're going to receive those winnings and be able to determine how to invest or spend them over the years. By contrast, if you're someone who you have a dollar in your pocket and you're going to spend it, an annuity might be a better strategy for you. Or if you're someone that you think you're going to have a hard time saying no, whether it's to friends or family or organizations, you might want a little bit more peace of mind knowing that every single time that your calendar turns over, you're going to be receiving another payment. And so I think part of it is behavioral finance. How do you interact with your finances? And part of it is how much control do you want? And how much do you want to have that money now versus having it doled out over a number of years? So really have to understand your financial personality before making a decision like this. Now, obviously, we read a lot of heartbreaking stories about people who won the lottery and end up going bankrupt, going broke. What are some of the mistakes that people should really try and avoid? What are some of the don'ts? Yeah, unfortunately, there are those individuals that that winning ticket is something they wish they never had in their hand. And so some best practices are put a plan in place and put a budget in place, as insane as that sounds. For someone who's going to win that ticket, this will very likely catapult them into a different financial stratosphere. Not only what are the outlays of cash that they expect over the next few years, but what are the ongoing maintenance costs of those types of expenses? And it might be something that they're not used to, a financial plan or an investment plan with scenarios and analysis supporting all of their wishes and goals can really help bring some dollars and cents to maybe some of their hopes. And then secondly, thinking about ways to really communicate with those around you as you may be seen as a bank within your community going forward, making sure that you have some sort of a mission statement or a intentional giving statement. So you have the flexibility and peace of mind to be able to say yes and say no as you're approached by different individuals and organizations. All right, Emily Irwin. Emily, real quick, are you playing? Absolutely. I already have my tickets. Oh, good. Good for you. I was going to have to run out and buy one. All right, Emily Irwin, great to have you.
