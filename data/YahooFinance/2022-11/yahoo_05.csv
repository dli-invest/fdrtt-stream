3817," Within that answer, however, Connor, you did remind me of my second reason that I upgraded my couch, which is because I'm not getting on a cruise. Connor, cunning him. Morius research director. Thanks so much. Joining us here today, appreciate it. Guys, coming up on the other side of this short break, the turning tide, question mark, a mega market cat behemoth, corded by retail and institutional investors alike. But, what could it take for Apple to turn Rotten? Maybe just one report. Sizey State is up next. Well, can Apple do anything wrong? That's the question. As the tech giant Reddy's a new update to iOS devices that promises everything from more accessible fitness to clean energy charging investors, they're waiting for an update of their own. The company is set to release earnings next week. For a closer look, let's turn to Sizey State. Size is what we find you do today. Alright, what's clean energy charging? I know. Is that mean my phone is going to charge magically? I thought it was an EV term, honestly. You might be right. Alright, let's run this down because Apple earnings are in fact coming up. So here's my little preview for your folks. Overarching theme I think of this preview is the street is really expecting some good things from Apple. First up, what Wall Street is saying into earnings. One, this quarter may not stop out concerns of a hardware slowdown. We've seen a big PC slowdown that has impacted the likes of AMD Intel Unaming in the chip space. There is some concern on that hardware slowing down. Notably as it pertains to iPad, potentially hitting Apple in this quarter. Next, the street is expecting a slight earnings beat by Apple. So maybe one to two cents. I've seen some whisper numbers out there on the street looking for a beat by Apple of about five cents. So something to keep in mind. Also to iPhone, iPad demand will help offset FX challenges. That's the vibe on the street. Maybe I would be a little concerned with the iPad just given the slowdown we have seen in the PC market. But by and large, the new iPhones have launched very, very well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,1,2022-10-21 13:57:10
3818," FX challenges, that's the vibe on the street. Maybe I would be a little concerned with the iPad, just given the slowdown we have seen in the PC market. But by and large, the new iPhones have launched very, very well. Next up here, potential red flags, areas of concern you should be on the lookout for. And there I am holding or flying that Apple flag right there. One, December quarter guidance. It is universally the vibe out there on the street is even though Apple may have had a good quarter here, that guidance for the holiday quarter may come in pretty conservative relative to estimates, given what you see on FX, given what you see about pressure, and the Chinese economy, and of course, our own slowdown here in the US, economics slowdown, that is. Number two, China, as I just mentioned, a concern by analysts. And lastly, work from home impact on various Apple devices, notably that iPad. And I do want to call out to give a little analyst shot out here to Barclays, Claudia Gilbert Tallinn. She's noting here this, looking out to December quarter, we are unsure what guidance management will give. But we expect some conservatism, like I just mentioned, given the macro backdrop despite the extra weeks, since the December quarter has 14 weeks. So it's this district's overall, I would say, expecting for Apple to do it, have a good quarter, beat on earnings, have a conservative guidance. It might take, if Netflix positively surprised the market, dot, dot, dot, you would think Apple would step up here and post a good quarter of its own. It's just a matter of how will the stock react? If you do get, let's say, five-cent earnings be in conservative guidance. Now the argument could be made, that is priced into the stock here, which sets it up for a positive reaction on earnings day, but again, that's just like throwing darts. Yeah, I think services will outperform. Services is seen as one of those little luxuries that consumers will lean into, even as they kind of bat in the hatches on their own spending. But then on the other side, there is this question. And it could already be priced in very well to the stock, is on the demand side that they're seeing for the iPhones, where they've already, according to reports, pulled back some of the kind of iPhone Pro, or the iPhone, yeah, the iPhone Pro model pulled back some of the production on that in response to what they had been seeing on the demand front and reading through to see exactly where they were looking at a consumer that was more affluent, had more of the appetite to spend up to get the iPhone Pro Max. And so with that, you've got the higher tier that's selling better, the question that I would have going into this report though, is on what volume? And that is something why I've been paying close attention to the telecom companies this quarter, is especially what they're saying around, whether or not customers are actually trading up or trading down, and they're saying that they're trading up right now. So it leads you to believe that maybe they're opting in to that higher tier phone, it's just a question of how many of them? Right, and one, I think what we could agree on here, this will be a market-rooting report, especially in this environment, where there's a lot of macroeconomic concerns here, Apple's report next week will very much set the tone. Absolutely, we're also keeping an eye on another tech company here coming up on the other side of the short break. Snapshares, yeah, they are getting hammered to the tune of 30% lower on the back of its third quarter report. We're going to speak to Jeffrey's Brent Dale, next. [#FçoRESA I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same.

3819," [♪ Nice guitar musicㅎㅎ?] Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saazi here with Brad Smith, Julie Heimann as the day off. This is our tiptoeing into the weekend as traders gear up for a big wave of earnings next week. Right now you're seeing all three major indices. I would say maybe a little bit more than tiptoeing. We're seeing the Dow up almost 335 points. Here's what else we're watching at this moment. No recession. American Express shares are under. We're under a little pressure after the company didn't raise its full year earnings guidance range. The stock is still under pressure. CO Steven's square, he tells me concerns of a recession are overblown. The dialing up in earnings beat Verizon shares are in focus after the company beat on earnings but posted weak subscriber gains. Brad Chaat with Ryzen Seal Hans Vesberg who noted that there are points of weakness in that earnings report more on that one on the Yowl Finance homepage right now. And it's time to travel. Spotlight the theme park sector following much better than expected earnings from airlines. Brad, over to you. Let's kick things off with a check of the major averages here. 32 minutes into trading on this Friday and the Dow Jones industrial average right now. We're seeing that hold on to some slight gains right now. It's up by about 1.1%. All right, so a little bit more than slight gains here on the day than that is that composite as I bring this into an intraday view just to give us a better perspective of what's taken place. Look at that sharp move higher that we've seen within the first 30 minutes of trade. We're up by about half a percent right now as clearly investors, some of the sentiment right now is saying, hey, you know what, hold my beer. We could rally into this Friday and that's what we're seeing right now is a little bit of an early session rally. The S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 1% here. And so you take a look at the broader week that we've been watching as well. This could potentially add on to some of the net gains that we had seen, even with the declines earlier in the day. We were still up on the week by about 2% as of right now with this move. We're up by about 3% 3.3% on the S&P 500. Also want to take a look at some of the trending stocks on the Yahoo Finance homepage as well here. Yeah, it's none other than Snap, the brand of Ghost Face Chilla. Yeah, it's chilling on the day to the tune of about 30% chilling lower in a bad way here. So we're continuing to watch that as well as Twitter. You're also seeing shares of Pinterest move in constant lower by about 6.3%. So for more on this move that we've been tracking with Snap as I put that back in focus on the day down 30%. We've got Jeffrey's senior research analyst, Brent Thill Brent. Just take us into your reaction after you saw the numbers cross from Snap and what the executives had to say on the call last night. Yeah, good morning. The quarter itself was okay. It was the guy and they have obviously been experiencing decelerating growth just over a year ago. They said they could grow indefinitely for 50% and then the growth rate came into the 30s, into the teens, into the single digits and they exited at high single digit growth and then said the quarter was growing at 9% and then said the quarter would end flat because advertisers would fall off a cliff in the back half of the quarter. So I think it's more about the guide and more about it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,3,2022-10-21 14:05:50
3820," and said the quarter would end flat because advertisers would fall off a cliff and in the back half of the quarter. So I think it's more about the guide and more about the lack of visibility. There's clearly been a lot of departures, their senior leaders and sales have left to go to Netflix. You have a concern around advertisers moving to where the wallets are, meaning, the younger audience and staff don't have the dollars. The parents have the dollars. The older generation has the dollars. So you're seeing advertisers shift up from the lower end to the higher end, which makes sense. So we're still gonna be influenced to buy household goods and items for to run our life. But that's not where we make the decisions on SNAP, right? We may make a decision on SNAP to buy the new Hawaiian shirt or buy concert ticket, but we're not gonna be influenced to go again, make some of the bigger ticket purchases. So dollars for advertisers are shifting to Google, to Amazon, to prove and spend where the wallets are and that's where the advertisers are at. We also have a competitive issue with TikTok, which is anyone that's fired up TikTok and spend five minutes with it, spends a half hour with it, it engages you, it brings you in. So advertisers naturally in them or experimental and younger audience are shifting away from SNAP over to the TikTok platform. So there's a handful of forces, changes in the team, changes in advertisers. I think overall the bigger picture too is the macro, which is we have a macro picture that's dimming. We are going into a recession in 23 per hour economists. This will start later than most economists have believed our team internally continues to believe that we are going to go into it more of a tailspin in next year that this takes time to come out into the economy. So if you think about that, if we do go into that tailspin, we advertisers naturally, the first thing they're gonna say is we're not spending, right? Adversizing can be tuned up and tuned down in a nanosecond. We described as the stereo knob in your car or at home. You can go up and down really quick. You can't do that and software, you can't do that in semis, you can't do that in other areas of technology. So right now I think investors are just like, I don't want to be in advertising if we're going into a prolonged downturn. I will be back to advertising names when we go back in the upturn. And there's safer names outside of tech. And that's what we continue to hear from our clients is just our clients want to be outside of technology. Right now they want to be in energy. If you look at the XLE, you know, up over 50% year to date, right? So the popular trade beginning of the year was short technology belong, the XLE. And you know, we've got the XLE up again today and up 54% year to date. So I don't think that the tone of technology overall and advertising and many of the other tech names that we cover is going to shift until we get into 2023. We get a lot of these companies to really reset the numbers. So I expect a tougher earnings season for the rest of tech. Brent, does the snap have to cut its expenses even further? Yes, I mean, they do. I mean, they just restructured the company. They obviously are in the process of still reducing the workforce by 20%. They may have to go deeper. And again, I think the thing we don't know is how long is this economic pullback going to last? It could last all next year. Again, our Jeffery's own economists have said this really starts later in the year versus early because it takes time for all these changes that the Fed is putting into place is going to be a way that comes in slowly. It doesn't come crashing in on you. And so the scary part of what's happening is we don't know exactly that this can be prolonged. A lot of companies are saying, oh, we're not seeing it. Some companies are saying we're seeing it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,4,2022-10-21 14:09:58
3821," What's happening is we don't know exactly that this can be prolonged. A lot of companies are saying, oh, we're not seeing it. Some companies are saying we're seeing it. I think everyone's going to see it. I think this is going to be again, the concern, which is this could get a lot darker than we all think. That is a potential. Now, I would highlight that, look, if Elon Musk thinks that Twitter's worth $44 billion, and Snap now has a roughly $12 billion market cap, you start to ask yourself, he's trying to build the X app, which is all these things you can do. Snap has a closer version of an X app than anyone. It has the map, it has the information page, it has a messaging service, it has an ARVR, it has a gaming interface. I mean, there's many elements that investors have come back to me and said, if he wants to create an X app, which is all these things that Twitter isn't today and fire 75% of the workforce, doesn't snap how all the foundational makings of what an X app would look like. I'm like, yeah, absolutely. So at some point, you go, look, we understand they've had execution issues. Again, the visibility on the advertising industry, that's across the board. I mean, it's not like meta and Google and Amazon's ad business are accelerating. They're all decelerating, right? So they're all facing the same headwinds now. Obviously, Snap's had stronger headwinds. But at some point, you go back to everyone is so negative that ultimately, if you have a long-term horizon and you sit and look at this, and you believe, these are typically some of the best opportunities for tech investors over a three-year period, not the next three months. So depending on your duration, I think there's some credible opportunities that are being borne in this downturn that clearly, we're going to have some hazy, overcast foggy skies in the short term. But you're getting some interesting opportunities if you are a longer-term investor. Do you think there's some consolidation to be expected, given the valuations right now? 100%. M&A is going to massively spike. In M&A, there is no IPO window right now. So we have given birth to a lot of great technology companies. Many of these subsectors are overcrowded. You've already seen that. You're to date Tom O'Braw, who's one of the best software investors on the planet, is spent over $20 billion acquiring multiple companies outside in the security and technology landscape. So if you look out even outside of social media, you've seen incredible consolidation. You've seen strategic deals like Adobe buying Figma for $20 billion. No one thought any company in the beginning of a recession would pay 50 times revenue, 50, not 50. So we are going to see an incredible amount of strategic M&A, an incredible amount of private equity, led M&A. You're already seeing it. You're seeing the number of skyrocket, you're to date. You're seeing some of the best technology investors for the long haul, like Tom O'Braw will say, this is go time for software consolidation. There's no question. And this is what we need to restore the health, because we're in that cycle of we expanded dramatically. We had so many IPOs. We've had no IPOs intact this year. And so if you think about what's happening, you're going to go back to that natural consolidation phase of M&A. And we firmly believe we're seeing the signals already. We're seeing the best investors in the space talk about it. We're seeing the strategic step up and make acquisitions. You saw Adobe, you saw Microsoft in Activision. You've seen Salesforce go a little quiet. They have to go quiet in the short term. Intuitant that did MailChimp for 12 billion. You've seen an incredible amount. And so I think ultimately these valuations are going to get cheaper. This is when you want to be a choir. And if you're a strategic hero, private equity. Great perspective as always. Jeffrey, senior research analyst Brent, they'll have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. You do. Thanks. All right, before we head to break, let's take a look at some upbeat comments on Uber and Lyft at them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,5,2022-10-21 14:14:19
3822," Great perspective as always Jeffrey senior research analyst Brent they'll have a great weekend We'll talk to you soon. You do thanks All right before we head to break let's take a look at some upbeat comments on Uber and Lyft out of Deutsche Bank before each company reports earnings Analyst Benjamin Black says ride share demand backdrop for both Uber and Lyft remain strong explains black Our data comports with recent Uber management commentaries suggesting that ride share demand is beginning to follow typical seasonality Therefore we think the downside risks to ride share gross bookings for both companies is limited before we go to break though I will add this let's do a quick check of the markets here You're seeing the stocks really come out of the gate strengthen relative to the opening bell and Brad you flag this and It seems to be moving off of this the latest Nick Timrose market moving Wall Street Journal story Really I think for the first time Signally that the Fed pivot or that up time or that point where the Fed pulls back a little bit on raising rates by 75 basis points That might come in early 2023 perhaps quicker than some in the market expected yeah within this reporting Quote from Fed governor Christopher Waller from a speech earlier this month. However that Of course Fed whisperer that Nick Timrose has become that quote saying we will have a very thoughtful discussion about the pace of tightening at our next meeting here And that is really leaning further to some of this signaling even in a dendom to the Fed speak that we've gotten the signaling now That there may be some type of pivot in the markets certainly latching on to that here even that polar story can't turn around snap We'll leave it there we'll be right back You Walmart agreed to pay 215 million dollars to the state of Florida over claims that its pharmacies helped fuel the opioid epidemic in that state The retailer also agreed to give out 672,000 treatment kits to Florida first responders according to moody's Florida has now secured $3.2 billion to help fight the opioid crisis And a new report by doich bank sir says doich bank rather is laying off dozens of employees including some out of the UK That's according to voters. No concrete number was given but a person close to the matter says most of the cuts are in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit this as a pullback and financing deals prompted lenders to cut back on the call",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,6,2022-10-21 14:18:46
3823," Most of the cuts are in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit. This as a pullback in financing deals prompted lenders to cut back on costs. And Pfizer says it's hiking its US COVID vaccine price to over $100 per dose. Dosis could be costing between $110 to $130 per dose before insurance. Now this will take place after the US government's current purchase program expires. Right now the government pays around $30 per dose. And Adidas is cutting its full-year guidance following weaker demand in Western markets and its exits from Russia. The company cut currency, neutral revenue expectations, and lowered its expected operating margin to 4%. Adidas also blamed slowdowns in China and inventory buildups for the cuts. Despite the sour outlook, Adidas did see sales grow. 11% in Q3. All right from record home prices to record mortgage rates. 2022 has been a wild ride for the now ice cold housing market. But could this pain be good for prospective home buyers down the road? You'll find Ceeacombs, Rig Newman is here with more so. Rick, I should be cheering these declines because maybe at some point I'll be able to buy home. Maybe a year from now or something like that, but it's getting ugly in the housing market and it's probably going to get uglier. So we just saw the eighth consecutive month of declining existing home sales. That's the worst stretch since 2007 and what was happening in 2007. That was when the housing bubble was exploding. We got the home builders index this week. That has been going down. That's now at the lowest level since the bottom of the COVID downturn. And if you don't count that, it's the lowest level since 2012. Again, close to the bottom of the housing bust back then. So we have a long way to go to get through housing. Everybody has kind of seen this coming. I mean, this has almost everything to do with rising interest rates and mortgage rates now up around 7%. But we haven't seen prices really fall over yet. They've just started to turn and they will come down for sure. But we're at the beginning of a major correction and we probably have months to go. Rick, I like Saasie. Also just want to know when it's possible to buy a house. But I guess further out down the line, what kind of changes are we really expecting for the consumer environment to look like, especially given the fact that if you have an absence of those buyers because of rates in the near term that sellers as well are going to be impacted as well. And they're going to be less listings of existing homes. Yeah, this impacts everything on both the buyer and the seller side and the builder side I should add. So we're so builders are reluctant to build. We're seeing that decline. There's a long standing problem for builders getting permits. And you're right, there's this lock-in effect. So if you happen to be a homeowner and I'm lucky enough to be one, I'm older than you guys, of course. Then you probably locked in a mortgage rate of around 3%. And you're looking at this market in St. yourself. I'm not going to sell. I'm going to go out of my way to stay where I am and keep that to keep that where it is. So as with many other things we talk about on our area every day, we need to get to the other side of the Fed's tightening cycle. I think we need to see when that the Fed is finally feels like it's gone far enough. And then we can get through this difficult period. And you know, at some point, it's reasonable to think interest rates are going to come back down again. It might take a recession to do that. I mean, I've seen some economists saying, yeah, we think the Fed will basically finish up by late this year or early next year. And then it could be cutting rates again if we actually get into a recession in 2023. So, you know, things do change in the housing market, but these are long shifts. This is not like stocks. These are long shifts. We're talking six, nine, twelve months to we get to the other side of this. Congrats here, home ownership, Rick Newman. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Hi guys. It has been a year to forget and tech. As you can see by the unfolding nest, it's snappled. I've more into the space with Alphabet Board Member and former Goldman Sex Top Executive, Marty Chavez next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,7,2022-10-21 14:22:59
3824," This journey was almost completed. Second part is the second carriage. Now just walk through the Forest of Names. A first fermentation of 10 minutes will continue. The second worstphem is the final selection. I'm going to use a little bit of water. I'm going to use a little bit of water. I'm going to use a little bit of water. I'm going to use a little bit of water. The tech sector is firmly in the red and fraught regulation issues, layoffs and hiring freezes as inflation and market uncertainty take their toll on the sector. The tech landscape and global economic picture is six street partners. We've been talking all morning about this. The average investor understand what is happening and when will it end? I found it helpful as an investor and just for my own peace of mind to keep my eyes on the long term trends. There's a lot going on. I don't think I can add to it. There's certainly a lot of macroeconomic news. There's the announcement that we all read yesterday. I would just say this is the nature of tech. It is risky. It is growth. It is volatile. It has been on a very long trend and it was easy and fun to get used to that trend. Who knows where that's going to go in the future. But if you step way back and just look at the long term trend, I think there's very few predictions that I will make with absolute rock solid confidence. One of them is that there's going to be more software in the future than there is in the present. So long term is the same and there's a lot of ups and downs on the way. That prediction tracks Marty. Appreciate that here this morning. You also have a unique position of sitting on the board at alphabet as well. With that in mind, I just wonder what is the next transformative technology that's really going to be the changing factor for consumers and as well for some of the companies that we cover on a daily basis. So one thing that you get to say if you've been at the same thing for a long time is you live long enough to get to be considered a pioneer and so a long time ago. I was working on AI in medicine. This is back in the late 80s and the early 90s. The compute power was just way too low. And I remember back then there were people working on neural networks and we used to think, OK, that doesn't seem like that's ever going to work. Well, that has worked unbelievably well. So I many other people were just dead wrong about neural networks and what we are able to do we've all seen with neural networks is amazing. And we are just at the very, very beginning of an incredibly exciting up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,8,2022-10-21 14:27:36
3825," And what we are able to do, we've all seen, with neural networks is amazing. We are just at the very, very beginning of an incredibly exciting upswing and what we're gonna be able to do with AI across the board, whether it's drug discovery, climate change, or at the beginning of actually being able to do amazing, really miraculous things with AI. So that's the future, but right now, you're also kind of looking at this environment where even as we were looking at snaps, earnings and really reading through where they're impacted as a result of operating system privacy changes that many social media companies have been hit by because of the changes that Apple had put forward. There is another OS that's out there, in fact there are a few other ones and one of the other major competing ones is the Android OS. Why is it that there has been more of an impact to the social media companies derivative of privacy changes from the Apple operating system than from any privacy changes because there's also a privacy push within the Android OS as well? Well, I think all companies need to step back and the regulators doing this as well and look at what privacy means, how to define it and what we actually want and to get ready for it. And there's just a whole range of outcomes. This is a huge global social, political decision that we all have to make. And there's so many moving cards I'd love to predict it but I would just say to all companies, you have to ready yourself for a large number of different regulatory outcomes. Really, the question is, and we know what is possible with AI, what does society want us to do with it? And that is a very big decision that's happening right now. There's no one route. It depends on operating systems. It depends on policies. It depends on choices that consumers and companies make and nobody knows what's going to happen. So you just have to be ready for a variety of outcomes. Already, when the market gets a sense, the Fed is done raising rates for this cycle. What will that mean for the M&A market? Well, so I have somewhat infamous for not making timing predictions and I think I don't make them because I'm terrible at them, right? So, and also causality is hard like knowing this happens and that's going to happen next and predicting the timing of it. So right there is M&A happening. There are in every economy, including the one that we currently have, there are difficult spots and there are bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations of all kinds, in that area of AI, that is booming just like probably better than ever. Right? And so there are bright spots, green shoots even now in certain sectors and AI is certainly wonderful. Marty, we only got about 30 seconds left, but I'd love to know, especially as so many companies are making changes when it comes to diversity, equity, and inclusion, whether that be at the entry level, mid management, all the way up to the board. What is the step that a company can take right now in order to ensure that even in the midst of macroeconomic uncertainty, that they are retaining those values? Well, so the companies have the right values in that general, I don't know, I'm not gonna make a blanket statement, but really it comes down to what are you actually doing day to day in your recruitment and you're filling the pipeline in understanding connected to managing your people. And so companies are doing a much better job at the entry level, though it's still hard in reflecting the demographics of the cities and environments where they operate. Really the hard part is as people to become more senior in their careers, how do we continue to make them want to be here as opposed to some other place and how we actively manage their careers to mentorship and sponsorship? Those are the things that all companies need to be doing in a disciplined process oriented way every day through every market cycle. Sixth Street's partner and vice chairman, thanks so much for joining us. Marty Shavez, appreciate the time this morning. Pleasure, do well. Thanks.

3826," Here, the full interview with Verizon Wireless CEO, Hans Vesburg, on the other side of this short break-in on the back of his company's company's support. Verizon closing the books on its third quarter. It reported results before the bell and its stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investing in the company's support. Verizon closing the books on its third quarter. It reported results before the bell and its stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investors mold the report and weigh the impact of inflation on the wireless providers consumer business. I spoke to Verizon CEO Hans Vesburg earlier about the quarter. Take a listen. I think we came out from the second quarter. We had some softness in our consumer business, especially on the wireless. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter, especially around new plants, new products, but we also did some price adjustments. Coming into the third quarter and now reporting that, we can see some of that is really getting good effect. We're growing 10% or wireless revenue. Our EBITDA grew almost 3% to 12.2 billion dollars. So definitely the progress we put in place was actually working, but it's a lot more to do. We're a large company and we need to continue the hard work we're doing right now to continue to do the great cash generation we're doing. That was the highlight of the quarter. So we saw also the pre-paid market. We acquired a track fund last year, which added a really good asset when it comes to being in the value segment. We had a new product in there, a new product called Total Wireless, but Verizon. We also added home broadband to the pre-paid market. And overall our broadband had a really good quarter. 377,000 new broadband customers in the quarter across business and consumer. So that fixed wireless access business we're doing is really working. So a lot of things was working for us. We still are working on the consumer segment to be even stronger. And we're going to take more actions. It's a very agile market when it comes to consumer segment at the moment. We're going to talk a little bit more about that consumer segment as well, Hans. And from your perspective, when you think about what you had said at the end of the second quarter, mid-summer, second half challenges, you were kind of looking out into the future and saying that second half challenges, you see them as short term. Is that still the case? Or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer, especially as they're paying more?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,10,2022-10-21 14:36:27
3827," and saying that second half challenges, you see them as short-term. Is that still the case? Or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer, especially as they're paying more for necessities right now? And the macroeconomic climate that you believe might protrude into 2023 or even beyond? It's a little bit mixed feelings, actually. Evan, we have the highest quality custom base and the largest consumer base in the country. We see really good payment from our customers, consumers, where we are actually better than pre-COVID. So we don't see anything there. We actually see the roaming when people are traveling abroad. That movement are equally big or higher than pre-COVID. So a lot of things are moving as normal and our store traffic between Q2 to Q3, that increased with double digits. So people are actually doing movement. And then of course, we all read what's happening in the macroeconomy with higher inflation and the interest rates coming up. So it's a little bit mixed, but clearly, we are in the fundamental product. Everybody needs mobility. Everybody needs to be connected. That's so important for us. And even more important these days. So clearly, there are mixed feelings. We think we have a great product, we have a great network, and we are spanning all the consumer segment. And then don't forget our business side. That has a really good quarter with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the business group. But not only that, I did 200,000 new, almost 200,000 new net-dads, full net-dads in the business segment. So it's a little bit mixed when you read in the market and what we're seeing in our customer base. Certainly. I want to talk a little bit more about those network investments in a moment, but before that, we know that you're one of the largest partners with Apple in terms of the iPhone, the latest edition of this consumer device and the smartphone that comes out year after year. And within that, there's even been some of the reports around where the demand might be pulling back. Are you seeing that show up in your business at all right now? Now, when we come to the iPhone 14, the ones we have seen very normal volumes, but moreover, we actually made an exclusive deal with Apple, which we have done over a long time. We're Apple 1 for only limited. It's a new offering where you have all the Apple services, Apple Plus, the gaming, et cetera. In one package together, we are only limited. Very good for us to get it with Apple. So now we're very normal. There's a little bit of mix, of course, which type of products our customers are taking, but in general, very normal levels of a launch of an iPhone. If you were coming back to the network infrastructure investments that you're making as well, if we were to see any kind of recessionary concerns really permeate over into the next year, what would that mean in terms of the moderation of the level of network investments that you might be making? And perhaps on the other end, where are you full steam ahead? I think that the last six, seven years, we have the plan exactly how we're going to invest in the network. This is our peak year. We're going to do some somewhere between around 22 billion in Capex, that's our guidance. And that's one portion is our business as usual. And then the other is that the new spectrum we bought last year is actually coming to execution right now. And we're doing that as fast as we can. And next year, that will come down. But we have invested in fiber. We're investing in the C band, the spectrum we bought. We're going to pass 200 million pop in the first quarter on our C band. And the important with the C band, that's a five-d spectrum that we're using. We see good growth on that. So where we launch a market with the C band, we see mobility, business growing, we see fixed-wise access growing. And for the viewers, important, we bought that spectrum. But we get it all the time as those satellite companies are releasing it. And the last piece of that spectrum, we will get at the end of 2023. But basically, it's nationwide 160 megahertz, which is a lot of spectrum. And we're only deploying pieces of it right now. But by year and 2023, we'll have all. So we have a clear process of how we implement and execute in our network. And that's our number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for a network. We already have the best network. And it's just getting back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,11,2022-10-21 14:40:23
3828," implement and execute in our network. And that's on number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for the network. We already have the best network. And it's just getting better. So just lastly, while we have you here, I got a hustle to my finish here. But I'm taking a look at the stock price. Investors clearly reaction to this morning's earnings report. And perhaps they may be paying attention to some of the churn in end users or subscribers. But they also may be paying close attention to the margins as related to some of the capex that's going to be set forth and continues to be earmarked to the tune of $22 billion that you just mentioned. When do you believe either some of the churn will start to alleviate? And then on the other side, when you can start to adequately wind down perhaps some of the spending so that the margins aren't as compressed. So when it comes to our churn in the third quarter, that was expected. We took a deliberate decision in the second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments. And we knew that we would have a churn bubble. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took. And it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments. So that will ease over over time. So I think that's a very important message. And when it comes to the capex, we have a clear plan. We will come back, of course, with exact guidance for 23. But we have a very clear plan how we are on the peak level of spending right now. And then it will come down as we are spending as fast as we can and deploying the C band spectrum that we bought a year ago. All right. The Supreme Court has rejected a request made to block the Biden administration's program for student debt relief as has a district court. Yowell, fine, says legal correspondent Lexus Keenan has the latest Lexus. Hi, Brian. Yes. So two courts yesterday rejecting the request for emergency relief that would cancel the implementation of Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. Now, one was the Supreme Court request showed up there from a group of Wisconsin taxpayers. Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, she denied that request, not even taking up the matter on the merits at all. The other one came from a district court in Missouri. The Missouri case was brought by six Republican led states. They argued that Biden used Serpent Congress's authority to spend the taxpayers money. They also said that the relief plan jeopardizes the state's tax revenues, particularly revenue from the state run loan servicers that a lot of different states have across the country. The Wisconsin case for its taxpayers, it was brought by Brown County taxpayers near Green Bay, Wisconsin. That's the area. They made similar argument about Congress's spending power saying that Biden overstepped his bounds here. They also said that the president improperly invoked the 2003 Heroes Act that's really meant to give student debt relief to military members and their families. Now, the reason, though, that the state plaintiffs were denied this relief is because the court said they lacked standing as for the Wisconsin taxpayers and the Supreme Court's decision, we don't know the basis on which they denied this relief. It's because it's part of the Supreme Court's so-called shadow docket where it doesn't really go through the full briefing and hearing process that's given to those formal opinions that we've all been accustomed to. Now, there's a good chance, though, that standing was lurking behind the Supreme Court's decision. It's been a problem for all of the litigants that have tried to come forward to block this student loan relief. But I just want to give you a little lesson in what standing is. I think we have a full screen to show you what the plaintiffs have to the come to the table with in court is. They have to have a concrete injury. They have to have a injury that's very particular to them. It can't be an injury that's general to all. It can't be all taxpayers, for example. Also, that injury has to be an actual or imminent injury. It has to be happening right now. It can't be one that's hypothetical out in the future. Also, the injury has to be traceable to the action of the defendant named in the lawsuit. And also, it has to be something that the court can actually address, give redress to these so-called grieved plaintiffs. So the court saying here, both of these courts, all of the courts at this point saying, no plaintiffs, you do not have standing. We do not even have jurisdiction to hear this case. So what's next for the Republican states, they say that they're going to appeal the district court's decision for the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,12,2022-10-21 14:44:43
3829," do not even have jurisdiction to hear this case. So what's next? For the Republican states, they say that they're going to appeal the district court's decision for the Wisconsin taxpayers. They too are trying to appeal the seventh circuits, toss out of their lawsuit. So we'll be watching for that. Alexis King, thanks for breaking it all down for us. Appreciate it. All right, with airline earnings coming in hot, the theme park space may be worth another both fine investors more on this straight ahead. Yeah. The theme parks have had a rocky year as they look to bounce back from the lows of COVID-19. And our next guest says, estimate need to come down to a better reflect the challenges ahead. City Research Director James Hartman joins us now. James, good to see you again. We're right in the middle of a fright fest for six flags. And it's been a very frightful year for that company. They have really been struggling. How do you think this quarter shaped up? Yeah, I mean, and you're right. It has been a tough year for these guys. They had a new strategy where they're essentially aiming to have fewer customers, right? But the strategy that we know. That's not a good strategy. Here, please. We don't want to let you in. But take less business. We're okay with that. That's right. Well, we dubbed the Jerry McGuire strategy. You were customers more profits, better service. That may have made more sense come into this year. It's been a tough sell as some of these macro pressures have mounted. And so to answer your question, I do think it's a tough third. It was a tough third quarter for these guys. I think estimates probably are too high. I think attendance of anything. It was pretty bad in the second quarter. Anything there's a good chance that that got worse here in 3Q. James, for the lay person following this six-fledged story. And the CEO made some bizarre comments on that last earnings call. Push that aside. What is wrong with six flags? Is it the stands where they get the food? Are the rides not cool enough? Is it a combination of all that? Or is it just too expensive to go to these parks? Yeah, I think it's a combination of all of those things relative to other theme parks. Six flags has historically not been able to get the pricing that those others have and that they would hope to, particularly since they cater to some of the biggest cities in the US with some of the best disposable income. It tends to be a lot more teenager oriented as opposed to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,13,2022-10-21 14:49:16
3830," You know, some of the biggest cities in the US with some of the best disposable income. It tends to be a lot more teenager oriented as opposed to family oriented. And I think that plays a role in terms of the pricing that they're able to get. You know, there's an argument to be made that they haven't invested enough in their parks over the years. And that has also led to this sort of lower quality experience, at least that being the perception. And so I think that's all what predated this new concept that they ultimately had. They didn't put it this way, but that they fired their customers in a lot of ways. And you got to be real careful with that suffice at the second. That's bad news for the Dippin' Dot Barometer, James. When we think about some of the other major theme parks that are out there, I mean, what is going to be vastly different between this year and next year? This was supposed to be that travel demand boom year, that revenge experiential economy year. If not this year, then what does that shape up for next year for the theme parks? Yeah, it's such a great point. I mean, we were believers that there was this pent-up demand as we exited the pandemic for exactly these types of experiences. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of daylight between the post-pandemic phase or story and the pre-recession or recession story. And I think that's those two things ultimately, but it up against each other here in the summer of 22. I've got numbers lower for next year. We have seen pretty consistently over the course of the summer, slowing demand trends for the theme parks. Now, the good news is I do think that these companies, these businesses tend to hold in better, better than some of the other discretionary names that I follow. Right? And so they're going to feel it. I think attendance is likely to be down. Sales are likely to be down. But they generally hold in pretty well. And the reason for that is they tend to be trained down beneficiaries. Right? As opposed, once travel turns over, if in fact it does, these tend to be cheaper alternatives than going to Orlando or Mexico or Europe. James, what you often see in a lot of these theme park parking lots is when a Begos family take these when a Begos and they go to the theme parks. Now, that is the stock you cover. This company just reported earnings. Take us through their inventory situation. Are they able to get the semiconductors and the supplies they need to get these trucks or these mobile homes out of the showrooms and into the front porches or the dryways of customers? Yeah, I mean, so that was the narrative for so much of 2021 in the early part of 2022. Could they get this supply out there because there was very much to believe that true demand was better than these reported retail numbers? IE, if you had more product, you could sell more product. I think that narrative has changed over the past three months and, and oh, by the way, I don't think it's just for Arby's. I think the ability to stock showroom floors has improved dramatically. And if you want to get one of these, you can get one of these right now. I think that the it's a double head sword now though. The concern is that these manufacturers will pump up the channel too much with some of these inventories. And that would ultimately turn make a bad situation worse as we think about a potential recession. And again, it's not just Arby's. I think this whole debate as to are we are aren't we heading towards a recession? In what I cover, right, big ticket discretionary. In a lot of ways, it feels like we're there or or fastly quickly approaching that place. It does seem like over the past few months. Supply has improved, but the man has not. All right. Well, for those of us brining myself included who are priced out of the housing market. The RVs are looking to be good. I'm Neil Baby. City Research Director James Hardman, thanks for taking the time here today. Have a great weekend. Thanks, guys. Guys, coming up, we're going to do a roundup of the top things that we've heard this week from some key business leaders, from everything from our all-market summit to kick off the week through to, yeah, today's conversations with some big CEOs as well. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,14,2022-10-21 14:53:19
3831," We will begin the beetle method. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance, everyone. It was an energizer bunny type of week here for us here on the morning show as we spoke with a numerous amount of executives, including CEOs from Bank of America. We had proctor and gamble, target or tarjet, and Hilton all seeming to be optimistic surrounding recession chances, and the current state of the consumer here's what they had to say. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief is a mild recession. So purely from a consumer demand and willingness to span the standpoint, we wouldn't predict a recession. The hope is, it allows the Fed, at some point over the next six or 12 months, to sort of stabilize having done their job with inflation, more in a control, and allow the economy to get its footing again and start a process of re-acceleration. They continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays, and we know they're out on the streets of New York, they're in restaurants, they're in our stores, so right now we're seeing a stable environment. So there was a ton to really be extrapolated from those conversations, whether it was during our all market summit to kick off the week, or even later on as we moved through Ernie season, but particularly one of the threads was where the Fed policy is going to continue to actually impact the consumer in this near term, and what that actually does for the economy to change the demand profile or the demand cycle that we find ourselves in as relates to these companies' financial performance. Yeah, we talked about it earlier, Brad. I think we got a taste to that in that really major profit warming for a whirlpool. Again, those are big ticket purchases that you put on credit cards, heard it from Generak earlier in the week, but what is interesting, I'll just call up Target as well, Brian Cornell, Chairman and CEO, telling us he's a stable business, but how stable is it next year? Let's say there's a Target store next to Snap headquarters or where Snap employees work. They just missed their quarter because of pressure on online spending because the economy is slowing down. That person now lost their job. Are they still spending at the same rate after this holiday season at a target that they were this year? Unclear, which speaks to the bigger thing, this is a very challenging Ernie season. It is really hard to truly understand what is going on inside corporate America. It's a hard Ernie season, but at the same time for us and the conversations, I mean, the questions that we're asking are definitely trying to just get a different sense of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,15,2022-10-21 14:57:58
3832," It's a hard earnings season, but at the same time for us and the conversations, I mean, the questions that we're asking are definitely trying to just get a different sense of where there actually is some of that vulnerability, how they're managing through that, and then on the other side of that, what kind of company is emerging on the other side of that economic downturn or macroeconomic challenge that continues to be cited here? More big convose to come next week. Well, that is it for myself and Brad. Coming up, Akiko Pajito will speak with two analysts about the state of the semiconductor sector. You won't want to miss it. Thank you. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Friday to all of you. It's 11am here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Snap, crackle, flop. Shares of the social media company plummet. As declining ad revenue and widening losses weigh on investors, we're going to discuss the numbers and implications for wider tech. Musk underscrew me. The Biden administration reportedly considers national security reviews for the Tesla CEO as questions swirl around foreign investors involved with the Twitter buyout. Ship disruption, new US tech controls threatened to shake up the global semiconductor industry. As companies scramble to be in compliance, we've got a paddle standing by for you to discuss the implications. First though, let's check in on the market action. We are 90 minutes into the trading day, of course, trying to round out the week here on a positive note. We've got the Dow up 151 points. The S&P 500 up nine. The Nasak, the only one in the red. The yield on the 10 year treasury note, one to really note today, climbing to a level we have not seen in 14 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,16,2022-10-21 15:02:14
3833, 100 up 9 the Nasdaq the only one in the red the yield on the T tenure treasury note want to really note today climbing to a level we have not seen in 14 years we also saw a big jump in the 30 year yield but we've seen a bit of a pullback off the highs in part because of some of the comments that we have gotten from Fed officials there's that Wall Street Journal report that came out that pointed to potential concerns within our monk Fed officials about over tightening and how aggressively they're moving that could be partly what we're seeing the levels right now but the tenure yield still at 4.24% moving on to our top story of the hour it is all about snap and take a look at where shares are trading right now down more than 30% following its miss on revenue estimates for the third quarter the social media company citing continued deceleration of revenue growth as a result of ongoing challenges that include platform policy changes macro economic had wins and increased competition joining us now for a snapshot of the path ahead for staff we got Jason healthstein up in high-mer managing director and head of internet research Jason you know this certainly was not a great quarter but this is a steep fall for this company shares are down more than 30% how much of this you think is overdone I think the challenges investors are kind of estimates I'll do they want to support this company longer term I think one of the questions we get from investors is you know will they ever put ads in messaging I think it's pretty well known we all know we use all of us use messaging products right and we generally don't see ads and messaging products and so and a lot of this company's use case is at the messaging tool right when they do then try to take that activity and get you to spend time using spotlight and using discover but they're also seeing a kind of competition there from TikTok and others and so when you couple together the 5% decline in U.S. time spent with kind of revenue that was below expectations and and currently trend that investors are having a really hard time to cybery you know I think you're having investors trying to decide do they want to underwrite the stock longer the company longer term Jason there are two key issues that have really persisted from quarter to quarter this year one is of course that the slowdown that we've seen in ad spending to the point you just made also the other one is about this company being able to navigate these changes that have taken part as a new as a result of the privacy guardrails that are now in place through apples I.O.S. I mean this is not these are not new problems that came up during this quarter and I wonder if you think we've taken away anything more based on that earnings call yesterday about how much worse things are about to get particularly for snap yeah we think kind of the apple privacy is is is a good excuse but not the main reason that really only affects for the most part app downloads or advertisers trying to drop downloads the bulk of snapchats advertising is brand advertising and and that's what's been bouncing around kind of month a month in kind of an unpredictable way so and they're telling you that they they expect their brand advertising to slow as they move through the quarter right and so I just that is that is the kind of the issue and then they're also telling you that effectively competition is still a threat to time spent and so this quarter you saw impressions slowed not a ton they were up 8% item of ads sold versus nine for the last quarter but then price brand was down three versus up four in the second quarter and they're kind of telling you that they think those metrics will slow right expecting basically flat revenue growth in the back half and you know it's not the fourth quarter and it's not all currency currency was about two points of headwind so there's definitely you know I'd say more companies specific factors obviously will know more next week when alphabet and metta report but we don't expect kind of as bad of an outlook from metta because they will be comparing against what was a challenging period last year well and let's pick about that point because when you look at the other social media stocks they are following today in tandem with snap not to the levels that we're seeing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,17,2022-10-21 15:06:20
3834," Following today in tandem with snap not to the levels that we're seeing in terms of declines in the snap stock But alphabet you mentioned meta Pinterest another one that's been coming down as well We've learned in the last quarter that you know it this is this isn't snap isn't always a bellweather partly because these other names Are a little more diversified. I mean what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen? Who's best position to write out the macro headwinds? Yeah, I mean to to your point, you know, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized Obviously not not as bad as a snap is but kind of down, you know four or five six percent depending on the company We actually do like meta the best right now For playing digital advertising within large cap in front of the quarter Mostly because they already took their longs a year ago, right? So they were the most impacted by Apple privacy changes They call that a 10 percentage point kind of impact to them They also benefited the most during the pandemic from the poll forward in e-commerce spending and e-commerce advertising and that has unwound as we As the economy is reopened if you look at the monthly data on retail sales e-commerce isn't growing any faster than overall retail sales So that's kind of telling you that they're still kind of like a hangover there And so we think as that starts to obey and you've easier calms we think the setup is is pretty good for meta And then the last thing is we are waiting for Apple to kind of update. It's called SCAD Network 4.0. It's the next technology tool to improve Tracking of ads and and performance data and we think meta is the best position company to take advantage of that for their advertiser So we are optimistic on meta in front of the quarter Okay, well, we're watching for those numbers when they come out next week Jason healthstein Oppenheimer managing director and head of internet research appreciate the time Thank you Well, let's not turn to the broader markets. We've got fed officials now moving forward towards another rate hike of point 75 percentage points at the November meeting We've got Yahoo Finance as Jared liqueur is always on top of this and yield certainly been the focus of the week But yet again today we're talking about a level we haven't seen in 14 years Yes, and let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive. I'm plotting the US dollar index We're going to circle around the currencies in a second because what we're talking about in terms of bonds very closely link with currencies And there are spillover effects into equities everything is linked here So here's a US dollar index appreciated 17% versus this basket of currencies Mainly weighted towards a euro, but very illustrative of what's been going on here Here's a 10 year Tino yield it looks very similar to that US dollar chart In fact, they're very correlated hitting 4.22 percent now it has backed off a little bit higher number than that But as you said at Keiko most of these bond yields we have not seen since 2007 through 2011 I can put you I can show the five year That's down nine basis points a 30 year that is up base eight basis points So we have a lot that's happening with the yield curve right now and essentially it has been flattening And let me just point you I'm going to put up the US dollar one more time here and I have some comments from Nordia that I want to go over because we are caught in an effects Loop here and this has to do with respect This has to do with the Bank of Japan now Nordia is taking a look at this countries are saying do not have an endless amount of US dollars at disposal to sell Meaning that effects intervention will fail when the US dollar coffers run dry This is from the perspective of these central bankers over in Japan They have amassed a war chest of US dollars. They also hold 1.2 trillion dollars in US treasuries very important here So Nordia going on to say more over effects intervention involves selling US treasuries That's to get US dollars which adds upward pressure on US rates That's because rates are inverse to bond prices stick with me one more second here This leads to a stronger US dollar in isolation this affects intervention intervention US US dollar doom loop doom loop illustrated here I'll show you the picture in a second could lead to dollar overshooting especially when central banks are enforcing the loop So here we go weaker yen sales of US treasuries higher US dollar rates weaker yen and the cycle continues And that's what we've been seeing here And this the spillover effects as I mentioned with respect to equities These de leveraging actions right here. We're not going to see a bit on equities until all of this is done",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,18,2022-10-21 15:10:42
3835," And this, the spillover effects, as I mentioned with respect to equities, these leveraging actions right here, we're not going to see a bit on equities until all of this is done. And the central bankers have been very flat-footed about the response so far. Yeah, the BOJ in even tougher position given the data we got today, right? Eight-year high inflation, not at the level that we're seeing in the US, but still, they've got a very dovish policy in place. They've got the yen continuing to weaken against the dollar, and then now that they're looking at we didn't get to it, but the yen very volatile today, maybe an intervention that we don't know about going on right now. Okay, something to watch, thanks so much for that, Jared. Well, at the time now for our trending ticker, and we are seeing weaker than expected subscriber numbers weighing on shares of Verizon. That stock is down more than 6% hitting a 52-week low today. The largest wireless carrier added just 8,000 monthly subscribers in the most recent quarter. As competitors offered aggressive promotions to take away market share, that prompted Verizon to offer its own discount and introduce low-cost mobile phone service and internet plans. There's what CEO Hans Westberg had to say on customer terms this morning. We took a deliberate decision in a second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments, and we knew that we would have a show in Bobbill. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took, and it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments, so that will ease over all the time. So I think that's a very important message. Broadband proved to be a bright spot for the quarter for Verizon. The company added another 342,000 wireless home internet customers in the quarter. Well, coming up, the result season is stealing the headlines this week, but investors keeping a very close watch on the bond market as the 10-year treasury yield hits levels we haven't seen in 14 years.

3836," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Carker says the Central Bank is not quite finished raising its target rate as inflation remains stubbornly high. Meanwhile, a fresh report in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests some Fed officials are signaling unease with big rate rises. So is this the first sign of the long-awaited pivot? Do you want to guess the discusses Emily Roland Co. Chief Investments for as just a John Hancock investment management? Emily, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on this report that came out from the journal today about the debate that's happening in whether you in fact think that the data that we have gotten, the latest data points to the need for at least a pause in the hikes. Yeah, the volatility in the rate market today has been nothing short of astonishing. You know, we woke up to this continued backup and interest rates have been playing out over the last few days and then this, you know, journal article comes out suggesting that potentially the Fed is going to be leaning towards 50 basis points in December instead of 75 or at least discussing that at the November Fed meeting here. So, you know, we think that that it's right to consider a pause and you even heard Lail Brainerd earlier about a week ago talking about the fact that, you know, maybe we are a pause is potentially warranted here as some of the monetary policy decisions start to really work their way into the economy and it's important to recognize that Fed policy works the long and variable lag. The Fed just started tightening in March of this year and they've implemented the most aggressive amount of tightening that we've seen in the generation in a really, really short amount of time. We want to watch to see how that actually filters into the economy before the Fed just continues down this path of aggressive tightening. How much of that have we actually seen filter through the economy based on what you've seen? Well, we look at the leading economic indicators and we just saw another negative readings. We've had three negative readings in a row here for the leading indicators and that's the gest that we are in a significantly decelerating economic growth climate. The challenges is that the Fed uses by nature of their mandates lagging economic data. So, they're looking at the fact that the unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent near a 50 or low. They're looking at CPI data which just continues to be and they're a big component of that of course is the housing market shelter which tends to be a very sticky component of inflation. It takes time to show up in the data and the Fed is marching down this path of dampening inflation really at any cost but that's the key question at what cost and they're looking like they're going to keep going until something breaks. I mean the other big challenge of course comes down to messaging and that's been a bit tricky when you think about how things played out over the summer. Now we know that the Fed officials didn't feel like the markets were simply getting the message. We got that very strong message at Jackson Hole. Since then it's sort of been we're going to continue to hike rates until inflation comes down. How do you think they told the line here? If in fact there is some kind of pause to at least message to the markets this doesn't mean a pivot. This is just a slowdown. It's such a great question because the messaging and the forward guidance is so critical and one of the things we learned from the journal article this morning was that the Fed wants to be careful in avoiding a big upside move in markets based on this perceived Fed pivot. So I think if they do decide to go with 50 in December it's going to be well telegraphed whether it's through the Wall Street Journal or some other mechanism because we saw that incredible rallying soft to play it out from mid-June to mid-August for your point there and it was based on this false hope that the Fed was going to reverse course in quick fashion and clearly that's not the case and they've made it quite clear that they're going to keep the gloves off and the fight against inflation until the fight is done. Bottom line Emily as we look ahead to the next few months and what does that mean from an investment standpoint does this change at all in terms of your thesis on",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,20,2022-10-21 15:19:21
3837," Emily, as we look ahead to the next few months, and what does that mean from an investment standpoint? Does this change at all in terms of your thesis on where things are headed? Or is this also a time to maybe pause and wait to see where the economic debt elites? Yeah, I mean, investors are feeling really specific right now as this volatility picked up, and we're suggesting to them that they should focus on the horizon, which to us really means looking at the income on high-quality bonds as something that's pretty competitive versus the other alternatives out there. We used to talk about China. There's no alternative. And what we meant a couple years ago that given the fact that bond yields were so low, there was no other alternative but to buy stocks. And we would argue today that there is no alternative to bond. Yes, price pressures are there, but the fact that you can get five, six percent income on high-quality bonds right now, we think it's awfully competitive. You look at the dividend yield on the S&T 500, which is less than 2%. So we want to move up the capital structure. We want to get paid income as we wait out this more challenging macro backdrop. Some good takeaways there. Emily Roland, Co-Chief Investment Stragist at John Hancock Investment Management. Good to talk to you today. Thank you. Well, there's even more trouble for Elon Musk ahead. The US government reportedly considering whether it should review Musk's newfound empire. That includes his ongoing deal for social media site Twitter and SpaceX's satellite network. Let's bring, we should report, is according to Bloomberg. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, is Alexis Keenan, who's tracking this. Alexis, let's start with what's happening with Twitter because this is an interesting one given that the concern is really about who's part of this investment group for Twitter, that there are foreign players in here that could potentially signal a conflict. Right. So what Bloomberg is reporting is that US officials in the Abadan administration are concerned about the Twitter deal to the extent that it has foreign investors, including the Saudi Arabian prince Al Wali Bintalal, as well as Binance, which has a Chinese founder and has backing from Cutters' sovereign wealth fund. So that's where they're saying that according to sources, there are maybe some concerns. Now, they also go on to say that it's not really clear which agency would originate this kind of inquiry, but one of the usual suspects is CIFIAS, that's the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. That committee in 2018 was given a lot of expanded authority to conduct these types of threat assessments over possible security concerns that arise from foreign investment in US companies. And they even got expanded authority to look at those multi-national deals that result in less than foreign control, which was the former case for the agency, especially they got some authority to look at investments that involve companies that are engaged in technology and personal data. Of course, the Twitter deal would qualify, I would think, perhaps, under that standard. Now, the idea that the security review of a security review at all based on national security concerns, it's been raised previously with respect to Tesla, with respect to SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. But it's the first time we're hearing about it, raised with respect to the Twitter deal, that's certainly sparking a lot of questions about the, whether the government could end up derailing this deal and certainly part of that contract for the merger between the two companies. It does require that it surpass any regulatory and government review. So that's getting a lot of talk here. Elon Musk already tweeting that in response to this Bloomberg piece saying commenting on a Twitter post that said it would be hilarious if the government ended being the one to derail this tie up between Twitter and Musk's companies that he's formed in order to effectuate this merger. Really quickly, Alexis, any of us who've followed these syphias reviews in the past know that this is never a quick turnaround. And we are talking months and months and months of review. If in fact that's triggered, what does that mean for the deal? Well, Akiko, syphias can take a look at transactions that are already, that are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,21,2022-10-21 15:23:42
3838," view. If in fact that's triggered, what does that mean for the deal? Well, Akiko Sifius can take a look at transactions that are already that have already happened. So they can go back and try to get some agreements from companies that have already done the deal. So it doesn't necessarily stop the deal from going forward, but the government could also intervene and say we would like to have some things ironed out before it does commence. So we'll certainly be watching the deadline that the court has put on the deal, which is October 28th next Friday, one week from today. But look, yes, it could go on for a very long time, these types of inquiries, but it doesn't mean that it just stops the deal and it's tracks. Okay, thanks getting a little more complicated there. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, upscale electricity. If you like trucks and want something like a hummer, then not exactly a hummerable GMC might have the thing for you. Yacht Finance is probably supermanium is going to have the story for us on the other side. The competition in the EV space is revving up. General Motors unveiled its latest electric truck yesterday, the 2024 GMC Sierra EV. It's now taking reservations for the $107,000 fully loaded version called the Sierra EV Denali Edition. Thankfully, we've got a supermanium to break down all the details for us. That is a hefty price tag, but it's not the only truck on the market. That's an EV. How does it compare? Well, you know, it's, it's twin is basically the silver auto, the Chevy Silverado, which I find to have a design that's more adventure lifestyle truck. Whereas if you look at the the new Sierra EV over here, it's more traditional truck like, looks like a work truck. I think it might have peeled to a broader set of people. Power.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,22,2022-10-21 15:28:15
3839," or lifestyle truck whereas if you look at the new Sierra EV over here it's more traditional truck like, looks like a work truck, I think it might have peeled to a broader set of people. Power wise it actually has more power than the top of Lancelot Brado, it has around 750 horsepower, 400 miles of range in that top trim, so that's pretty competitive. But you did mention that price, $107,000 for that top tier, it's very pricey, very high and very premium I would say. But I did get a chance to speak to the chief engineer, Nicole Crats about lower trim levels that are actually going to compete against the Ford Lightning Pro. Here's what you'd say. $2000 model for the Sierra EV is an elevation, it's an elevation trim so it's not a work truck in the in the standpoint of a model named a work truck or a fleet truck if you will. We're bringing some really compelling capability from a basic perspective on the Sierra EV into all price points. The trucks are capable of different ranges and different option contents. So the Sierra EV Denali that we're talking about for 2024 with our edition one is a fully loaded full all of the technology that we can possibly imagine. And then in the future, you know, many of these things become options and then various range picks as well available. So it really brings an EV pickup for everyone. I mean, we talk about that and people kind of think that's a little cliche perhaps, but we are really committed to bringing folks into our EVs, specifically in the EV pickup truck segment. And by offering them, you know, all of the capability and all of the technology that they desire, we can, you know, establish to these various ranges of our price points as well. So we don't have the spexy up for that elevation from that base model, but we do know that the Sierra Denali EV one that high end one is going to come out in 2024 with the lower terms coming out in 2025. So how does this compare to the gas powered Sears? And is that the exact target they're going for in terms of who's likely to switch over? Well, I think with the lower terms, they're going to know if they do stick with that $50,000 price set, which is, as you know, these things have been changing, that would be comparable to a Sierra work, elevation work truck at that, I shouldn't say, workshop at that trim level, it would be comparable price wise, and even have a bit more power. But the question is, are you going to be able to convince these guys who drive traditional trucks? I want to, I want to EV with potentially less than 400 miles of range. And then I'm going to take the job site, is that going to be as, as capable and sturdy as my traditional gas power can go anywhere sort of thing. So I think that's the big sort of question that GM is trying to answer or how their clients or customers answer. Yeah, still a lot of concerns about range, about infrastructure, charging stations, making sure that's all in place. Right, right. So they can drive it just like they would know normal. Right. I do want to add one thing that it does have the GM, kind of like the ability to power a work site, power your home, and also power the grid, potentially with their GM energy products. So that will work with that with the ultimate battery pack. So they do have that additional capability that you might not find in like a ravine, for example. Yeah, and that would benefit there. All right. Thanks so much for that, Pras. Well, coming up the eternal push and pull, it's been another choppy week for crude oil, prices, which in higher now is recession fear, take a back seat to hope over renewed finance demand that conversation is going up next. So tools now",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,23,2022-10-21 15:32:36
3840," Nothing. What we are seeing crude setting to finish off what has been a very choppy week. His investors look ahead to earnings from the oil majors, given growing suppliers in places like Libyan recession fears, though, question is where prices headed. For more on that, let's bring in Mohammad Darwazah. He's senior analyst of macro energy at energy aspects. I'm Mohammad, good to talk to you today. I want to start with the demand that we've been looking at over in China. Of course, we started off the week at the party congress that's now wrapping up and the expectation was maybe we'd get some signaling on whether in fact China would sort of back off on the zero-COVID policy, which has led to a lot of concerns about the demand coming out of there. What do you see in terms of how things are likely to shape up in the next few months? Yeah, thank you for having me. I think you're absolutely right. There may be had been some expectations building up that post party congress, China would start moving away from zero-COVID. I think what has been clear is that actually a lot of these lockdowns have come into effect ahead of the party congress in anticipation or sort of expectation that policy will begin to shift over the next sort of three to six months. I think the market has now kind of caught up with the view that this is unlikely to change imminently, but I think going forward, there is an expectation that COVID rules are going to begin to be relaxed. China has been somewhat absent from the buying cycle, include markets over the past year or so, and I think once China does come back, this is going to be certainly a bullish factor. The next marker, a lot of investors certainly looking ahead to, is in December when we see those sanctions come down on Russian oil, we're looking at where prices are tracking today. It certainly looks like at least some of those recession fears have subsided a little. How are you looking at where things are right now for talking Brent Critt at 92.88 in the context of what's to come? Yeah, absolutely. I think obviously a lot of uncertainty going into your end, and this is kind of cast sort of a cloud over the market. The EU embargo on Russian crude and products that set to come in in December of this year and in February of next year, I think ultimately will have a significant impact on Russian production. We expect Russian production to drop by an average of about a million barrels a day, sort of by the end of Q1 of next year. More generally, I think prices will be kept going forward because of demand fears, because of concerns around recession. We are expecting quite a deep recession in Europe, a much shorter and a shallow one in the United States. And I think ultimately, the X factor here is really China. So much of the concern in the oil markets have been shaped around the supply concern. You mentioned demand concern. Is that what's going to be driving prices going into your end?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,24,2022-10-21 15:36:55
3841," So much of the concern in the oil markets have been shaped around the supply concern. You mentioned demand concern. Is that what's going to be driving prices going into year end? And what are some of those risks that we're overlooking? Yeah, I mean supply, I think the market does spend a lot of time looking at supply. Supply is constrained. This is a structural issue. I think people are coming around to that view. And I would say it's a lot more sort of divergence in the market in terms of expectations. And in times of recession, we tend to see commodities and late cycle sort of sell off. And this is no different. But when we look at sort of the highs of the year, we have come off and we're about 20 ish percent from this year's highs. Okay. We'll be watching a lot of people watching to see where those prices track. Mohammed Darwaza, senior analyst of macro energy at energy aspects. Thanks so much. Thank you for your time. Well, the cost of Pfizer's COVID vaccine is going to quadruple after the current purchase program expires in the U.S. Earlier this week, Julie Heimins spoke to the company CEO Albert Borla about pricing. Here's what we have to say. The vaccines will be priced based on their cost effectiveness. And the cost effectiveness is multiple of what it is right now. The price when we give to the governments in the pandemic. We have the finance senior health reporter, Anjali Kamlani here, to break it all down for us. How big of a surprise is this sort of an expected thing? This is an expected thing. The number is the part that's new. So 110 to 130. That's what the news that we just found out. And that's from an analyst call yesterday that Pfizer had. And I want to dig down into the details because it is important to understand what's baked in to this pricing. It's things like the cost of a single dose vaccine packaging. It's the fact that they're now going to be distributing through multiple sources rather than just through the government and through that single channel of the distributor and the mailing and delivery service and transportation. That all goes away once the government contract ends. And so what they're looking at is early Q1, or sorry, late Q1, a so earlier next year is when they're looking to really transition more into this commercial environment that also includes, by the way, the discussion about the cost and whose paying for it. It's going to be borne by insurers. And so most Americans won't really be impacted by this price shift. But it's important to point out that Pfizer did note that the uninsured are going to be taken care of in a quote. They said, eligible UL residents without insurance will be able to access the COVID-19 vaccine for free. So that stays in place as well through their current programs, that assistance programs for patients. So all that put together really, you know, paints a picture of an expected commercial market, the price itself is not outrageous. We do know that there are vaccines within that price range over $100. So like you said, not really unexpected. Okay. Speaking of COVID, there are reports of more lockdowns in China. I'm just looking at this number here in terms of where things have stood since March. China is partially or fully locked down 152 cities. Yes. Since March. Effecting 280 million people. So what's the very latest? Taking down even further, 114 of those have been since August alone. So let's talk about what we've really talked about this week. We know that Beijing announced select lockdowns in the major city Thursday, Genjo on Monday. And then we also know, Shionn, today, got some more lockdowns in those areas. So really some key metropolis that are being affected right now. That's why we're hearing a little bit more about this. But it's important to note that it's not entire lockdowns for the most part. And that's what's different this time around. We know that previously we'd seen really major district wide, city wide lockdowns. But the impact has been, you know, that we've seen a struggle for the country in terms of being able to plan. They've been switching announcements. So for example, in the Genjo area, they didn't necessarily impact the Foxconn plan or that Apple plan, the iPhone manufacturing plan. But the company itself did put in restrictions for a dining area. So we're seeing some of that movement, Macau, for example. That's another thing that's being hit, right? We know that there has been some impact from what the overall China lockdowns have had. So Macau has seen a decline almost 50% slow gaming revenue in September. So all of this like broader impacts of just these.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,25,2022-10-21 15:41:06
3842," China lockdowns have had. So Macau has seen a decline, almost 50 percent slow gaming revenue in September. So all of this, like broader impacts of just these select targeted lockdowns. And I mean, you know better than I do about what this means for the party and just what the future means for what it means for. I mean, you wonder if China is now sort of taking this approach of being a little more selective on how or where aggressively they move largely because the impact it's had on the economy. We're talking about what anywhere from high to 3 percent growth this year, as well below the target. You get the sense from the party congress, they sort of accepted the slow growth, but any further slowdown, you'd imagine would still be a big concern. It would be, I mean, this is impacting poor cities, this is impacting transportation. It's all going back to the question of where does the world's maker, right, manufacturing hub, stand when it comes to continuing this many years later. We've seen, you know, here in the US, of course, is a bad comparison, but complete opposite, right? We've let go of so many mitigation measures. And by comparison to what they had early on in the strict lockdowns, this is definitely more targeted and that requires more focus on the local government. So the party has really left it up to the local governments to decide, but it is still part of that zero-covid policy or dynamic zero policy. Well, into your point worth noting because there is a trickle effect, whether it's in, you know, devices being manufactured, they're a pair of makers. I mean, it really is the hub, and that has an impact in the US, in Europe all over. So, story that I know you're going to see on top of coming up on the other side, the next battleground. Semmy conductors have been described as the new oil, but we'll have the firmest grip on the market. I'm going to go in fight to secure production.

3843," What is time now for today's chart of the day and we're focusing on semi-conductors as a key indicator of economic trouble ahead. This chart from Bloomberg compares the performance of the beaten down semi-conductor sector with another one on a downward trend and that's ISM new orders. The analyst behind the chart suggests the correlation doesn't necessarily mean a deep recession is imminent but the two trending in the same direction makes the compelling case for a downtrend. The semi-sector is down more than 40% this year outpacing the S&P's 20% decline. Well, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reportedly met with leading semi-conductor companies over the past week seeking to assess the fallout for the Biden administration's chip restrictions on China. The administration now also reportedly exploring the possibility of new export controls to limit China's access to emerging computing technologies. What could all this mean for the path forward in the semi-sector? Let's bring in Daniel Newman, his future on research principle analyst. We both have got Edith Young, race capital general partner here to break it all down for us. Edith, I want to start with you because I think it's worth noting an interesting set that you have put out here in terms of what this exactly means. When you look at it, China consumes more than 75% of the semi-conductors globally but produces only about 15%. We have heard so many reports since the administration came down with these tech controls about not just panic but just full-on reassessment happening. What are you hearing from those on the ground? I think right now what China is trying to ask sex is if the intent from the US government is to make sure that China cannot even buy or produce or even maintain what does that mean and this actually could impact many, many industry. We're not just talking about computer or smartphone, EV. There's all sort of industry actually really need this chipset to continue to run. I don't think there is a conclusion yet but what I'm worried about that if China really wants to be as aggressive as the US and retaliate, there could be a lot of impact for all the other companies in the US and I think this is beyond just impact in terms of revenue for Intel or Qualcomm or Nvidia or of course we need to watch out for TSMC but if they retaliate in other industries this is going to be disastrous. And we'll get to the impact on some of those companies in just a bit but really follow up here, Eda, what's the capability of these Chinese companies to be able to be self-sufficient when you're talking about advanced chips? So for the fast few years President Xi is trying very hard to make sure that China as a country can be independent from buying from Nvidia, Intel or Qualcomm but I think personally I think it's still very far away to get to that level. I don't think China is self-sufficient yet even though the TSMC, SMIC is sort of the TSMC for China but they're still far ahead in terms of what is being produced locally. Daniel Zediff highlighted, I mean these as in the companies in China are major customers for American chip designers, chip makers too. There's an interesting report that BCG put out a few years ago that said that full tech control as in a complete ban could lead to upwards of 40% drop in revenue for some of these big names in the US. How are you assessing that impact right now? Yeah I think we got to look at the more broad economic story of what's going on here. I think President Xi Jinping has been very declarative about the intention of China to be the leading designer and manufacturer of leading edge semiconductors. The US has put a massive investments with the CHIPS Act to take more control of its own fate and its supply chain. We have a lot of microaggressions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,27,2022-10-21 15:49:39
3844," US has put a massive investments with the CHIP's act to take more control of its own fate and its supply chain. We have a lot of micro-aggressions going on in the South China Sea. And right now, this is one of the things China is very dependent on US intellectual property and engineering capabilities in order to manufacture these leading edge chips. So a lot of this is focused on things like AI, high performance computing, which are going to not only enable innovation in, as our other guests said, in smartphones and EVs, but in biotechnology and financial services and money laundering and fraud and things that need a lot of compute power. And so the US right now is looking at the opportunity to sort of control the fate of the development of leading edge technologies, chipsets. And of course, this puts strain on both sides. It puts strains on US manufacturers and designers of semiconductors. It also puts strain on equipment makers, because part of this ban is also the shipping of equipment, the export of equipment that China needs in order to build more leading edge capacity. So as I see it, it's a very interesting moment because it's not only macroeconomic, it's also about their economic policy and national defense and security. But if we're talking strictly, Daniel, what it means for businesses, I mean, if China consumes more than 75% of this, and that market is effectively blocked off, you know, it's the Biden administration really does put these controls in place and cracks down. What does that mean for these companies in terms of revenue? Well, right now it's only very specific chips and everybody's been assessing this. It's not the whole portfolio of semiconductors. Folks, I've listened to, you know, Justin Wong and Nvidia, they're already accounting for what they think are going to be components of their portfolio and the impact that it might have on revenue. And of course, we've seen the early warnings coming out from these companies. There's certainly a chance that this could have a much bigger waterfall effect. But I think these companies have already looked at the situation they're assessing it. And in this sort of tough macro and tough economic period, they're starting to put those warnings out about what it could mean. I'm not overly alarmed that it's going to be the whole portfolio of all chips, lagging edge that are used to manufacture our frigerators and air conditioning systems. I think this is about leading the arms race for the next generation of technology in areas like supercomputing, high performance compute and artificial intelligence.

The social media giant saying on Twitter that its app has never been used to target American government, activists, public figures, or journalists. This is a response to a report in Forbes that data would have been accessed without users knowledge or consent. Forbes reporting that Tiktok's parent company started a monitoring project to investigate misconduct by employees. It's unclear whether American citizens' data was ever collected, but the report says there had been a plan to obtain location data from U.S. users' devices. Well, Tiktok is also out with some other news this week on its plan to grow with its consumers and thus making the move to introduce an adult's only option for live streamers on the platform. Let me want to restrict their viewership to those 18 and older. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Kelsey Barbario who is following this for us. Let's define adults only. People heard this and thought, whoa, where is Tiktok going? I know they're like, is this going to be the new only fans? I don't think that that is the intention whatsoever. Tiktok is actually quite buttoned up with what they allow on their platform. What I think that the big takeaway here is that they are moving their live streams from right now, 16-year-olds and older. With a minimum of 1,000 followers, they're the ones that are eligible to live stream. They're just bumping that up to 18. That's going to be on November 23rd. But outside of that, people are going to be allowed to kind of clarify what audience might be the best suited for their live stream. So say you've got like a comedy show that you're going to do on a live show or live stream, excuse me. And it's a little inappropriate for younger people, you could mark that in flag it as being for adults. So that way the people under 18 are not seeing it. So part of this is about the maturation of their users that they are going to be 18 and older when you think about sort of the demographic. Tiktok also implementing further restrictions to the type of content they're going to be allowing there. What more do we know about that? Yeah, so outside of the live streams, I think that they're looking into more safety practices overall. So for example, they have three different things that they're specifically honing in on. That's going to be hateful ideology is eating disorders, endangering acts and challenges. And I think that last one is most specifically targeted for children. Because think about things like the tide pod challenge from a million years ago or most specifically recently the cooking chicken and naikwool. That's the sort of stuff that they do not want to be affiliated with Tiktok. And so they're really working on making sure that those practices absolutely are not allowed on the platform. How much of this is about what they've seen with the other platforms and getting out on the head with competitors like Instagram. I feel like there is a whole lot to do with that. I mean, you know, Congress has really been cracking down on social media platforms recently. And I think that they're just trying to get ahead of things before something might come on for them as well. Okay. Kelsey is always not just on Tiktok, but our Tiktok expert. Thanks so much for that. And let's do a final market check before we let you go. And we are so agree across the board here. The game's sort of accelerating as we count down to the weekend, the Dow is up nearly 400 points, the S&P 500, up about 40 points and the NASDAQ up 82 points there. Certainly earnings and focused yet again today. The one big mover we've been tracking very closely is SNAP along with some of these other social media stocks as concerns about declining ad revenue there, take hold as well. And yield also in focus we should point out as we look ahead to that next FOMC meeting. And those reports out today that potentially fed officials are considering slowing down some of those rate hikes because of the concerns of how they've taken hold in the economy. And that does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here in the Yakku finance live. We're out there right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,29,2022-10-21 15:58:41

3847," would actually perhaps dampen demand because of the interest rates also impacting the way that consumers or customers might be able to finance these vehicles in the futures too. That's another major consideration for a company in Tesla. And that particularly directly correlates with some of the demand or some of the forecasts that they're even talking about here. 50% a year in terms of production sales deliveries that they're trying to grow towards in the near future. Yeah, I mean, he sort of acknowledged maybe a softening in demand, right? But overall, the narrative continues to be at Tesla. Demands fine. Demands okay. We are not able to get as many cars as we produce into people's hands. And that really accounts for the gap here that we're seeing that the company is not going to necessarily meet its production and delivery targets for 2022. So, the other deliveries should be 50%. That's the long-term annual target. They're not going to make that this year. And that was the big news that came out last night. But even in the meantime, because of supply chain issues affecting that, supply chain and delivery issues are also affecting the cars they can make, getting to people, shipping costs are going up, having trouble getting space. And then, when ships, for example, that they need, that's what they're talking about. All of this affecting the automotive gross margin, the quarter 27.9%, which is short of estimate. So, that's why we're seeing the shares down this morning. Maybe a little bit of feed-through in concerns about demand. But the company's line continues to be blaming it on supply chain, blaming it on shipping, et cetera. So, like before we bring our guests here on this one, a lot of chatter out there on the street this morning about a potential China slowdown over on Tesla. I'm looking at a good note by the Guggenheim team, noting potential price cuts on Tesla vehicles. One of you heard that before coming out of China potentially, this fourth quarter, they're calling out rising competition. Look, we've talked to X-Pung, Leonardo, a lot of folks. There's a lot more EVs, players in that key market. And Tesla might be losing market share in its second most important market. Yeah, China, of course, and the Shanghai Gigafactory and ramping up production deliveries. They talked about that on the call, experiencing a reverse recession of sorts, which was interesting to hear. Property market related, property market mostly is what Elon said there. And then Europe, especially with Gigafactory Berlin, they address that on the call too. We've got much more on Tesla here. Let's bring in Wells Fargo equity analyst Colin Langen and New Street Research Managing Partner Pierre Fargo. Great to have you here with us this morning. Colin, first, I want to go to you because you had actually been able to get a question in on the call yesterday. And particularly as we think through full self driving some of what Tesla is selling potential buyers on in the future, do you believe that the demand is going to be able to sustain itself to some of the targets that Tesla is putting forward? In terms of full self driving, I think their timeline is a bit optimistic. I mean, I think particularly when you define full self driving and I think on the call of the question, my question. He described really isn't what most experts would call level four level five full self driving. It's so it still has to monitor the vehicle. That would be an advanced like level two plus type system, which could be very impressive, but not the definition where you could actually remove the person from the car. And San Francisco and the cruise vehicle that's full self driving. There's no one in the driver's seat in the car was driving itself. I think that's kind of what he has promised in the past. And so it seems like it'll be falling short of that. And from the experts that I talked to quite frankly, I don't know without a LiDAR without all the sensors. It's possible. It's going to take I think a very, very long time to get to true level four. So I'm bit skeptical about what full self driving really piece. I'm sure you just heard us talking or highlighting some concerns out of China. What are you seeing in that China market for Tesla? Are they losing market share and how much might they cut prices this quarter? So yeah, it's a good question. What's happening in China today is the way I would characterize it is that we are entering into a phase of like slowing, sustaining and demand. And of course, everybody in China is adapting to that to that circumstances, but you have to keep in mind the context, which is that broadly overall for electric cars in China and everywhere in the world. And supply is still below demand. Jim and still exceeding supply. When you see market share movements, most of the time it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,31,2022-10-21 16:07:09
3848," China and everywhere in the world supply is still below demand, demand is still exceeding supply. When you see market share movements, most of the time it's just going to be about who is capable of bringing in cars to the markets. So what is going to drive market share going forward and what has been driving market share so far is much more and I'm talking about cars that can be compared like not like a 15,000 of cars with a 50,000 car of course. What is going to drive market share is actually supply. How many cars can you produce is going to drive your market share? That's what has been driving market share so far. When you look at price cuts, don't necessarily look at it as a reaction to the local market. Think about it more as for Tesla a way to manage the delivery of their cars. At a moment they are shipping a lot of cars outside of China towards other markets. You'll see prices in China holding very high and if at some point Tesla is producing a lot of cars and needs to get these cars into the hand of drivers fast in the Chinese market, they're going to lower their prices. So these movements are actually very tactical. They're always interpreted as more like strategic and long term reaction to a softening of demand. I think it's a mistake. My experience of that surprising price in strategy is actually to be very tactical and play on where they want the gas to be delivered. So let's play off of that a little bit Colin. So do you think there are any longer term implications of what we heard from Tesla in terms of the overall demand picture? I do think as we go into next year's demand is just going to be mathematically tough to do. So if you go back historically and you look at the best selling ever sedan, best selling ever SUV, it's the RAV4 and the Corolla back in 2019 both happened to be the same year. They sold 2.3 million units. The 50% Kager would put you at 2 million units which would be needed almost all would be Model 3 and Model Y. It would probably be almost twice, you know, not quite twice the price point of those vehicles. So that's a very very high threshold at the price point we're talking about. So I do think something has to happen into next year. I think, you know, Q4 is probably okay. I mean they already have orders. They're going to deliver those orders. They've taken good pricing on those orders. I think as you get into next year and you have this very high target and a very high price point, I think something's going to have to give. I don't know that that's even special to Tesla to be honest with you. I think the whole industry is going to have pricing issues but I do think those are some concerns as I go into next year. Pierre, on the call, they were talking about an Elon specifically. What was talking about China, was talking about Europe and the US and all of those with regard to where they may sit within a recession going into one or staring down one in the future or actually actively in one. And so from your perspective, how much might that actually impact some of the demand that Tesla is hoping to lock in? Yeah, it's a great good question, Brad. Look at it from two separate angles. One is a secular angle. One is a specific angle. On a secular angle, as I said, everything indicates there is more demand for electric cars than they supply. It's probably going to remain so the same way. I know it's kind of disturbing for if you look at the industry, the kind industry in your career mirror, you've never seen cars that have had the success of the Tesla car, but look at these cars, they sell for 30 percent growth margins. They've gone through an exceptional unprecedented ramp in terms of manufacturing and they've been accepted in the markets that way. So they are probably going to blow away the kind of demand being by model in the history of the industry. That being said, next year, you have interest rates going up, you have an economic slowdown. Biden's a big deal, and it's very easy for consumers to enter into a mood of postponing the acquisition of a car because interest rates are too high because the economic environment is not good, not good, because the job is at risk. So if there is an economic slowdown, Tesla is going to be heard exactly the same way as other car manufacturers. And as Pauline mentioned, the first impact really is pricing, because when you're manufacturing, you need to get rid of that. They get out of your factory, you need to say that. So the first thing, car manufacturers we do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,32,2022-10-21 16:11:27
3849, mention the first impact really is pricing because when you're manufacturing guy you need to get rid of that they get out of your factory you need to say that so the first thing how many factors we do in an economic slowdown is lowering prices everybody will do that it's going to be very painful for everybody of course they slept with 30 person gross margins has a lot of room for man over to lower their pricey that's the reason why the team's like an Elon yesterday I said we can go very very very deep before we bear money before we start thinking so in our expansion plan so they are not worried about a recession not because they are not worried about demand they see that demand is at risk next year but if demand is at risk next year they're going to get prices they're going to keep growing the business and they're going to do fine the panel might look very very bad very very challenged no doubt that is but the trajectory of the side I think is not at risk you can we have to ask you this because we get questions like this on Twitter you know musk floating out there potential four trillion dollar valuation some would say he's joking around but still it's a number that he put out there yesterday is there anything in your modeling when you think about the next 10 to 15 years for this company that that might be the valuation they can get to I mean that seems quite a bit of a stretch I think it's comments you've been said there's a narrow path to that you'd have to give them full credit for all of these you know factors that I consider more like long-term optionality issues things like whether you could get true level for full self-driving whether there's actually some value in the Optimus spot and and Dojo and these sort of future projects I think from a pure auto-paker side that's going to be extremely difficult to do and Collin just quickly here must talking about the company board things generally good idea to buy back stock there's also the specter of him potentially personally selling more stock to continue to fund his Twitter purchase do you think one or both of those things does end up happening I think it's almost very likely that both will happen I mean you didn't say that the board was in support of the five to ten billion so I feel like that's almost a soft announcement of the buyback that would still only be one percent of the market cap so it's still fairly small despite the size yeah and I think from the stock sale I mean in the math is you know I think the original deal was that he had 21 billion of financial commitments with equity partners I think the the margin loan for my understanding of 13 to 12.5 is gone so there could be up to 33.5 of total equity commitments needed between him and whatever equity partners he has 15 billion of stock has been sold so there's still multiples of billions of potential of stock that might you might need to sell in order to close the Twitter deal all right we'll be on the lookout for both of those announcements potentially thanks guys appreciate it Collin Langan of Wells Bargo and Pierre-Fierreux Guru of New Street Research thanks to you both appreciate it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,33,2022-10-21 16:15:57
3850," you Think by 2025. What is that market opportunity? Well, good morning, Brian. Thank you for having me today. It's a big market opportunity because not only the market is expanding, but we are entering new segments of the market with new offers as a part of our age-to-class strategy. And those new offers are in the private 5G, in the IoT, and in the data switching portfolio in the connectivity space as well as security in the sassy space together with our flagship product, the SD1, and as well, increasing number of offers as a part of our HP Green Lake platform and new data services. So a combination of cable growth of the time and new segments that give us the opportunity to play over the next three years in that 250-plus billion dollar market. And Tony, that shift to software as a service which ultimately drives to annual recurring revenue, where are you at in that journey? Well, we have made a tremendous progress, if you recall, in 2019, I committed to make available all our offers from age-to-cloud as a service. And at the HP Discovery in June, we achieve a major milestone because not only are age solutions are now part of our HP Green Lake platform, but as well as workload optimization, infrastructure as a services, as a service, and as well as data services. So we made tremendous progress, but now we are operating as a company in a cloud-operating environment, where all our new offers are designed and delivered to HP Green Lake. So now is the journey on continuous adding and renewing those offers as we go forward. And that AIR, as we guided for the next three years, is going to grow between 35 and 45 percent, also not only on the back of a significant growth, which this year alone, we are growing a bookings in excess of 86 percent year to date. But the fact that we already have $7.7 billion of total control value in the Azure Service business in our balance sheet. Are you seeing any red flags or areas of concern in your business? Are customers cancelling orders, are they delaying decisions at all? Well, what is fascinating to me, Brian, is that we continue to see enduring demand for our products and our services. And Green Lake is at the top of that demand. Well, customers love about HP Green Lake. It's the fact that they get a unified cloud experience, inclusive of the public cloud, and all the services and applications they have on premises. And now they get the opportunity to extend not only into the public cloud, with the same experience, but also at the edge. And that's the next big opportunity for us, because we live in a much more distributed enterprise than ever before. And also new use cases are being developed and deployed at the edge. So that's for us is a point of differentiation in my mind. And then when it comes down to momentum, again, enduring demand, but we have not seen any major of the cancellations at all. And that to us is a very positive sign that digital transformation and a key top priority for our customers, and IT plays now a bigger role than ever before. Antonio, some of the analysts commentary I saw this morning. A lot of them see it be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook okay?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,34,2022-10-21 16:20:11
3851," So this morning, a lot of them see it be flagging the outlook for next year. A little cautious, a little below some of the estimates that were out there. Does that outlook account for a potential recession in the US? Well, that outlook as Tarek and I stated yesterday includes what we see as a potential disruption that made the market creates because of the inflation and the foreign current exchange, you know, kind of trends we see. So we have comprehended all of that in our outlook. But we are very confident about our outlook because obviously we have a record breaking backlog with again, enduring the amount continued to be in the market. Second is that also we continue to make a significant shift in not only in our product and portfolio mix, but in a way with the liver that makes. And third also, this company generates a lot of cash. And so from my vantage point, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed that outlook. Understanding that the biggest issue unknown today is actually in my mind not so much the macro environment, but more the volatility of the foreign exchange. Antonio, I'm on the the Hula Packard Enterprise stats page on Yahoo Finance and I see your stock trading at under six times four earnings. That is more than half of the broader market. Just given the performance of the business, I mean, that is shocking how you guys performed compared to the past year. You mentioned you have a lot of cash. How are you going to deploy cash over the next 12 months to get that multiple up? Yeah, I think you just said that really well. I mean, our disappointment is on the multiple because not only we're growing revenues, we are also growing recurrent revenues, which they represent more than one third over total revenues. And by the way, almost 80% of our profits are recurring. Okay. I think the market still want to see ongoing what I call performance on a free cash flow, which obviously has been a little bit losing through the separation and spin-offs and the restriction we had to do to rise size the company, which we are now. And our guidance on free cash flow now is at the midpoint two billion dollars. What you're going to see is the convergence of our non-GAP EPS to free cash flow. And that free cash flow is deploying in a balance way. Obviously, we are super committed to dividends, which today at the current stock price are represented almost at 4% yield, probably one of the highest in my mind in the tech sector. So we're going to continue to aggressively buy shares back obviously because the share price is depressed. But at the same time, we have to continue to invest in the business. Because ultimately, we've got to bring breakthrough innovation for our customers. But that investment in the business has a significant discipline around it, or return to invest the capital. And obviously, gear to higher margins and higher areas of growth, but all delivered through HP Green Lake, which drives that record and revenue. And obviously, over time, that will help our multiples as well. All right, we'll get some rest. I know it's been a long week for you. Antonio and Ari, he'll pack an enterprise CEO. Always good to get some time with you. I'll talk to you soon. Catch you on Twitter. Thank you, Brian.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,35,2022-10-21 16:24:42
3852," you Yeah. They're moving higher this morning after the tight reduction into the same, okay? Audio reopening. of AT&T are moving higher this morning after the telecom company reported third quarter earnings showing 708,000 post paid phone net ads and a 6% rise in mobility revenue year over year. AT&T CFO Pescao, Deroch joins us now discuss Pescao. Good to see you again. Three months ago we were here having a conversation at a time your stock was down double digits and you weren't worn on free cash flow. Now today the stock is up and there seems to be a different tone on this earnings release. Why is that the case? Look, first good morning Brian. Good morning everybody. You know, maybe let me just start. I think this journey dates back to a couple of years ago. What we've said is we we were going to invest to reaneritize growth in this business with a priority towards reaneritizing wireless and fiber growth. And for a long time we said that that investment initially would reduce earnings but over time would produce significant returns. And as late last year we said at the second half of this year earnings would start to see the benefits of all the work that's been done. So things are playing out exactly as we said. And look, overall I'd be remiss if I didn't thank my colleagues across the company for all their hard work and getting us to this point. In terms of what's different now I think last quarter there was a there was a bit of an overreaction by I think the marketplace and some of the media. In the end what we flagged and we tried to we tried to every quarter to be really transparent what we were seeing in the marketplace. What did we see? We saw that there was a normalization of collection patterns back to pre pandemic norms. That hasn't gotten any worse. It's pretty much the same. And you know in terms of overall delinquencies I've been saying this since the spring we are probably slightly worse than pre pandemic norms. But all of all really strong fundamentals. The thing to keep in mind is our business has a history of performing well even in challenging economic times. And we don't expect this time to be any different. You know that's an amazing acknowledgement here especially as we think about the fact that within the market consumers are paying more in some of their other necessities that they have to account for as well. And so when it comes down to their telecommunications service provider like an AT&T and the delinquencies that you are seeing where are you also seeing perhaps the either type of device that customers that are net ads may be opting in for is it on the higher tier is it on a mid tier and what type of service for those devices as well. Yeah and I would say it's a bit across the board. First and foremost consumers as a general matter more and more people are signing up to higher price plans because of the value that those plans provide in terms of additional bandwidth. But not everyone is taking the device promotions. In fact a meaningful portion of our subscriber additions in wireless come through our business relationships and that channel it has been and continues to be really efficient source of generating new subscribers and so we're benefiting from that and we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter resonating with customers and our sales team know how to execute it and all those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,36,2022-10-21 16:29:02
3853," And we're seeing just the consistency of our offer quarter after quarter, resonating with customers. And our sales team know how to execute it. And all those things are contributing to continued improvement in subscribers, as well as higher R-POOs. You layer on top of that a better international, more international travel also contributing to higher roaming revenues. All those things are driving improvements in R-POO. And we've been doing a lot of work in our cost structure, and you're starting to see some of that benefit come through to the bottom line. So we feel really good about how we're performing. Pascal, it's Julie here. So obviously a lot of attention being paid to your networking investments as you pointed out. And there have been some reports that you are in discussions to spend a lot more on the network. There was a report recently that you're working with one of the big banks to increase your fiber optic cable investment, a $10 to $15 billion investment potentially. Is there anything you can tell us about that and what it would mean for your customers and for your network? As a matter of policy, we don't talk about rumors in the press, but let me tell you overall how we think about fiber. Fiber right now is the best technology, and as we look out the next decade or two, there is nothing under horizon that will match the effectiveness of fiber, especially in terms of the speed, the bandwidth, and importantly symmetrical speed. And we don't see anything changing that. We are the largest provider in the US. We know how to do it very well. We can do it more efficiently than others. And we are prioritizing investment fiber. If there are opportunities for us to accelerate that through different partnerships, well, of course we'll look at that. As John Stake said on the call this morning, his job is to make sure we are looking at all opportunities to potentially accelerate returns to our owners. Pascal, as pertains to your planning for 2023, two part question. One, are you planning for a recession? And the number two, are you planning for a pickup in promotions to consumers? Given the slowdown we might see. Here is what I would tell you. You will hear more about how we're thinking about 2023 when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Overall, what I did say on this morning's call is that, we understand, we're more than three quarters of the way through the year, and we understand what sort of macro-environment we're operating in now. And even considering all the challenges that we read about, we expect to grow earnings of free cash flow next year. What we'll do, but we want to make sure we wait till the fourth quarter and have the best possible information. And at that point, we will tell you how we are thinking about more precisely, how we expect the magnitude of earnings of free cash flow growth. Within that, though, and as you start to think about what a potential recession might look like, for the business, what does that real margin run rate actually sustain at over that period of time, given the delinquencies that you were talking about a moment ago? When you look back at history, even in downturns, the telecommunications sector tends to be more resilient than most. Clearly, we would be impacted like others, but not nearly to the same extent. And right now, when you look at the criticality of telecommunications, whether wireless or broadband connectivity, that's one of the last things the consumer will turn off, even in a challenging economic environment. With that said, look, they pay me to make sure that we have the opportunity in the event that we encounter difficult and operating environments to identify potential offsets and things we would look to or things like, do we moderate the pace of our investments then in capital, but all in all, the good news about where we are today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,37,2022-10-21 16:33:08
3854," Our today is that we believe we can continue to invest meaningfully in our business, comfortably pay our dividend and still continue to deliver over the next several years. But look, if they are really challenging economics environment that we're operating in, we will look for all the ways to offset that. They may not turn it off, but would they trade down in terms of the service that they are receiving from AT&T? And have you seen that show up in anywhere in the business? It hasn't shown up. In fact, more consumers are opting for the higher price plan. That's part of what's driving the growth in our article that we reported. All right, we'll leave it there. AT&T, CFO, Pascal DeRroge. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Good seeing you. Thank you, everyone. Bye. Hi, everyone. We're going to make a great start to the $2,030 Let's just bring in another guest into the hour here. We've got George, a Kennacore genuity, managing director. George, let's just build on those comments from Praz. What's your sense right now on why the stock is pulled back so significantly? Is this about the street just simply saying, we don't necessarily buy this story that demand's going to stay strong in Q4. Well, first thanks for having me. I can't remember and I've been looking at the stock for a long time. Elon Musk acknowledged that there was a demand issue, particularly in China. And if you guys remember several years ago and someone asked about demand, he called it a boring question, right? So this might be the first time we actually acknowledge a little bit of a of a down tick. But at the same time, he said the company would grow significantly in Q4 and we think they could do about 450,000 deliveries. And then they're going to sell as many cars as they can build for the foreseeable future, which is about 50% year of year growth as far as the I can see. And so what we did is, you know, we thought about how we can square that circle. And for us, it came up to a couple of things. First, the company has had backlog for a really long period of time and they're probably going to drain a little bit of that Q4. There are some fleet sales to companies like hurts that they could maybe sell in Q4 that help. And then when you look into 2023 specifically, the cyber truck comes online and that really helps, they start producing more in Austin, they have Tesla, send me sales and then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,38,2022-10-21 16:37:42
3855," truck comes online and that really helps. They start producing more in Austin. They have Tesla semi sales and then beyond that, hopefully we're out of this economic bump that they were in currently and EVs, if you remember, are really, really, really small percentage of overall sales. And so that will start to help. So we think there's some, there's method to the madness and there's logic as to why he guided them to grow significantly this year and continue their growth into next year. But I completely agree and understand there's too many bread crumbs that indicate that there's been a slowdown in the man and even acknowledge it when the yesterday's fall. Hey, Georgia, pros again. So I just wanted to talk to you about a couple of things that I sort of struck me last time the call. You mentioned the cyber truck, how they're going in the tooling phase and put for potential sort of, I guess, production start in mid 2023. But also you mentioned the cheaper Tesla, the kind of entry-level car that would potentially be half the cost or something like that versus the mile three. What did you think about that? Because they actually kind of sort of confirm that this is actually in the works. Yeah, so on the cyber truck, it's one of the things that may give the company a lot of confidence in growth in 23 and beyond. Because look, I'm pretty confident that the company won't keep the pricing that had discussed last time when they first introduced it. But remember, they had millions according to the press, millions of orders for the cyber truck, starting in 2023. And so even if they had a lot of cancellations, that's a lot of demand. I personally would get one if my wife let me, but she told me she would be content driving it. So it's clearly an acquired taste and a lot of people really like it. On the Robotaxi platform, it's a really interesting question. So basically, you think about the company's ability to bring down the cost of production for a vehicle. They've done a really, really marvelous job with the Model 3 slash Model Y platform, which costs about somewhere in the mid $30,000 range to make. And when it comes to Robotaxi, that's another step down in production. Cost out branded. It won't be as a big of a vehicle. It'll be a lot of nuances to it. Probably won't have a steering wheel and some odd stuff like that that will enable autonomous driving. But it's another platform through which the company can reduce costs and help e.d.s proliferate the gold. George, in terms of potential for buybacks, it sort of felt like Elon Musk dangled that carrot for investors who have been a little jittery around the stock. He said $5 to $10 billion is certainly possible. These were his words for next year. I wonder what you make of that. How much of this is about trying to get those investors to stick it out, those who have been concerned about his distractions with Twitter? And is this really the best use of capital for a company? Should that be used towards more CapEx? Just to be blunt, we don't like it. You know, buybacks are things that companies like Newspaper Company do not Tesla that has significant opportunity in front of it. We think there's better use of capital to accelerate CapEx plans, to build cars, to build the robot army that Elon Musk wants to build. It's just, in our opinion, there are just better ways to accelerate their plans around having EVs proliferate the globe. And other opportunities, including battery factories and robots. So look, I'm sure that they've done a lot of math behind it. And they want to see the support to stock down here in the 200s. But we think ultimately long term the best way to support the stock is to grow for as long as you can. George, we didn't even get to ask you about the valuation. And Elon Musk calling for a valuation for a Tesla could equal Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. But that's for another conversation around a time here. George, you know, because Ken Accord, Genuity, Managing Director are thanks to you and our thanks to Yahoo Finance's Pros Supermanion.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,39,2022-10-21 16:41:53

3857," And so that was a lot of the conversation this morning. Yeah, talk to me a bit more about that where you're seeing the pullback and volume and where are the biggest biggest headwinds for you right now. Yeah, it's mostly related to the consumer. So consumer oriented shipments on our railroad that tends to be domestic intermodal parcel. You know, a few things driven by the consumer. Those are those are looking like they're cooling off. The consumer has already been shifting from goods back to services, not all the way back. You recall there was a real fundamental shift towards goods during the pandemic. So it hasn't gone all the way back, but at the same time, it does appear that they're buying less and you can see that in international intermodal boxes hitting the west coast ports. And you can also see it in demand for truck and demand for domestic intermodal on our railroad. There are some markets though that where we're seeing strong demand and it's not going away. Things like coal, some of the other things like that. The amount of gas that we're looking at right now is like, we're looking at the spot, we're looking at the properties. We're looking at the amount of the robot utilities, grain, rock and then a handful of our industrial segments as well. But the total picture says we're going to grow year-over-year in the fourth quarter. It's just not going to be as much as we thought it would. Lans, last time we spoke, we were talking about the labor agreements ongoing. And I saw the number here in your quarter, $140 million Now, you know, I'm less comfortable than I was before the B&W E are maintenance of way employees failed ratification, but I'm not concerned. We've got six unions having ratified. We've got five in the ratification vote, and we've got more work to do now with the BMW EED. I think that vote failed to ratify for a very specific reason, the PEP, in addition to proposing wage levels, which are very attractive to our employees. They also said for about half, about 40% of that craft that does maintenance of way, we needed to adjust the travel that we would pay them to go from home to their away from home work location, and the per dime we'd pay while they were working away from home. That negotiation happened on property, and it just closed up on UP about a week ago, a couple of weeks ago. And that was at the very tail end of the ratification vote for that contract. So I think those were connected. We're back out now working with the BMW EED to try to figure out a temporary agreement that can be or a tentative agreement that can be taken back out for ratification. I anticipate we're going to be able to do that. We've got status quo in place there. Other than that, we need to get through the ratification on these other five unions, and get this baby closed out by the end of the year. And I think that's still the probable outcome. So end of the year, still the timeline that you're looking at, despite some of the snacks that you've hit. Yeah, I am. I guess the maintenance away employees could drag over into next year. I don't anticipate that. I think there's a path forward for us to get another tentative agreement, get it back out for vote. Lance, it's always great to have you on the show, Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz. Appreciate your time today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,41,2022-10-21 16:50:47
3858," you you you you talking it wage growth moving lower to help quell the inflation. On the inflation expectations objective, they've succeeded. If you look at one year, five year forwards, that's inflation a year from now and the subsequent five year period this comes out of the bond market. These are investors putting the money where their mouth is. It's very consistent with the Fed's target of two to two and a half percent on the consumer price index. And with regard to growth on jobs, same progress. If you go back say six months ago, average monthly job growth was about 500,000. Now it feels like it's about 300,000. Still a lot more work to be done here. We need to get down below 100K to get unemployment from stop to stop falling and start moving a little bit north and slowing the wage growth and quelling the inflation. So still more work to be done, but I think they've made progress. It's a pretty good progress since the beginning of the year. Will they need a recession to get things back to 2 percent? I don't think so. I mean, I don't say that with a lot of confidence. Recession risks obviously are very high and this is going to be very difficult. But my sense is that there is a path forward that will allow them to solve land in the economy. And I do think they've laid out a script for us. The federal funds rate target, which is three to three and a quarter percent. It's headed to more than half to four and three quarters by early next year. And I think that should be sufficient given the tightening and financial conditions that to kind of stock market the increase in the value of the dollar, the increase in mortgage rates, the tightening and bank underwriting standards, to slow the economy sufficiently to get inflation moving in the right direction. But it is a path, but it's a narrow path. And it is getting narrower as we get these inflation statistics that are definitely a disappointment. Mark, when do you expect us to start seeing in the data that CPI, that inflation has significantly cooled? Are we talking two months from now, four months from now? I guess what's your best prediction on that? Yeah, I think over the next six months, we should see inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,42,2022-10-21 16:54:51
3859," CPI that inflation has significantly cooled. Are we talking two months from now, four months from now? I guess what's your best prediction on that? Yeah, I think over the next six months we should see inflation CPI inflation. Let's say rounding is 8% ish. I think by next spring we should be 4% ish and that assumes the main assumption there is that oil prices stay 90 95 bucks a barrel right now there are 85 bucks that would be consistent with you know $4 for a gallon of regular and let it if we if we can manage that if oil prices can stay roughly in that range then The arithmetic here is in our favor because of the this is all year over year and we saw some big increases in oil energy prices a year ago So that should bring in inflation to 8 to 4 The hard part is going to be though getting from 4 to 2 2 and a half That's going to be more difficult that goes to Rent growth and the cost of housing we're getting some better news there But that'll take a while in the most difficult part of this will be getting the job market to slow Get wage growth moderating because that's key to service price inflation And that's the last mile and that's going to take a while probably not until early 2024 and because of that do you think at some point the Fed calls it a win with inflation around 4% Yeah, so what I think they'll do is they'll follow the script they'll go to 4 and a half 4 and 3 quarters by By end of January that's the the meeting in early early next year They stop they take a look around they know that the impact of the rate hikes will filter through The financial system in economy with a long lag so they want to take a look around I want to make sure job growth is slowing as I anticipate that wage growth is rolling as I anticipate that inflation has moderated as I Just articulated and moving in the right direction And if if it is then that's the end of the story The 4.5% of underrated is the so-called terminal rate the highest rate in cycle and well keep it there Until for a while into 2024 until it's obvious that we're headed back to target or close to But that would be a scenario where we kind of sort of squeak our way through avoid a recession Although I don't want to sound too polyannish under any scenario Uh the next year 18 months are going to feel pretty uncomfortable. It's just a matter of how much discomfort we're going to feel Mark I guess when we're also trying to figure out whether or not the risk here that the Fed is going to overshoot I know you're saying that you expect them to pause But what do you think the risk is though that they front load too much if we get a more aggressive Rate hikes in the next two meetings before the end of the year? Are you concerned at all just about the spillover effect looking ahead to 2023? Well the risk here are two-sided They certainly could overshoot. You know, they may not pause as I anticipate early next year they keep on going Uh, and something breaks, you know in the financial system I you know The higher rates go the faster they go the longer they stay up Something in the financial system is not going to work as anticipated. We got a taste of that over in the UK a couple three weeks ago Oh when the British pension funds choked on the former prime minister's plan saw interest rates rise and it exposed some problems and their derivatives Product that they've been using to match their assets and liabilities. That's very esoteric But that's the kind of thing that you know will happen in a you know highly stressed environment with interest rates At high levels for an extended period But you know there is also the other risk that they Uh, misjudge they they should continue to tighten because inflation isn't moderating sufficiently They keep rates too low at 4.5% for too long the inflation gets entrenched and that's a stack flation scenario Which is pretty ugly particularly because we will ultimately experience recession But just later and it'll be more deep and severe. So the risks on either side that which you know Obviously makes it's you know really tricky going forward. Hopefully they can kind of calibrate things and get it roughly right But a lot of obviously a lot of risk around that mark that something many fear might break is the housing sector where we are seeing some fed success If you want to see it that way how much pain is it head in housing? How do you quantify it? Yeah, well housing's the most race-sensitive sector of the economy So it's not surprising. It's taking it on the chin. I mean this is this is by design the Federal Reserve is raising race to slow the Economies growth rate the job market to Quell inflation and so housing is going to suffer and it really is you know, it's taking it's getting nailed You know you saw today's existing home sales numbers that gives you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,43,2022-10-21 16:59:12
3860," and so housing is gonna suffer and it really is. You know, it's getting nailed. You saw today's existing home sales numbers that gives you a sense of the hit to the man. The net goes to high rates, 30 year fixed mortgage rates over 700%. You multiply that by the house prices and it's just unaffordable for most people, potential for some of buyers just can't afford that. And then people will own their home with a mortgage. They're kind of locked in because if they have to sell their home and get a new mortgage to buy another home at a much higher rate, that's just not gonna work economically. So it does mean that house prices are gonna come in. They have to come in. They are coming in pretty fast. I've been surprised at how fast they started to fall, particularly in places like California where we're already seeing kind of five, six, seven percent declines from the peak. So we should buckle in. This is gonna happen to me. I do expect even with no recession, we'll probably get a double digit kind of decline in house prices nationwide peak to trough. I am hopeful though that that's not the place anything where anything breaks because in the sense of what's going on in the system because the underlying quality of the mortgages, the underwriting, the bars has been excellent since the financial crisis. And of course, even with these house price declines, that's after a period of very strong house price growth. So all you're doing is retracing part of the increase that we've experienced since the pandemic hit. So I'm hopeful we will see some increase in mortgage defaults and foreclosure and distress sales, but I am hopeful that that's modest. And so that's not, I don't think that's the place where the system will break. Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandee, good to see you, sir. Thank you. In this episode of influencers, data scientist and Facebook whistleblower, Francis Hogan. I think unless Facebook changes a lot of people are going to die. And the reality is a lot of people do get wiped out by the stock slide. Facebook has a series of whistleblowers. Like, I am not the only whistleblower. There's like a new one every two weeks. And when Facebook misleads people about the value of the company, and when you lie about material issues, you are lying about the value of the company. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers I'm Andy Sherwer. And welcome to our guest, Francis Hogan, former product manager at Facebook, Metta, who recently blew the whistle about companies practices by leaking thousands of internal documents. Francis, great to see you. Thank you for inviting me. So first of all, why did you do it? And what is your life like now? I came forward because I saw that the information that Facebook was withholding from the public was critical to the public safety, that people needed to know in order to make responsible choices. And that Facebook was consistently resolving tradeoffs in a way that was in their own interests and not in the interests of public safety. They were putting profits over people. More so than say any other company, like an oil company or a retailer. I think an oil company is a great company to contrast Facebook with, which is oil companies are radically more transparent, because we can literally go and put sensors around an oil fill. You can measure the pollution. They satellites to see, are they capping the methane leaks? There are all these things where we can be accountable, or that company knows it is accountable in some way. Facebook knows that no matter what activists bring forward, they can just deny that it exists. And one of the things that happened over and over again after I came out was activists would reach out to me and say, I brought this up five years ago. I've been giving the evidence of human trafficking on the platform for years, and they always tell me, this is just anecdotal. It's not a real trend. It's not actually a big problem. But the documents show they knew it was a big problem. Was that was the difference because people have been complaining and pointing fingers to this company for a long time, but it's the actual physical proof of those documents, right? Exactly. That's what changed. We now have evidence that these things that have been raised for years, like people who have been laying the groundwork, activists have been doing tons of work, and now we have the proof.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,44,2022-10-21 17:03:31
3861," Okay, that's right. Exactly. That's what changed. We now have evidence that these things that have been raised for years, like people have been laying the groundwork activists have been doing tons of work. And now we have the proof that Facebook knew and didn't resolve these problems. And what about this point of your life and how that's changed? I was in Portugal at the Web Summit. There were thousands of people who are hanging on your every word. I have to say like so my life in general has not changed that much. So one of the few blessings of COVID is like we didn't go out and socialize a lot before. And after I came out we didn't go on socialize again. Like I have I have I have silly acts so we most of our meals at home. And so the day-to-day life is not really changed. But things like Web Summit, I really don't like being the center of attention. Like it gives me a huge amount of anxiety. And I remember going in Web Summit and thinking to myself, I am so grateful that I am not someone who like gets buzzed off of being the center of attention. Because I could totally imagine that experience being addictive. And instead it was just terrifying. Because like there are like 12,000 people there. It's a lot of people. What about Washington DC, Francis? This is a big question. And you've got both sides of the aisle that are concerned about big tech and Facebook in particular. And yet they disagree about what the problem is, never mind what the solution is. One of the things I've been trying to do is kind of shift the conversation. Because Facebook knows that as long as we think the argument is about censorship, you know, is it too much censorship? Is it not enough censorship? As long as we focus on that as the conflict we will never resolve it. But what Facebook knows is that there's lots of solutions that don't involve content. Right? They involve the dynamics of the algorithm. They involve product choices. Like should you have a multi-picker that lets you spam out to 10 groups at the same time, the same piece of content. Facebook knows they have all these solutions that aren't about content. And as long as we're arguing about censorship, we're not going to hold them accountable on these other things. And so the main thing that I think there's a point of common ground is, you know, people on the left on the right believe that people have the right to make informed choices. Right? That you only really can consent or like voluntarily choose to do something if you have enough information to make that choice. And so I've been pushing for what I call like nutrition labels. So like, you know, the government doesn't tell us what to put in our mouths. But it does say, hey, if you claim this is in your food and used to be in your food. And you need to listen to much trans fats in it. And if you'll notice, the government never banned trans fats. But as soon as it couldn't consumers had that information, it disappeared from all of our products. We don't have a nutritional label for TikTok. We don't have a nutritional label for Facebook. But the public has a right to have real data, not Facebook or artistic data, but like real data on how these platforms work so they can make choices. We're calling it Facebook, but the companies renamed itself meta. So should we be calling it meta or Facebook Francis? I am trying to train myself to say meta because I know a big part about why they made this shift is they want to run away from the conflict. And the reality is that people are dying. Children are dying, right? They're going to be women walking around this country of brittle bones in 60 years because Facebook made choices to not stop its algorithms from driving women towards the inter-executive content. Right? This is a crisis and Facebook thinks they can change its name and just focus on video games and that it will all go away. And so I that's one of my goals in 2022. It's to be able to say meta and Facebook in the same sentence because we can't let them run away from the damage that they're doing. How would you say that in the same sense? Like you could say meta's Facebook or I could say meta Facebook, but we need to make sure that you know one of the reasons they did it was they know their employees feel ashamed to admit they work at Facebook and now they can say they work at meta. I have a backpack from when I worked there and in tech, tech companies love giving you swag. You know a t-shirt this is Google, a backpack that says snapchat. My Facebook backpack had the Facebook logo on the inside. I never received a single shirt hoodie whatever a Facebook that said Facebook. You mean they were concerned even at that point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,45,2022-10-21 17:07:52
3862," Inside. I never received a single shirt hoodie, whatever, a Facebook that said Facebook. You mean they were concerned even at that point about their branding and the backlash that it might produce if you were wearing a public? Yeah, exactly. And I think that's a giant red flag. Like, part of my mission and what motivates me every day is I know that people are suffering inside the company. Right? Like, not being willing to admit reality and the present is really hard. That cognitive dissonance is really hard. And I know that Mark Zuckerberg is suffering and that like every time you go in a restaurant and having people give you dirty looks, it has to be hard. And so we need to hold the company accountable and help it grow towards long-term success because the current impasse in hurts everyone. So what about Mark Zuckerberg, Francis? Is he a bad guy? Does he have evil intentions? How would you characterize him? So I never, in willing to call Mark, evil, it's funny. When I appeared in front of the UK parliament, there was a member of parliament that was very insistent. They're like, but is this evil? Is this evil? And I think it's really important to remember that Facebook is full of very well-intentioned people. And I think it is a problem about incentives. And some of those incentives, you know, Facebook has a fiduciary duty to act in the interests of shareholders. And I think it's a lot harder to prove long-term harms and short-term harms. And so Facebook has been stuck in the cycle where when they are faced with these conflicts where it's like, you know, you have to be 0.1% less profitable, where you have 10% less misinformation. Because there is no mandated transparency, it's very hard to make the business case that you don't choose that 0.1% of profit. So mandated transparency gives another center of mass that gives space for people inside the company to do the right quo. you you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,46,2022-10-21 17:12:01
3863," you You How close were you to Mark Zuckerberg? Did you have any direct contact with them? As they like to say, I was a low-level employee that I never sat in a seat meeting. I'm a data scientist. I worked on civic misinformation and later counter-espionage. You don't become an algorithmic expert if you like being the center of attention. It's an invisible thing behind the scenes. But the reality is, in Facebook's own documents, I saw the magnitude of the problem. And just surveying, operationally and organizationally, how Facebook worked. I have an MBA from Harvard. There's a lot of things where in Silicon Valley, we undervalue the role of leadership. And we undervalue the role of organizational health. And I think I had an opportunity to assess, like, what was the feasibility of change in a way that was different than a lot of people because I had had that opportunity for that education. And I don't think there's a path to change inside of Facebook without the help of the public. You wouldn't necessarily need to have access to those people to understand that there were problems there. In fact, my experience there is when you get close to that, there's an echo channel there. Oh, yeah. So I want to ask, I've spent a bunch of time in Menlo Park, obviously, not as much as you have on the campus. What was it like? Oh, the Facebook campus is so fascinating to me as an architectural object. So mostly, I'm unaware, but Facebook has the largest open floor plan office in the world. It is a quarter of a mile long. It's 5,000 people. It is such an amazing, you know, medieval societies built cathedrals because they were societies that were oriented around God. Right, like you have these gothic arches that lead your eye upwards like to the heavens, right? Facebook's campus is a physical manifestation of their obsession with flatness. Like the idea that we are all on the same level that, you know, their leadership style is we have metrics. And people can do whatever they want to move those metrics, like we embrace the freedom of individual employees. But when you don't acknowledge that power differentials exist, you actually reinforce those powered dynamics. And I think there are things around, you know, a situation where flatness is obsessed over means there's actually not a lot of space for single leaders to come forward to say there is a problem. Or we need to make a short term sacrifice for a long term gain. I think it was Orwell who said everyone's equal except some are more equal than others. And then that's not even acknowledged. Yeah. That's a fascinating, fascinating point. I want to ask you about this question about whether Facebook... Actually, can I give you a little bit more of a little bit of this one? Sure, please. To give you a sense of how absurd this space is. So Facebook is obsessed with 15 and 30 minute meetings. So like they're very efficient. They're obsessed with the word crisp, like are your documents crisp? Is your explanation crisp? The space is so large that I would regularly walk 15 minutes, 10, 15 minutes to go to a 30 minute meeting. And so even that level of absurdity that is more important for the building to be flat than to be functional for us to go to our meetings. It just kind of shows you the blindness of that religion. And you've worked at other big tech companies. You've mentioned Google, for instance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,47,2022-10-21 17:16:28
3864," or meetings. That it just kind of shows you the blindness of that religion. And you've worked at other big tech companies. You've mentioned Google, for instance. How is Facebook different from these other companies? And is it better or worse? Yeah. So I feel like there was more of an acknowledgement of users as equal stakeholders at other companies I worked at. So like Google, I don't know if people are aware of this. But Google is able to support thousands of languages, partially because they built tools that allowed individual communities to move Google into their language. But they said linguistic diversity matters at that level. And even back in the mid-2000s, I worked on internationalization on Google Books. And there was a real authentic commitment to how do we get into the most languages and adequately support them. Imagine if Facebook took the same attitude on safety. Right? If they came in and said, do we live in a linguistic diverse world? Let's make sure all of the dialects in Ethiopia are covered. There's 100 million people in Ethiopia. They're having a civil war right now that is being amplified by Facebook. They have 100 dialects, six major language families. Imagine if Facebook instead of being so closed. So Facebook has full control of their platform. The only one that you can see inside is full closed. Imagine if they said, we're going to take a page from the Google Playbook. And I, and make tools that allow Ethiopians to actually make all the safety systems working all their languages. They'd be a very different world. And so there's little details like that where I think there's an opportunity to open up Facebook and say, you are the internet in most countries. 80 or 90% of the content in most languages in the world is on Facebook. Imagine if they came and said, we actually acknowledge that power that we have. And we invite you to collaborate with us. We'd have a very different conversation right now. Do you think this company meta Facebook is in decline? I mean, part of the reason why the stock went down is because they had a decline in DEA use. First time. They've never had one. So what does that tell you about the future of this company? Yeah. So I've said repeatedly, I view the work that I'm doing as in the best interests of Facebook. Like, it might not feel that way today. But Facebook needs help to make long-term successful choices instead of optimizing so hard on the short term. And like having an environment where people like being on the platform, where they feel safe, where they feel like they're getting high quality information, that is a path to long-term success. Until Facebook takes responsibility and is just honest with people until they change their relationship with the public, I think they're going to keep seeing users live. Have you been in contact or have top executives at Facebook been in contact with you or have any executives been in contact with you? A director level, but not above that. There's a lot of really good people inside of Facebook. And one of the things that I hope comes out of the work I'm doing is that they have more space to be able to act. The company has already said that they are going to invest some more money. I don't think it's enough. Did you know that they're doing $75 billion of buybacks? Is that crazy? Crazy. And when they say they're going to invest $5 billion in safety in the next year, it's like, yeah, but you little on fire $75 billion. I mean, could you have done $10 billion in safety? But my actions do open up space inside the company for those good people to be able to make progress. And so that's always my hope. And what about the future of the internet? Francis, big question. I love that question. It looks right now. For instance, simplistically, the United States, China, Europe. Is that going to be the future going forward that there are at least three sort of geographies and distinct internet increasingly? So I think you're totally right that Europe is taking a different regulatory perspective. But in terms of networks, I believe if you look at it, I don't think Europe and the United States are going to isolate. So when you say China, China does have a closed internet. And the thing that I'm scared about is Russia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,48,2022-10-21 17:20:51
3865," I don't think Europe and the United States are going to isolate. So when you say China, China does have a closed internet. And the thing that I'm scared about is Russia and China have made indications that they may kind of merge their closed internet. Like they're talking about building their own closed financial system. They're talking about having their own closed internet. And I think once you start separating the internet and separating the financial systems, that's where things start to get dangerous. Because once you begin operating so independently, then you have opportunities for conflict. I think there's some really interesting conversations happening right now around the role of decentralization. So you might have heard of DeFi. You might have heard of Web3 or like crypto-based networks. And those are going to open some really interesting conversations. Because this is software that doesn't run in the United States or run in Europe or run in Africa. It runs everywhere simultaneously. It's applications. Then instead of running in a data center, they're all running in little kind of pockets everywhere on these decentralized networks. And so I think there's going to be unquestionably sometime in the next five years, probably, a social network where no one is responsible for it. Is that good or bad? It's a really interesting conversation, depends how it's designed. There's ways of designing these networks where you do safety not based on content, but you do it based on the dynamics of the network. And if they make those kinds of decisions, whether or like, oh, interesting, we're going to cut reshare chains at two. So that means allisrate something. Bob reshairs it. Carol reshairs it. And lands and dance moves. Imagine if Dan had a copy and paste that content in order to share it. So he had to hit a button. He has to copy and paste it. That change has the same impact as the whole third party fact checking program today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,49,2022-10-21 17:25:26
3866, you you so it sounds sort of like a social network kind of based on blockchain in a way it could be yeah I think there's going to be a one at some point I mean I know you're a big if correct me if I'm wrong crypto fan or I do believe in in the power of crypto right right yeah talk about I mean I don't want to go way down that rabbit hole we don't have too much time but tell us why you're a collaborative crypto and so I'm a big proponent of I'm not I always try not to give investment advice because people do ask this question I do think there are interesting opportunities though around you know we're getting new models of how to run finance systems like the defy networks you know the rules are transparent we all see exactly how they operate and I think they're interesting conversations are on governance that a lot of these crypto projects are experimenting with new ways of doing corporate governance right in terms of who gets to influence what decisions and how and as someone who really values organizational design and organizational health I'm intrigued to see where they go but beyond that I don't think I have an effects for teased to envision the future I want to ask you about your background you said you went to Harvard I knew you went to all and undergraduate grew up in Iowa City is there anything about your background upbringing you think that informed you in terms of decisions you made so I'm extremely grateful so I attended the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering it's in the Western suburbs in Massachusetts near Wellesley and it's a very small college you know it's 75 students a year but they believe that in order to be an impactful engineer and a responsible engineer you have to have more context and so all in intentionally incorporates more humanities into their curriculum than most engineering programs and they also incorporate design and entrepreneurship and it's based on the idea that engineers that can go found successful companies are ones both understand that dynamics of entrepreneurship but they also understand people because really good leaders are people who understand what drives human beings and so I think the fact that I had the opportunity to go to Olin gave me more context I think the fact that I did high school debate and I coached high school debate you know like I've I've had to sit there and and you know wrestle with 14 year olds on like how should society be structured so like think of think of your 14 year old being like that's not fair and imagine having to teach them how to unpack that and be like how do I have a conversation about why is it not fair tell me more I think those things made me care more about democracy and like what is the role of a technology just in a democracy and so I don't know I think all those things influence me and final question Francis what's next for you and what do you see as your legacy if it's not too really asked that I love five months into my whistle blow so I what's your legacy so I'm my big focus in 2022 is around helping to plant a decentralized youth led movement around social media a decentralized I'm sorry a decentralized youth led movement around transparency and accountability for technology and so we have started college tour the spring and the goals are on giving tools to young people,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,50,2022-10-21 17:29:23
3867," transparency and accountability for technology. And so we started a college tour this spring, and the goals are on giving tools to young people, like basically education on saying like, here are levers that we believe exists to either put pressure on Facebook, or ways that you can build networks of resiliency. Because young people are dying, right? And until we can get Facebook to do the responsible thing, young people can make a difference by caring for each other. And so that's my big focus that I'm working right now. And that is going to live under a nonprofit that we're in the process of founding. And the nonprofit is going to have two main focuses initially. One is plant that movement, which will eventually get spun off. And the second is something called open source integrity. So open source integrity is the idea that we the public need tools, assets, that allow us to hold Facebook accountable. So that means our own data, right? Our own ways of analyzing these things, simulated social networks. Because right now you can't get a master's degree in these safety systems, right? And we as a civilization need 10,000 more of these people minted every year. And so I want to figure out the tooling where we can have that feature. Francis Hagen, thank you so much for your time. Thank you so much for inviting me. This is great. You've been watching the influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. We'll see you next time. Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saazi here with Brad Smith, Julie Heimann as the day off. Markets are tiptoeing into the weekend as traders gear up for a big wave of earnings next week. Right now you're seeing all three major indices. I would say maybe a little bit more than tiptoeing. We're seeing the Dow up almost 335 points. Here's what else we're watching at this moment. No recession. American Express shares are under. We're under a little pressure after the company. It didn't raise its full year earnings guidance range. The stock is still under pressure. CEO Steven Squarry tells me concerns of a recession are overblown and dialing up in earnings. Be Verizon shares are in focus after the company. Be it on earnings, the posted week, subscriber gains, Brad Chaat, Verizon, CEO Hans Vesberg who noted that there are points of a couple points of weakness in that earnings report. More on that one on the Yowl Finance homepage right now. And it's time to travel. Spotlight the theme park sector following much better than expected earnings from airlines. Brad, over to you. All right, let's kick things off with a check of the major averages here. 32 minutes into trading on this Friday. And the Dow Jones industrial average right now. You're seeing that hold on to some slight gains right now. It's up by about 1.1%. All right, so a little bit more than slight gains here on the day. The NASDAQ composite as I bring this into an intraday view just to give us a better perspective of what's taking place. Look at that sharp move higher that we've seen within the first.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,51,2022-10-21 17:33:57
3868," like gains here on the day, the Nasdaq composite, as I bring this into an intra-day view just to give us a better perspective of what's taking place. Look at that sharp move higher that we've seen within the first 30 minutes of trade. We're up by about half a percent right now. As clearly investors, some of the sentiment right now is saying, hey, you know what, hold my beer. We could rally into this Friday, and that's what we're seeing right now is a little bit of an early session rally. The S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 1% here. And so you take a look at the broader week that we've been watching as well. This could potentially add on to some of the net gains that we had seen, even with the declines earlier in the day, we were still up on the week by about 2% as of right now with this move. We're up by about 3%, 3.3% on the S&P 500. Also, I want to take a look at some of the trending stocks on the Yahoo Finance homepage as well here. And yeah, it's none other than snapped. The brand of Ghost Face Chilla. Yeah, it's chilling on the day to the tune of about 30% of Chillin Lower in a bad way here. So we're continuing to watch that as well as Twitter. You're also seeing shares of Pinterest move in concert lower by about 6.3%. So for more on this move that we've been tracking with Snap as I put that back in focus on the day, down 30%. We've got Jeffrey's Senior Research Analyst, Brent Thill. Brent, just take us into your reaction after you saw the numbers cross from Snap and what the executives had to say on the call last night. Yeah, good morning. The quarter itself was OK. It was the guy. And they have obviously been experiencing decelerating growth just over a year ago. They said they could grow indefinitely for 50% and then the growth rate came into the 30s, into the teens, into the single digits. And they exited at high single digit growth and then said the quarter was growing at 9%. And then said the quarter would end flat because advertisers would fall off a cliff in the back half of the quarter. So I think it's more about the guide and more about the lack of visibility. There's clearly been a lot of departures there, senior leaders and sales have left to go to Netflix. You have a concern around advertisers moving to where the wallets are, meaning the younger audience and Snap don't have the dollars. The parents have the dollars. The older generation has the dollars. So you're seeing advertisers shift up from the lower end to the higher end, which makes sense. So we're still going to be influenced to buy household goods and items for to run our life. But that's not where we make the decisions on Snap, right? We may make a decision on Snap to buy the new Hawaiian shirt or buy concert ticket, but we're not going to be influenced to go. Again, make some of the bigger ticket purchases. So dollars for advertisers are shifting to Google, to Amazon, to prove and spend where the wallets are. And that's where the advertisers are at. We also have a competitive issue with TikTok, which is anyone that's fired up TikTok and spend five minutes with it, spends a half hour with it. It engages you. It brings you in. So advertisers naturally in the more experimental and younger audience are shifting away from Snap over to the TikTok platform. So there's a handful of forces. Change is in the team. Change is in advertisers. I think overall, the bigger picture, too, is the macro, which is we have a macro picture that's dimming. We are going into a recession in 23 per hour economists. This will start later than most economists have believed our team internally continues to believe that we are going to go into it more of a tailspin in next year that this takes time to come out into the economy. So if you think about that, if we do go into that tailspin, we advertisers naturally, the first thing they're going to say is we're not spending. Advertising can be tuned up and tuned down in a nanosecond. We described as the stereo knob in your car or at home. You can go up and down really quick. You can't do that in software. You can't do that in semis. You can't do that in other areas of technology. So right now, I think investors are just like, I don't want to be in advertising if we're going into a pro long in from 0.80% to 0. volunteerization. worse for working for our journey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,52,2022-10-21 17:38:22
3869," for you can't do that in semis, you can't do that in other areas of technology. So right now, I think investors are just like, I don't want to be in advertising if we're going into a prolonged downturn. I will be back to advertising names when we go back in the upturn. And there's, you know, safer names outside of tech. And that's what we continue to hear from our clients. It's just our clients want to be outside of technology. Right now, they want to be in energy. If you look at the the XLE, you know, up over 50% year to date, right? So the popular trade beginning of the year was short technology belong the XLE. And, you know, we've got the XLE up again today and up 54% year to date. So I don't think that the tone of technology overall and advertising and many of the other tech names that we cover is going to shift until we get into 2023 and we get a lot of these companies to really reset the numbers. So I expect a tougher, a tougher earnings season for the rest of tech. Brent, does the snap have to cut its expenses even further? Yes. I mean, they do. I mean, they just restructured the company. They obviously are in the process of still reducing the workforce by 20%. They may have to go deeper. And again, I think the thing we don't know is how long is this, this economic, you know, pullback going to last. It could last all next year. Again, our Jeffery's own economists have said this really starts later in the year versus early because it takes time for all these changes that the Fed is putting into place is going to be a way that comes in slowly. It doesn't come crashing in on you. And so the scary part of what's happening is we don't know exactly that this can be prolonged. A lot of companies are saying, oh, we're not seeing it. Some companies are saying we're seeing it. I think everyone's going to see it. And I think this is going to be, again, the concern, which is, you know, this could, this could get a lot darker than we all think. And that is a potential. Now, I would highlight that, look, if Elon Musk thinks that Twitter's worth $44 billion and Snap now has a, you know, roughly $12 billion market cap, you start to ask yourself, he's trying to build the X app, which is all these things you can do. Snap has a closer version of an X app than anyone. It has the map. It has the information page. It has a messaging service. It has ARVR. It has a gaming interface. I mean, there's, there's, there's many elements that investors have come back to me and said, well, Bren, if you want to create an X app, which is all these things that Twitter isn't today and fire 75% of the workforce, doesn't snap have all the, the foundational makings of what an X app would look like. And I'm like, yeah, absolutely. So at some point, you kind of go, look, we understand they've had execution issues. Again, the visibility on the advertising industry, that's across the board. I mean, it's not like meta and Google and Amazon's ad business or accelerating. They're all decelerating, right? So they're all facing the same headwinds now. Obviously, Snap's had stronger headwinds. But at some point, you go back to everyone is so negative that ultimately, if you have a long-term horizon and you sit and look at this and you believe, you know, these are typically some of the best opportunities for tech investors over a three-year period, not the next three months. So depending on your duration, I think there's some credible opportunities that are being born in this downturn that clearly, you know, we're going to have some hazy, overcast, foggy skies in the short term. But you're getting some interesting opportunities if you are a longer-term investor. Do you think there's some consolidation to be expected given the valuations right now? 100%. M&A is going to get a massively spike. M&A, there is no IPO window right now. So we have given birth to a lot of great technology companies. Many of these subsectors are overcrowded. You've already seen that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,53,2022-10-21 17:42:31
3870," Many of these sub-sectors are overcrowded. You've already seen that your to date, Tomo Verado, who's one of the best software investors in the planet, has spent over $20 billion acquiring multiple companies outside in the security and technology landscape. So if you look out even outside of social media, you've seen incredible consolidation. You've seen strategic deals like Adobe buying Figma for $20 billion. No one thought any company in the beginning of a recession would pay 50 times revenue, 5.0, and not 5.50. So we are going to see an incredible amount of strategic M&A, an incredible amount of private equity, let M&A. You're already seeing it. You're seeing the number of skyrocket, you're to date. You're seeing some of the best technology investors for the long haul. Like Tomo Verado, we'll say, this is go time for software consolidation. There's no question. And this is what we need to restore the health, because we're in that cycle of we expanded dramatically. We had so many IPOs. We've had no IPOs in tech this year. And so if you think about what's happening, you're going to go back to that natural consolidation phase of M&A. And we firmly believe we're seeing the signals already. We're seeing the best investors in the space talk about it. We're seeing the strategic step up and make acquisitions. You saw Adobe, you saw Microsoft in Activision. You've seen Salesforce go a little quiet. They have to go quiet in the short term, into it that did MailChimp for 12 billion. You've seen an incredible amount. And so I think ultimately these valuations are going to get cheaper. This is when you want to be acquiring if you're a strategic hero private equity. Great perspective, as always. Jeffrey, senior research analyst Brent, they'll have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. You do. Thanks. All right, before we head to break, let's take a look at some upbeat comments. On Uber and Lyft out of Deutsche Bank, before each company reports earnings, analyst Benjamin Black says, ride share demand backdrop for both Uber and Lyft remain strong, explains Black. Our data comports with recent Uber management commentary suggesting that ride share demand is beginning to follow typical seasonality. Therefore, we think the downside risk to ride share gross bookings for both companies is limited. Before we go to break, though, I will add this. Let's do a quick check of the markets here. You're seeing the stocks really come out of the gate. Strengthened, relative to the opening bell. And Brad, you flag this, and it seems to be moving off of this. The latest Nick Timmeros market moving, Wall Street Journal story. Really, I think for the first time, signaling that the Fed pivot or that time, or that point where the Fed pulls back a little bit on raising rates by 75 basis points, that might come in early 2023, perhaps quicker than some of the market expected. Yeah, within this reporting, a quote from Fed Governor Christopher Waller. From a speech earlier this month, however, that, of course, Fed whisperer that Nick Timmeros has become, that quote saying, we will have a very thoughtful discussion about the pace of tightening at our next meeting here. And that is really leaning further to some of this signaling, even in addendum to the Fed speak that we've gotten, the signaling now that there may be some type of pivot in the markets, certainly latching onto that here. Even that polar story can't turn around snap. We'll leave it there. I'll talk to you later.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,54,2022-10-21 17:47:03
3871," Merit The Walmart agreed to pay $215 million to the state of Florida over claims that its pharmacies helped fuel the opioid epidemic in that state. The retailer also agreed to give out $672,000 treatment kits to Florida first responders. According to Moody's, Florida has now secured $3.2 billion to help fight the opioid crisis. In a new report by Doach Bank, says Doach Bank is laying off dozens of employees, including some out of the UK, that's according to voters. No concrete number was given, but a person close to the matter says most of the cuts are in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit. This says a pullback in financing deals prompted lenders to cut back on costs. And Pfizer says it's hiking its US COVID vaccine price to over $100 per dose. Doach's could be costing between $110 to $130 per dose before insurance. Now this will take place after the US government's current purchase program expires. Right now the government pays around $30 per dose. And Adidas is cutting its full year guidance following weaker demand in Western markets and its exits from Russia. The company cut currency, neutral revenue expectations and lowered its expected operating margin to 4%. Adidas also blamed slowdowns in China and inventory buildups for the cuts. Despite the sour outlook, Adidas did see sales grow. 11% in Q3. Sawas? All right, from record home prices to record mortgage rates, 2022 has been a wild ride for the now ice cold housing market. But could this pain be good for prospective home buyers down the road? Y'all find it's a commoners for Newman is here with more so Rick, I should be cheering these declines because maybe at some point I'll be able to buy home. Maybe a year from now or something like that, but it's getting ugly in the housing market and it's probably going to get uglier. So we just saw the eighth consecutive month of declining existing home sales. That's the worst stretch since 2007 and what was happening in 2007. That was when the housing bubble was exploding. We got the home builders index this week. That has been going down. That's now at the lowest level since the bottom of the COVID downturn. And if you don't count that, it's the lowest level since 2012 again close to the bottom of the housing bust back then. So we have a long way to go to get through housing. Everybody has kind of seen this coming. I mean, this has almost everything to do with rising interest rates and mortgage rates now up around 7%. But we haven't seen prices really fall over yet. They've just started to turn and they will come down for sure. But we're at the beginning of a major correction and we probably have months to go. Rick, I like Sausie. Also just want to know when it's possible to buy a house. I guess further out down the line, what kind of changes are we really expecting for the consumer environment to look like, especially given the fact that if you have an absence of those buyers because of rates in the near term that sellers as well are going to be impacted as well and they're going to be less listings of existing homes. Yeah, this impacts everything on both the buyer and the seller side and the builders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,55,2022-10-21 17:51:21
3872," Sellers as well are going to be impacted as well and they're going to be less listings of existing homes. Yeah, this impacts everything on both the buyer and the seller side and the builder side I should add. So we're so builders are reluctant to build. We're seeing that decline. There's a long standing problem for builders getting permits. And you're right. There's this lock-in effect. So if you happen to be a homeowner and I'm lucky enough to be one, I'm older than you guys, of course. Then you probably locked in a mortgage rate of around 3% and you're looking at this market and saying yourself, I'm not going to sell. I'm going to go out of my way to stay where I am and keep that keep that where it is. So as with many other things we talk about on our area every day, we need to get to the other side of the feds tightening cycle. I think we need to see when that the fed is finally feels like it's it's gone far enough. And then we can get through through this difficult period. And you know, at some point it's reasonable to think interest rates are going to come back down again. It might take a recession to do that. I mean, I've seen some economists saying, yeah, we think the fed will basically finish up by late this year or early next year. And then it could be cutting rates again if we actually get into a recession in 2023. So, you know, things do change in the housing market, but these are long shifts. This is not like stocks. These are long shifts. We're talking six, nine, 12 months to get to the other side of this. Congrats here at Home Ownership, Rick Newman. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Hi guys. It has been a year to forget and tech as you can see by the unfolding nest. It's snap. We'll dive more into the space with Alphabet Board Member and former Goldman Sachs top executive Marty Schveznext. The tech sector is firmly in the red and fraught regulation issues layoffs and hiring freezes as inflation and market uncertainty take their toll on the sector. Here to make sense of the tech landscape and the surrounding global economic picture is six street partners vice chairman Marty Chavez. Marty, good to see you again. Look, we've been talking all morning long about this sell off in social media stocks. Of course, snap top of mind there. Help the average investor understand what is happening and when am I at end? Well, I found it helpful as an investor and just around peace of mind to keep my eyes on the long term trends. There's a lot going on. I don't think I can add to it. There's certainly a lot of macroeconomic issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,56,2022-10-21 17:55:45
3873," as an investor and just for my own peace of mind to keep my eyes on the long-term trends. And there's a lot going on. I don't think I can add to it. There's certainly a lot of macroeconomic news. And there's the announcement that we all read yesterday. I would just say this is the nature of tech. It is risky. It is growth. It is volatile. It has been on a very long trend. And it was easy and fun to get used to that trend. Who knows where that's going to go in the future. But if you step way back and just look at the long-term trend, I think there's very few predictions that I will make with absolute rock solid confidence. And one of them is that there's going to be more software in the future than there is in the present. And so long-term, it's the same. And there's a lot of ups and downs on the way. That prediction tracks Marty. I appreciate that here this morning. You also have a unique position of sitting on the board at alphabet as well. With that in mind, I just wonder what is the next transformative technology that's really going to be the changing factor for consumers as well for some of the companies that we cover on a daily basis. So one thing that you get to say if you've been at the same thing for a long time is you live long enough to get to be considered a pioneer. And so a long time ago, I was working on AI in medicine. This is back in the late 80s and the early 90s. The compute power was just way too low. And I remember back then there were people working on neural networks. And we used to think, okay, that doesn't seem like that's ever going to work. Well, that has worked unbelievably well. So I, many other people were just dead wrong about neural networks. And what we are able to do, we've all seen with neural networks is amazing. We are just at the very, very beginning of an incredibly exciting upsling. And what we're going to be able to do with AI across the board, whether it's drug discovery, climate change, or at the beginning of actually being able to do amazing, really miraculous things with AI. So that's the future. But right now, you're also kind of looking at this environment where even as we were looking at snaps, earnings, and really reading through where they're impacted as a result of operating system privacy changes that many social media companies have been hit by because of the changes that Apple had put forward. There is another OS that's out there. In fact, there are a few other ones. And one of the other major competing ones is the Android OS. Why is it that there has been more of an impact to the social media companies derivative of privacy changes from the Apple operating system than from any privacy changes because there's also a privacy push within the Android OS as well? Well, I think all companies need to step back and the regulators doing this as well. And look at what privacy means, how to define it, and what we actually want, and to get ready for it. And there's just a whole range of outcomes. This is a huge global social, political decision that we all have to make. And there's so many moving cards. I'd love to predict it, but I would just say to all companies, you have to ready yourself for a large number of different regulatory outcomes. Really, the question is, we know what is possible with AI. What will what does society want us to do with it? And that is a very big decision that's happening right now. There's no one route. It depends on operating systems. It depends on policies. It depends on choices that consumers and companies make. And nobody knows what's going to happen. So you just have to be ready for a variety of outcomes. Already, when the market gets a sense, the Fed is done raising rates for this cycle. What will that mean for the M&A market? Well, so I have somewhat infamous for not making timing predictions. And I think I don't make them because I'm terrible at them. And also causality is hard like knowing this happens. And that's going to happen next and predicting the timing of it. Who knows? Right there. There is M&A happening. There are in every economy, including the one that we currently have, there are difficult spots and there are bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,57,2022-10-21 17:59:53
3874," currently have their difficult spots and their bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations of all kinds, in that area of AI, that is booming, just like probably better than ever. And so there are bright spot screenshots even now in certain sectors and AI is certainly one of them. Marty, we only got about 30 seconds left, but I'd love to know, especially as so many companies are making changes when it comes to diversity, equity and inclusion, whether that be at the entry level, mid management, all the way up to the board. What is the step that a company can take right now in order to ensure that even in the midst of macroeconomic uncertainty, that they are retaining those values? Well, so the companies have the right values in that in general. I'm not going to make a blanket statement, but really it comes down to what are you actually doing day to day in your recruitment and you're filling the pipeline in understanding connected to managing your people. And so companies are doing a much better job at the entry level, though it's still hard, in reflecting the demographics of the cities and environments where they operate. Really, the hard part is as people become more senior in their careers. How do we continue to make them want to be here as opposed to some other place and how we actively manage their careers to mentorship and sponsorship? Those are the things that all companies need to be doing in a disciplined process-oriented way every day through every market cycle. Sixth Street's partner and vice chairman, thanks so much for joining us. Marty Shavez, appreciate the time this morning. Pleasure, do well. Thanks. You guys coming up, we're going to share the full interview with Verizon Wireless CEO, Hans Vestberg on the other side of this short break-in on the back of his company's company's $1,000,000. Verizon closing the books on its third quarter. It reported results before the bell and its stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investors mold the report and weigh the impact of inflation on the wireless providers consumer business. I spoke to Verizon CEO, Hans Vestberg, earlier about the quarter. Take a listen.

3875," I spoke to Verizon CEO Hans Vesper earlier about the quarter. Take a listen. I think we came out from the second quarter. We had some softness in our consumer business, especially on the wireless. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter, especially around new plants, new products, but we also did some price adjustments. Coming into the third quarter and now reporting that, we can see some of that is really getting good effect. We're growing 10% or wireless revenue or EBITA grew 3%, almost 3%, 12.2 billion dollars. Definitely the progress we put in place was actually working, but it's a lot more to do. We're a large company and we need to continue the hard work we're doing right now to continue to do the great cash generation we're doing. That was the highlight of the quarter. We saw also the prepaid market. We acquired a track fund last year, which added a really good asset when it comes to being in the value segment. We had a new product in there, a new product called Total Wireless, but Verizon. We also added home broadband to the prepaid market. Overall, our broadband had a really good quarter. 377,000 new broadband customers in the quarter across business and consumer. That fixed wireless access business we're doing is really working. A lot of things was working for us. We still are working on the consumer segment to be even stronger. We're going to take more actions. It's a very agile market when it comes to consumer segment at the moment. I want to talk a little bit more about that consumer segment as well, Hans. From your perspective, when you think about what you said at the end of the second quarter, mid-summer, second half challenges, you were looking out into the future and saying that second half challenges, you see them as short-term. Is that still the case? Or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer, especially as they're paying more for necessities right now, and the macroeconomic climate that you believe might protrude into 2023 or even beyond? It's a little bit mixed feelings, actually. We have the highest quality customer base and the largest consumer base in the country. We see really good payment from our customers, consumers, where we are actually better than pre-COVID. So we don't see anything there. We actually see the roaming when people are traveling abroad. That movements are equally big or higher than pre-COVID. So a lot of things are moving as normal and are store traffic between Q2 to Q3. That increased with double digits. So people are actually doing movement. Then of course, we all read what's happening in the macroeconomy with higher inflation and the interest rate is coming up. So it's a little bit mixed, but clearly we are in the fundamental product. Everybody needs mobility. Everybody needs to be connected. That's so important for us and even more important these days. So clearly, there are mixed feelings. We think we have a great product, we have a great network, and we are spanning all the consumer segments. And then not forget our business side. That has a really good quarter with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the business group. But not only that. I did 200,000 new, almost 200,000 new net-dads, full net-dads in the business segment. So it's a little bit mixed when you read in the market and what we're seeing in our customer base. Certainly. I want to talk a little bit more about those network investments in a moment. But before that, we know that you're one of the largest partners with Apple in terms of the iPhone, the latest edition of this consumer device and the smartphone that comes out year after year. And within that, there's even been some of the reports around where the demand might be pulling back. Are you seeing that show up in your business at all right now? Now, when we come to the iPhone 14 launch, we have seen very normal volumes. But moreover, we actually made an exclusive deal with Apple, which we have done over a long time. We're Apple 1 for our unlimited. It's a new offering where you have all the Apple services, Apple Plus, the gaming, etc. In one package together with our unlimited. Very good for us to get the with Apple. So now we're very normal. There's a little bit of mix, of course, which type of products our customers are taking. But in general, very normal levels of a launch of an iPhone. It's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,59,2022-10-21 18:08:35
3876," Very normal. There is a little bit of mix of course which type of products our customers are taking but in general very normal Levels over over lunch of an iPhone if you were coming back to the the network infrastructure investments that you're making as well If we were to see any kind of recessionary concerns Really permeate over into the next year What would that mean in terms of the moderation of the level of network investments that you might be making and and perhaps on the other and where your full steam ahead? I think that the last six seven years we have at the plan exactly how we're going to invest in the network This is our peak year. We're going to do some somewhere between around 22 billion in Capex that's our guidance And that's one portion is our business as usual and then the other is that the new spectrum we bought last year Is actually coming to execution right now and we're doing that as fast as we can and next year that will will come down So but we have invested in fiber. We are investing in the CBAN the spectrum we bought We're going to pass 200 million pop in the first quarter on our CBAN and the important with the CBAN That's a five-despictrum that we're using we see good growth on that so where we launch a market with the CBAN We see mobility Business growing we see fixed-wise access growing and for the viewers Important we we bought that spectrum but we get it all the time as the satellite companies are releasing it and the last piece of that spectrum We will get at the end of 2023, but basically it's nationwide 160 megahertz which is a lot of spectrum and we're only deploying a piece is over right now But by year and 2023 will have also we have a clear process of how we implement and execute in our in our network And that's on number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for a network We're already have the best network and it's just getting better So just lastly while we have you here I got a hustle to my finish here But I'm taking a look at the stock price investors clearly reaction to this morning's earnings report and perhaps they may be paying Attention to some of the churn in end users or subscribers But they also may be paying close attention to the margins as related to some of the cap ex that's going to be Set forth and continues to be earmarked to the tune of 2020 22 billion dollars that you just mentioned When do you believe either some of the churn will start to alleviate and then on the other side when you can start to Adequately wind down perhaps some of the spending so that the margins aren't as compressed So when it comes to our shurn in the in the third quarter that was expected We took a deliberate decision in a second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments And we knew that we would have a shurn bubble so so that that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision We took and it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever So this was the time to do it we did it for certain segments So that will ease over over time So I think that's a very important message and when it comes to the the the cap ex we have a clear plan We will come back of course with exact guidance for 23 but we're very clear plan how we are on the peak level of spending right now and then it will come down as we are Spending as fast as we can and deploying the C band Spectrum that we bought a year ago All right, the Supreme Court has rejected a request made to block the Biden administration's program for student debt relief As has a district court yellow finances legal correspondent Lexus Keenan has the latest Lexus Hi, Brian.

3877," Alright, our line earnings coming in hot, the theme park space may be worth another little bit of fine investors more on this straight ahead. Theme parks have had a rocky year as they look to bounce back from the lows of COVID-19 and our next guest says estimate need to come down to a better reflect the challenges ahead. City Research Director James Hartman joins us now James good to see you again right in the middle of a fright fest for six flags and it's been a very frightful year for that company they have really been struggling how do you think this quarter shaped up? Yeah I mean and you're right it has been a tough year for these guys they had a new strategy where they're essentially aiming to have fewer customers right but the strategy that we know that's not a good strategy here we don't want to let you in but take less business we're okay with that. That's right is that we'll we dove the Jeremy Wires strategy. You were more more profits better service that may have made more sense come into this year it's been I think it's been a tough sell as some of these macro pressures have mounted and so to answer your question I do think it's a tough third it was a tough third quarter for these guys I think estimates probably are too high I think attendance if anything it was pretty pretty bad in the second quarter anything there's a good chance that I got worse here in 3Q James for the lay person following this six-flets story and the CEO made some just bizarre comments on that last earnings call but push out its side what is wrong with six flags is it the the stands where they get the food are the rides not cool enough is it a combination of all that or is it just too expensive to go to these parks? Yeah I think it's a it's a combination of all of those things relative to other theme parks six flags has historically not been able to get the pricing that that those others have in that they would hope to particularly since they cater to you know some of the the biggest cities in the US with some of the best disposable income it tends to be a lot more teenager oriented as opposed to family oriented and I think that plays a role in terms of the pricing that they're able to get you know there's an argument to be made that they haven't invested enough in their parks over the years and that has also led to this sort of lower quality experience at least that being the perception and so",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,61,2022-10-21 18:19:31
3878," over the years and that has also led to this sort of lower quality experience, at least that being the perception. And so I think that's all what predated this new concept that they ultimately had. They didn't put it this way, but that they fired their customers in a lot of ways. And you got to be real careful with that, suffice it to say. That's bad news for the Dippin' Dot Barometer, James. When we think about some of the other major theme parks that are out there, I mean, what is going to be vastly different between this year and next year? This was supposed to be that travel-demand boom year, that revenge-experience-show-economy year. If not this year, then what does that shape up for next year for the theme parks? Yeah, it's such a great point. I mean, we were believers that there was this pent-up demand as we exited the pandemic for exactly these types of experiences. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of daylight between the post-pandemic phase or story and the pre-recession or recession story. And I think that's those two things ultimately pointed up against each other here in the summer of 22. I've got numbers lower for next year. We have seen pretty consistently over the course of the summer slowing demand trends for the theme parks. Now, the good news is I do think that these companies, these businesses tend to hold in better than some of the other discretionary names that I follow. And so they're going to feel it. I think attendance is likely to be down. Sales are likely to be down. But they generally hold in pretty well. And the reason for that is they tend to be trained down beneficiaries. As opposed, once travel turns over, if in fact it does, these tend to be cheaper alternatives than going to Orlando or Mexico or Europe. James, what you often see in a lot of these theme park parking lots is when a bigos family take these when a bigos and they go to the theme parks. Now, that is the stock you cover. This company just reported earnings. Take us through their inventory situation. Are they able to get the semiconductors and the supplies they need to get these trucks or these mobile homes out of the showrooms and into the front porches or the dryways of customers? Yeah, I mean, so that was the narrative for so much of 2021 in the early part of 2022. But they get the supply out there because there was very much to believe that true demand was better than these reported retail numbers. IE, if you had more product, you could sell more product. I think that narrative has changed over the past three months and, and oh, by the way, I don't think it's just for RVs. I think the ability to stock showroom floors has improved dramatically. And if you want to get one of these, you can get one of these right now. I think that the, it's a double head sword now, though. The concern is that these manufacturers will pump up the channel too much with some of these inventories. And that would ultimately turn make a bad situation worse as we think about a potential recession. And again, it's not just RVs. I think this whole debate as to are we are aren't we heading towards a recession? In what I cover, right, big ticket discretionary. In a lot of ways, it feels like we're there or, or vastly quickly approaching that place. It does seem like over the past few months, supply has improved, but the demand has not. All right. Well, for those of us brining myself included who are priced out of the housing market, the RVs are looking to be good. I'm Neil Baby. Yeah. City Research Director James Hardman, thanks for taking the time here today. Have a great weekend. Thanks, guys. Guys, coming up, we're going to do a roundup of the top things that we've heard this week from some key business leaders, from everything from our all market summit to kick off the week through to, yeah, today's conversations with some big CEOs as well. It's next. All right, bro.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,62,2022-10-21 18:23:59
3879," 🎵 to Yahoo Finance, everyone. It was an energizer-bundet type of week here for us here on the morning show as we spoke with a numerous amount of executives, including CEOs from Bank of America. We had Proctor and Gamble, Target, or Tarje, and Hilton all seeming to be optimistic surrounding recession chances, and the current state of the consumer. Here's what they had to say. They have pushed that projection for recession out a little bit into 23, but their core belief it's a mild recession. So purely from a consumer demand and willingness to spend the standpoint, we wouldn't predict a recession. The hope is, it allows the Fed, at some point, over the next six or 12 months, to sort of stabilize, having done their job with inflation more in control, and allow the economy to get its footing again and start a process of re-acceleration. They continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays, and we know they're out on the streets of New York, they're in restaurants, they're in our stores. So right now, we're seeing a stable environment. So there was a ton to really be extrapolated from those conversations, whether it was during our all market summit to kick off the week, or even later on as we move through early season, but particularly one of the threads was where the Fed policy is going to continue to actually impact the consumer in this near term, and what that actually does for the economy to change the demand profile or the demand cycle that we find ourselves in as relates to these companies' financial performance. Yeah, we talked about it earlier, Brad. I think we got a taste to that in that really major profit warming for a whirlpool. Again, those are big ticket purchases that you put on credit cards, heard it from Gen. Rack, earlier in the week, but what is interesting, I'll just call up Target as well, Brian Cornell, Chairman and CEO, telling us he's a stable business, but how stable is it next year? Let's say there's a Target store next to Snap headquarters or where Snap employees work. They just missed their quarter because of pressure on online spending because the economy is slowing down. That person now lost their job. Are they still spending at the same rate after this holiday season at Target that they were this year unclear, which speaks to the bigger thing. This is a very challenging earning season. It is really hard to truly understand what is going on inside corporate America. It's a hard earning season, but at the same time for us and the conversations, I mean, the questions that we're asking are definitely trying to just get a different sense of where there actually is some of that vulnerability, how they're managing through that, and then on the other side of that, what kind of company is emerging on the other side of that economic downturn or macroeconomic challenge that continues to be cited here? More big convos to come next week. Well, that is it for myself and Brad.

3880," or economic challenge that continues to be cited here. More big convos to come next week. Well, that is it for myself and Brad. Coming up, the Kiko Fujita will speak with two analysts about the state of the semiconductor sector. You won't want to miss it. Have a great weekend. Thanks for your time. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Friday to all of you. It's 11 am here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Snap, crackle, flop. Shares of the social media company plummet. As declining ad revenue and widening losses way on investors, we're going to discuss the numbers and implications for wider tech. Musk under scrutiny. The Biden administration reportedly considers national security reviews for the Tesla CEO as questions swirl around foreign investors involved with the Twitter buyout. And chip disruption. New US tech controls threatened to shake up the global semiconductor industry. As companies scrambled to be in compliance, we've got a paddle standing by for you to discuss the implications. First though, let's check in on the market action. We are 90 minutes into the trading day, of course. Trying to round out the week here on a positive note. We've got the Dow up 151 points. The S&P 500 up 9. The Nasdaq the only one in the red. The yield on the 10 year treasury note, one to really note today climbing to a level we have not seen in 14 years. We also saw a big jump in the 30 year yield. But we've seen a bit of a pull back off the highs in part because of some of the comments that we have gotten from Fed officials. There's that Wall Street Journal report that came out that pointed to potential concerns within our among Fed officials about over tightening and how aggressively they're moving. And that could be partly what we're doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,64,2022-10-21 18:32:45
3881," That came out that pointed to potential concerns within our MungFed officials about over tightening and how aggressively they're moving. And that could be probably what we're seeing the levels right now but the 10-year yield still at 4.24%. Moving on to our top story of the hour. It is all about snap and take a look at where shares are trading right now down more than 30% following its mis-on-revenue estimates for the third quarter. The social media company citing continued deceleration of revenue growth as a result of ongoing challenges that include platform policy changes, macroeconomic headwinds, and increased competition. Joining us now for a snapshot of the path ahead for staff. We've got Jason Halstein, up in Heimer Managing Director and Head of Internet Research. Jason, you know, this certainly was not a great quarter but this is a steep fall for this company. Shares are down more than 30%. How much of this do you think is overdone? Look, I think the challenges and investors are kind of asking themselves, do they want to support this company longer term? I think one of the questions we get from investors is, you know, will they ever put ads in messaging? I think it's pretty well known. We all know we use all of us use messaging products, right? And we generally don't see ads in messaging products. And so, and a lot of this company's use case is at the messaging tool, right? When they do then try to take that activity and get you to spend time using spotlight and using discover, but they're also seeing a ton of competition there from TikTok and others. And so, when you couple together, the 5% decline in US time spent with kind of revenue that was below expectations, and kind of monthly trend that investors are having a really hard time to salary, you know, I think you're having investors trying to decide, do they want to underwrite the stock longer, the company longer term? Jason, there are two key issues that have really persisted from quarter to quarter this year. One is, of course, the slowdown that we've seen in ad spending to the point you just made. Also, the other one is about this company being able to navigate these changes that have taken part as a result of the privacy guardrails that are now in place through Apple's iOS. I mean, these are not new problems that came up during this quarter. And I wonder if you think we've taken away anything more based on that earnings call yesterday about how much worse things are about to get particularly for Snap? Yeah, we think kind of the Apple privacy is a good excuse but not the main reason. That really only affects, for the most part, app downloads or advertisers trying to drop downloads. The bulk of Snapchats advertising is brand advertising. And that's what's been bouncing around kind of month among in kind of an unpredictable way. And they're telling you that they expect their brand advertising to slow as they move through the quarter, right? And so that is the issue. And then they're also telling you that effectively competition is still a threat to time spent. And so this quarter, you saw impressions slowed. Not a ton, they were up 8% item of ads sold versus 9% less quarter. But then price spread was down 3% versus up 4% in the second quarter. And they're kind of telling you that they think those metrics will slow, right? It's basically flat revenue growth in the back half. And it's not the fourth quarter. And it's not all currency. currency was about two points of headwind. So there's definitely, I'd say more companies specific factors. And obviously we'll know more next week when Alphabet and Meta report, but we don't expect kind of as bad of an outlook from Meta because they will be comparing against what was a challenging period last year. Well, and let's pick up on that point because when you look at the other social media stocks, they are falling today in tandem with Snap, not to the levels that we're seeing in terms of declines in the Snap Stock. But Alphabet, you mentioned Meta, Pinterest, another one that's been coming down as well. We've learned in the last quarter that this isn't Snap isn't always a bell weather, partly because these other names are a little more diversified. I mean, what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen? Who's best position?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,65,2022-10-21 18:36:49
3882," This isn't snap isn't always a bell weather partly because these other names are a little more diversified I mean what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen? Who's best position to write out the macro headwinds? Yeah, I mean to your point, you know, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized Obviously not not as bad as a snap is but kind of down, you know four or five six percent depending on the company We actually do like meta the past right now for playing digital advertising within large cap in front of the quarter Mostly because they already took their loans a year ago, right? So they were the most impacted by Apple's privacy changes They called out at 10 percentage point kind of impact to them They also benefited the most during the pandemic from the poll forward in e-commerce Spending any commerce advertising and that has unwound as we As the economy is reopened you look at the monthly data on retail sales e-commerce isn't growing any faster than overall retail sales So that's kind of telling you that they're still kind of like a hangover there And so we think as that starts to obey and you've easier calms We think the setup is is pretty good for meta and then the last thing is we are waiting for Apple to kind of update It's called SCAD network 4.0. It's the next Technology tool to improve Tracking of ads and and performance data and we think meta is the best position company to take advantage of that for their advertiser So we are optimistic on meta in front of the quarter Okay, well we're watching for those numbers when they come out next week Jason health scene up and Hymer managing director and head of internet Research appreciate the time Thank you Well, let's not turn to the broader markets. We've got fed officials now moving forward Towards another rate hike of point 75 percentage points at the November meeting We've got Yahoo Finance as Jared liqueur is always on top of this and yield certainly been the focus of the week But yet again today we're talking about a level we haven't seen in 14 years Yes, and let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive. I'm plotting the US dollar index We're gonna circle around to currencies in a second because what we're talking about in terms of bonds very closely link with Currencies and there are spillover effects into equities everything is linked here So here's a US dollar index appreciated 17% versus this basket of currencies Mainly weighted towards a euro, but very illustrative of what's been going on here Here's a 10-year Tino yield it looks very similar to that US dollar chart In fact, they're very correlated hitting 4.22 percent now it has backed off a little bit higher number than that But as you said at Keiko most of these bond yields we have not seen since 2007 through 2011 I can put you I can show the five year That's down nine basis points a 30 year that is up base eight basis points So we have a lot that's happening with the yield curve right now and essentially it has been flattening And let me just point you I'm gonna put up the US dollar one more time here And I have some comments from Norte that I want to go over because we are caught in an effects Loop here and this has to do with respect This has to do with the Bank of Japan now Norte is taking a look at this countries They're saying do not have an endless amount of US dollars at disposal to sell meaning that effects intervention will fail when the US dollar Coffers run dry this is from the perspective of these central bankers over in Japan They have amassed a war chest of US dollars. They also hold 1.2 trillion dollars in US treasuries very important here So Norte going on to say more over effects intervention involves selling US treasuries That's to get US dollars which adds upward pressure on US rates That's because rates are inverse to bond prices stick with me one more second here This leads to a stronger US dollar and isolation this affects Intervention intervention US US dollar doom loop doom loop illustrated here I'll show you the picture in a second could lead to dollar overshooting especially when central banks are Enforcing the loop so here we go weaker yen sales of US treasuries higher US dollar rates weaker yen and the cycle Continues and that's what we've been seeing here And this the spillover effects as I mentioned with respect to equities These leveraging actions right here. We're not going to see a bit on equities until all of this is done and the central bankers Have been very flat-footed about the response so far. Yeah the BOJ in even tougher position given the data We got today right eight year high inflation not at the level that we're seeing in the US But still they've got a very dovish policy in place. They've got the yen continuing to weaken against the job",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,66,2022-10-21 18:41:06
3883," should give them the data we got today, right? Eight-year high inflation, not at the level that we're seeing in the US, but still, they've got a very dovish policy in place. They've got the Yen continuing to weaken against the dollar and then now that they're looking at it. We didn't get to it, but the Yen very volatile today, maybe an intervention that we don't know about going on right now. Okay, something to watch. Thanks so much for that, Jared. Well, at the time now for our trending ticker and we're seeing weaker than expected subscriber numbers, weighing on shares of Verizon. That stock is down more than 6%. And hitting a 52 week low today, the largest wireless carrier added just 8,000 monthly subscribers in the most recent quarter as competitors offered aggressive promotions to take away market share. That prompted Verizon to offer its own discounts and introduce low-cost mobile phone service and internet plans. There's what CEO Hans Besberg had to say on customer churn this morning. We took a deliberate decision in a second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments. And we knew that we would have a show on Bob Bell. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took. And it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments. So that will ease over over time. So I think that's a very important message. broadband proved to be a bright spot for the quarter for Verizon. The company added another 343,000 wireless home internet customers in the quarter. Well, coming up, the result season stealing the headlines this week, but investors keeping a very close watch on the bond market as a 10-year treasury yield hits levels we haven't seen in 14 years. We're going to talk to market strategy on the other side. If you're interested in software and technology. Such a kal Kai bill has been covered not being sent on by the It's not quite finished raising its target rate as inflation remains stubborn leaned high. Meanwhile, a fresh report in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests some federal officials are signaling unease with",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,67,2022-10-21 18:45:53
3884," It's not quite finished raising its target rate as inflation remains stubbornly high. Meanwhile, a fresh report in the Wall Street Journal this morning suggests some fed officials are signaling unease with big rate rises. So is this the first sign of the long-awaited pivot? Joining us to discuss is Emily Roland, co-chief investments for just a John Hancock investment management. Emily, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on this report that came out from the journal today about the debate that's happening. Whether you, in fact, think that the data that we have gotten, the latest data points to the need for at least a pause in the hikes. Yeah, the volatility in the rate market today has been nothing short of astonishing. We woke up to this continued backup and interest rates that has been playing out over the last few days. And then this journal article comes out suggesting that potentially the Fed is going to be leaning towards 50 basis points in December, instead of 75, at least discussing that at the November Fed meeting here. So, you know, we think that it's right to consider a pause. And you even heard, Lail Brainerd earlier about a week ago talking about the fact that, you know, maybe we are a pause is potentially warranted here as some of the monetary policy decisions start to really work their way into the economy. And it's important to recognize that Fed policy works the long and variable lag. The Fed just started tightening in March of this year and they've implemented the most aggressive amount of tightening that we've seen in the generation in a really, really short amount of time. We want to watch to see how that actually filters into the economy before the Fed just continues down this path of aggressive tightening. How much of that have we actually seen filter through the economy based on what you've seen? Well, we look at the leading economic indicators and we just saw another negative readings. We've had three negative readings in a row here for the leading indicators. And that's the just that we are in a significantly decelerating economic growth climate. The challenge is that the Fed uses by nature of their mandates lagging economic data. So they're looking at the fact that the unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent near a 50 percent lower low, they're looking at CPI data, which just continues to be. And they're big component of that, of course, is the housing market shelter, which tends to be a very sticky component of inflation. It takes time to show up in the data. And the Fed is marching down this path of dampening inflation, really at any cost, but that's the key question at what cost. And they're looking like they're going to keep going until something breaks. I mean, the other big challenge, of course, comes down to messaging. And that's been a bit tricky when you think about how things played out over the summer. You know, now we know that the Fed officials didn't feel like the markets were simply getting the message. We got that very strong message at Jackson Hole. Since then, it's sort of been we're going to continue to hike rates until inflation comes down. How do you think they told the line here? If in fact there is some kind of pause to at least message to the markets, this doesn't mean a pivot. This is just a slowdown. It's such a great question because the messaging and the forward guidance is so critical. And one of the things we learned from this journal article this morning was that the Fed wants to be careful in avoiding a big upside move in markets based on this perceived Fed pivot. So I think if they do decide to go with 50 in December, it's going to be well telegraphed whether it's through the Wall Street Journal or some other mechanism, because you know, we saw that incredible rallying soft to play it out from mid-June to mid-August for your point there. And it was based on this false hope that the Fed was going to reverse course in quick fashion. And clearly that's not the case. And they've made it quite clear that they're going to keep the gloves off in the fight against inflation until the fight is done. Bottom line, Emily, as we look ahead to the next few months, and what does that mean from an investment standpoint? Is this change at all in terms of your thesis on where things are headed? Or, you know, is this also a time to maybe pause and wait to see where the economic debt all leads? Yeah, I mean, investors are feeling really steestic right now. Is this volatility picked up and we're suggesting...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,68,2022-10-21 18:49:45
3885," to see where the economic debt elites. Yeah, I mean, investors are feeling really specific right now is this volatility picked up and we're suggesting to them that they should focus on the horizon, which to us really means looking at the income on high quality bonds as something that's pretty competitive versus the other alternatives out there. You know, we used to talk about China. There's no alternative for so low. There was no other alternative, but to buy stocks and we would argue today that there is no alternative to bond. Yes, price pressures are there, but the fact that you can get five six percent income on high quality bonds right now, we think it's awfully competitive. You know, you look at the dividend yield on the S&T 500, which is less than 2%. So we want to move up the capital structure. We want to get paid income as we wait out this more and we want to get paid. So I'm going to take aways there. Emily Roland, Co-Chief Investment Stragist, John Hancock Investment Management. Good to talk to you today. Okay. There's even more trouble for Elon Musk ahead. The US government reportedly considering whether it should review Musk's newfound empire. That includes his ongoing deal for social media site Twitter and SpaceX's satellite network. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, Alexis Keenan, who's tracking this. Alexis, let's start with what's happening with Twitter because this is an interesting one given that the concern is really about who's part of this investment group for Twitter that there are foreign players in here that could potentially signal a conflict. Right. So what Bloomberg is reporting is that US officials in the Abadan administration are concerned about the Twitter deal to the extent that the Saudi Arabian prince Al-Wali Ben-Talal, as well as Binance, which has a Chinese founder and has backing from Cuttersauver and Wealth Fund. So that's where they're saying that according to sources, there are maybe some concerns. Now, they also go on to say that it's not really clear which agency would originate this kind of inquiry. But one of the usual suspects is CIFIAS. That's the committee on foreign investment in the United States. That committee in 2018 was given a lot of expanded authority to conduct these types of threat assessments over possible security concerns that arise from foreign investment in US companies. And they even got expanded authority to look at those multinational deals that result in less than foreign control, which was the former case for the agency, especially they got some authority to look at investments that involve companies that are engaged in technology and personal data. Of course, the Twitter deal would qualify, I would think, perhaps under that standard. Now, the idea that the security review of a security review at all based on national concern, national security concerns, it's been raised previously with respect to Tesla, with respect to SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. But it's the first time we're hearing about it raised with respect to the Twitter deal. That's certainly sparking a lot of questions about whether the government could end up derailing this deal. And certainly part of that contract for the merger between the two companies does require that it surpass any regulatory and government review. So that's getting a lot of talk here. Elon Musk already tweeting that in response to this Bloomberg piece saying commenting on a Twitter post that said it would be hilarious if the government ended being the one to derail this tie up between Twitter and Musk's companies that he's formed in order to effectuate this merger. Really quickly, Alexis, you know, any of us who have followed these syphias reviews in the past know that this is never a quick turnaround. And we are talking months and months and months of review. If in fact that's triggered, what does that mean for the deal? Well, Akiko, syphias can take a look at transactions that are already happened. So they can go back and try to get some agreements from companies that have already done the deal. So it doesn't necessarily stop the deal from going forward. But the government could also intervene and say we would let us get out of the contract.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,69,2022-10-21 18:54:06
3886," agreements from companies that have already done the deal. So it doesn't necessarily stop the deal from going forward, but the government could also intervene and say we would like to have some things ironed out before it does commence. So we'll certainly be watching the deadline that the court has put on the deal, which is October 28th next Friday, one week from today. But look, yes, it could go on for a very long time, these types of inquiries, but it doesn't mean that it just stops the deal and it's tracks. Okay, thanks getting a little more complicated there. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, upscale electricity. If you like trucks and want something like a Hummer, then not exactly a Hummerable GMC might have the thing for you. Yahoo! Finances, pros, supermanians, going to have a story for us on the other side. The competition in the EV space is revving up. General Motors unveiled its latest electric truck yesterday, the 2024 GMC Sierra EV. It's now taking reservations for the $107,000 fully loaded version called the Sierra EV Denali Edition. Thankfully, we've got pros, supermanians, to break down all the details for us. That is a hefty price tag, but it's not the only truck on the market. That's an EV. How does it compare? Well, you know, it's, it's twin is basically this Silverado, the Chevy Silverado, which I find to have a design that's more adventure, lifestyle truck. Whereas if you look at the the new Sierra EV over here, it's more traditional truck like, looks like a work truck. I think it might appeal to a broader set of people. Power wise, it actually has more power than the top one, Silverado has around 750 horsepower, 400 miles of range in that top trim. So that's pretty competitive, but you did mention that price, $107,000, that top tier, it's very pricey, very high and very premium, I would say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,70,2022-10-21 18:58:45
3887," of range in that top trim. So that's pretty competitive. But you did mention that price $107,000 for that top tier. It's very pricey, very high and very premium, I would say. But I did get a chance to speak to the chief engineer, Nicole Kratz, about lower trim levels that are actually going to compete against the Ford Lightning Pro. Here's what you'd say. $50,000 model for the Sierra EV is an elevation. It's an elevation trim, so it's not a work truck in the standpoint of a $50,000 model. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live on this Friday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith alongside Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed on the market action as we get ready to close out. What has been a rather volatile week here for the market? But looking at today's gains, you can see the Dow up 600 and 36 point to the amp. The S&P up just around 2% the Nasak also pushing higher up just around 1.8% some comments from a San Francisco Fed president, Mary Daley, taking as a bit dovish here for the market. She didn't say that she would like the Fed to be able to quote step down on the pace of rate hikes going forward. That was enough to boost stocks here in afternoon trading. You can see the Nasak up just around 1.8% for the S&P over the past five days. You're looking at a gain of just over 4% with the S&P on track for its best week that we've seen since June. Take a look at the Russell 2000, the small cap index also pushing to the upside for the week up just over 3%. Let's take a look at what's going on in the bond market. You're looking at the 10 year yield putting back just a bit off around two basis points to 421, the 30 year here. It's just a bit higher up just around 8 basis points. When you take a look at some of the sector action that we're seeing. Let's first take a look at it on an intraday basis. So we're looking at materials, energy, financials, leading the way all 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the upside on the 5-day basis. So so far this week, energy by far the winner up just around 8% technology, not too far behind. You're looking at healthcare bringing up the rear up just around 1.8%. So really broad based gains today and buying that we saw not only today, but really what we've seen over the last five trading days. Maybe a misinterpretation of Mary Daly's comment. I think it was. I think they're searching for anything. I look we've had brutal Fridays quite frankly. We're going to turn it around. We'll take this one. Thank you Sean. Alright, let's get you up to speed now on the snap crash. The social media stock plummeting 30% following.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,71,2022-10-21 19:02:55
3888," Brutal Fridays, quite frankly. We have. We're going to turn things around. We'll take this one. Thank you, Sean. All right. Let's get you up to speed now on the snap crash. The social media stock plummeting 30% following a disappointing Q3 earnings report. Snapchat revenue grew just 6%. That's the smallest since the 2017 IPO. And losses surged 400% to $360 million in Part 2. $255 million restructuring charge. If you'll remember, snap announced it would cut 20% of its staff in August. It's roughly 6,000 employees. Jeffers analysts Brent Thale telling Yahoo Finance this morning they may have to go deeper than that. Snap shares now down 83%. This year, other social media stocks feeling the pain is well today metafelling less than 2% Pinterest down 7%. And Twitter also saw more than 4% decline largely on some other concerns, which we will address later in the program. But the ad environment's certainly not helping here. Over now to Jared Bickery is going to get us up to speed on the currency market. Jared, what do we see? Yes. Well, currencies are tied to bonds. They're tied to everything else. So let's take a look. I want to start with the Dow here. You mentioned some of the negative action that we've had on Fridays. Guess what? Not today. Like you said, traders are seizing on those very, very, very slightly dovish comments by Mary Daly. But also a Yen intervention that we got according to the NEC, the Bank of Japan, Interved in the currency market. So let me just go to the Yen here and let's see if I can find this. There we go. That's versus the UN. Here's the US dollar versus the Japanese yen. Now we had broken above the key 150 level. This is a level that has not been breached since 1990. And shortly after that happened earlier this morning, I was sitting with the Kiko Fijita. At the desk here, there was a huge reversal. Let me just show you how that looked. There was this big downleg, a little bit of a reversal there. And we got considerably lower. Now, if you take a look at a six months chart, you can see, well, this happened before. And what happened after that? A couple of weeks later, back to New Hyes. The US dollar was back to New Hyes versus the Yen. All of this is to say that the central bankers for all of the talk, for all of the actions, they haven't really done anything just yet. It's a market's maybe getting ahead of themselves. So we'll have to see if anything comes of this. I've been tweeting about it today. I'm going to be writing about the intervention over the weekend. I just want to get back to the market action today. Shauna went over the sector action. Let's take a look at the Nasdaq. We have Amazon up 3% Microsoft. Microsoft hop 2% Apple up 2% looking at the five day view. Really about the mega cap. So we are looking at some decent gains this week. And I think traders are going to take that. All right, Chair. Thanks so much for that. Let's talk about the broader market moves, what we're seeing play out in the markets today. Really what we've seen over the last several months. And for that, we want to bring in a Thomas Petrophy. He's interactive brokers founder and chairman. Thomas, it's great to see you. So I think we're all trying to make sense of the gains that we're seeing today and comparing that to the losses that we've seen really since the start of the year. The S&P still off just around 21% year to date. What's your assessment of where we stand today? Well, it's very hard to understand these gains because I think optimism is just too strong here because you know that the Fed has to has to rain in inflation. And and they are very far from having done that. So they still have a long way to go and those higher interest rates are certainly going to be earnings in the first, second, and third. And third quarter of next year and estimates will have to come down accordingly. And if you put 15 multiple unto those adjusted earnings, I don't really see the market much above 3000 on the S&P. So how much further do you think the markets have to fall Thomas? I think that it's going to get close to 3000. So that's 10 to 20% lower from here. Thomas, what do you make of the moves that the Fed has made so far because there's lots of debate about how far the Fed has gone if there is this risk that the Fed is going to overshoot? Do you think they've been too aggressive up to this point? I don't think they have been too aggressive. Maybe that would be aggressive in the future.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,72,2022-10-21 19:07:13
3889," Shoo, do you think they've been too aggressive up to this point? I don't think they have been too aggressive. Maybe they'll be aggressive in the future, but so far, look, the economy really hasn't slowed down much as a result of these rate increases and they really want to dampen down retail consumer demand. And once they succeed in doing that, then inflation will slow down, but that will show up in the sales figures for the big tech companies and most consumer goods companies. So, the Fed president, Mary Daly, San Francisco, really rallied the markets. How dovish did you hear these comments? It's time to start talking about stepping down. The time has now to start planning for stepping down. I think that is the wrong message. I think the Fed has to send the message that we're going to stamp out in place no matter what. And if they are in a better position, if they can scare the market into easing up on spending rather than having to force them to ease up on it. So, I don't think the Fed is very happy right now. And Thomas, and with all of that in mind, the fact that you're saying that the S&P could fall to 3,000, I'm curious what you're seeing from your customers, from the retail investor perspective. What are they doing at a time when there's so much uncertainty in the market? So, our core customers who are basically professional traders who work on the trading desks of many of the large investment banks around the world. And they hedge the report fully early on this year. And as the market has been pulling, they just recently started to cover those hedges very slowly. Unfortunately, the retail investors got really hurt and they are not the sidelines. Now, as far as the market going from here, it's generally accepted by the professional traders. The market, as I said, has another 10 to 20% to go down, but it is impossible to pick a button. And so, they have to pick a range of prices at which they gradually get back into the market using like interactive group brokers, as all kinds of algorithms that you can set up to buy, scale down, and falling price, or sales scale up in a range of pricing, pricing prices. So, yeah, it's So, based on the volume of TD Ameritrade and Charles Swab, the Wall Street Journal headline reads, time for day traders to go back to their day jobs. Overall, do you agree without assessment? And when do you think they come back? Well, I agree with the assessment day traders. Yes, they trade their, I mean, look, day traders don't do better or worse in an upmarket versus in a downmarket. So, day traders are just there to try to get the swing of things. And you know, the ones that cannot make a living, of course, they have to go back to their day jobs. But, you know, much of these day trading is now migrated over to the options markets where you can easily, you know, set up option spreads like buying one strike selling another where your risk and profit is limited. But you can take advantage of shorter moves without having to take too much of a risk. So, I think that the conventional day traders has moved from the stock market to the option market. And Thomas, as I take a look at your most recent earnings report, obviously, a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,73,2022-10-21 19:11:24
3890," the conventional data has moved from the stock market to the option market. And Thomas, as they take a look at your most recent earnings report, obviously a beat there. The street rewarded the stock. We saw some appetite for the stock as a result of those earnings. Just what's your assessment of your business at this point during the current quarter? And what does it look like as we look ahead to 2023? So, our business looks pretty good because we have more and more larger professional customers, like hedge funds coming onto our platform. And that is very helpful. So, we have spent several decades automating everything in the business so we can offer our services very, very inexpensively. And so we're finally getting the benefit of it because people are recognizing that IBKR is the platform to go to. All right, we'll have to leave it there. Interactive brokers, founder, Thomas Petrifi, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Enjoy the weekend. Just getting started here on Yahoo!

3891," I'll let's check the markets as we wrap up the week. It's a free-fry Friday, which is why they're rallying so much. Obviously, up more than 600 points on the Dow, the S&P up nearly 2% and the NASDAQ also up about 2% a strong Friday to wrap up this week. Let's talk about it with young you, mob, BMO, wealth management, US chief strategist, chief investment strategist, good to see us sir. So let's discuss this rally to end the week. Largely, we perceive on the perception that Mary Daly, San Francisco, Fed President's comments were dovish. What do you make of the rally? Well, it's welcome, certainly. And I think there are a lot of work participants that have had a lot of challenging days. And so a day like today is certainly a good relief. But if we look at more toward the median picture, we still have, as your previous guests said, a lot of inflation pressures. The Fed still has a lot of work to do and interest rates are still rising. So we're not putting all that much stock into this one day, but it's certainly welcome and we'll take it. Well, young you, what do you make then of the next couple of weeks, the next couple of months in terms of the fact that the Fed's going to stay more aggressive? The 75-base point hike seems like a short thing at this point at the next meeting. Is that going to trigger a sell off? I think the 75-base point is pretty much baked in and the big discussion now is on December meeting, whether it'll be 50 or 75-base point. But I think if we take a step back, the market's in a bit of a catch-22, because if we want earnings to stay stable, given the cost that companies are facing now, both wage pressures, other input costs as well, for them to pass those costs on is what's necessary for earnings to stay stable and passing those costs on mean inflation. And that means the Fed has to continue to be aggressive. So we're in this push and pull dynamic here that's not easy to get out of until we get much better inflation readings. Interesting. A huge week of earnings next week, but in the rear view mirror, what's the lesson, the thematic lesson that you've seen in earnings so far in Q3? Well, expectations came down a lot. I think that's the important thing to remember. If you strip out the energy sector, they went from about a positive 6% back in July for this quarter's earnings all the way down to I think maybe 3%. And so once you lower the bar that much, it does set up an environment where it's a lot easier to beat earnings, a lot easier to have relief rallies. But the problem is, when we go into Q4, if we continue to get downgrades and lower the bar, we'll go through the same pattern that we went through leading up to this quarter, which is a challenging environment. So I think the themes are, there's some stability. Companies are finding ways to manage costs, to pass costs on. But as your previous guest said, there's still a lot of headwinds that remain. And this is going to play out over multiple quarters, not just a couple months. So you're going to get without a mind that what should investors be doing at this point? There are a few areas that we like. And that's a great question. We certainly do like a value as a long term play, even small cap value where valuations are starting to look more attractive. And we're actually looking more favorably on fixed income than we have in a very long time. I think it's gone from an environment where we had a few years ago, what was referred to as Tina, there is no alternative to what I'm calling now as Tara. There's a real alternative. And that real alternative is in the fixed income market. You can get 4% on a two year, about 4.5% on a two year treasury. You can get over 6% and triple B corporates. You can get it around 9%, almost 9% in high yield corporates. Those are starting to look pretty attractive here. So the fixed income market is going to be getting more and more attention as these interest rates continue to rise. John, you have the path narrowed to a soft landing? There is still path to a soft landing. You do want to emphasize that that's still our base case, a soft landing, but that path is narrowing. As interest rates continue to rise and rise sharply as a trajectory for inflation continues to look like it's going to be quite a sticky path ahead. And as global factors and geopolitical factors continue to present problems, that path is starting to narrow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,75,2022-10-21 19:20:10
3892," to look like it's going to be quite a sticky path ahead. And as global factors and geopolitical factors continue to present problems, that path is starting to narrow. But on the positive side, what you want to reiterate, the job market is very strong. Consumer spending should have a floor under it given the strength of the job market. And so there is a path ahead that can lead to a soft landing. But it becomes challenged as interest rates continue to rise. Young, we were talking to Mark Zandee yesterday about when he expects to see inflation significantly cool. And you told us that he expected to be cut in half in about six months. Do you agree with that? I think that's a reasonable estimate. I guess it depends on which measure you're looking at, headline or core. But I don't think the challenge is getting from, say, 6%, 7% inflation down to 3%, 3%, 1,5% inflation. That's not the challenge. I think that's reasonably achievable. I think the challenge that the Fed's going to have is getting from 3%, 3%, 1,5% down to 2%. And that last mile of inflation is really going to be a sticking point because the tightness of the labor market and the other inflation and pressures, supply chain pressures, ensuring you name it, I think that environment speaks to a situation where getting down to 2% is very difficult. So if the Fed sticks to that target, I think there's going to be a considerable amount more work to do. But yeah, being halved in six months seems reasonable. And then of course, the debate out there is whether or not even has to get to 2% in order for the Fed to think that the job is complete. Well, young Yuma, always great, Tavi. Thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Thank you, Sean. Thanks, Dave. Coming up, Toyota issuing a new warning over the chip shortage. We have the details.

Finance is pro supermanian has been following the story for us and pro's more trouble here ahead for Toyota. This chip crisis is still lingering there, especially in Japan. Toyota having to cut its 9.7 million vehicle fiscal forecast for the fiscal year. They are evaluating a new target. They even told us what they are going to cut it to. They are also cutting their monthly outputs. They cut their October output to 800,000. Their November output to 800,000 as well. Cars affected like the Corolla, the RAV4, some Lexus models, even some Camrys. In popular name plates, popular brands across the board are being affected slightly here by their production cut. One note that 9.7 million was an all-time high for the brand. They are optimistic here. It will ask if they made it on 8.6. They are projecting a big 2022, but clearly not happening right now. All right. Prostick around. I want to talk a little bit about Elon. Even by Elon Musk's standards, it has been a very volatile 24 hours. Notably reports suggesting the Biden administration officials are discussing whether his deals should be subject to U.S. national security reviews, including Twitter and SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. According to Bloomberg, one way to do so would be through the law governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States under the Treasury Department. Time is of the essence, Sean. The $44 billion deal for Twitter scheduled to close one week from today. So the timing is certainly interesting to say. The least. Yeah, the timing is certainly interesting. I think there's still a lot of unanswered questions. We talk about this every time just in terms of what from something as basic as what exactly Twitter is going to look like under Musk to how he's going to be able to secure this financing. We know so far. Prostick has had, he's raised about 15 billion in cash from selling part of his stake in Tesla. He's disclosing may filing about $7 billion of financing commitments. But then that does leave a large chunk of change that will still need to be raised in order for this deal to close, in order for him to follow through and buy it for $44 billion. So lots of unanswered questions that we're exactly that money is going to come from and how he's going to get that. Yeah, and that's sort of a more of an overhang in the stock of Tesla stock that he's selling. Those reports he might have to sell in there at $5 to $10 million in Tesla. I'm talking billion. I'm talking billion in Tesla shares to fund the Twitter deal. Coincidentally, this week they talked about buybacks on the earnings call, must say that the board has talked about, we debated it. The board generally thinks it makes sense for a buyback. This look at it do the whole kind of the board approval and the sort of all the kind of looking into how they do that. But it's kind of interesting that that buyback is sort of coinciding with how much money he needs to sort of raise. In the sense that the shareholders a little bit upset about the fact that the, you know, look at Tesla shares this year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,77,2022-10-21 19:28:54
3894, I'm just saying that that that that that buyback is sort of coinciding with how much money he needs to sort of raise in the sense that people the shareholders a little bit upset about the fact that you know look at Tesla shares this year down you know 30% or so. So it's kind of like a problem not only for Twitter but also for Tesla and we just saw right now the journalist publishing a story about how this would be the biggest hung deal in in in debt because people the banks are kind of saddled with the debt and no one wants to buy it right now. So it's both Tesla shares and also debt kind of mixing together in a kind of a problematic buy here for Musk and Twitter. And you're talking about things mixing together. I mean Elon can't stay out of international issues and this is appears to be by design. I mean he is funding the Starlink Internet there in the Ukraine and I said at one point he wants the US government to do it but now he's going to continue to fund it at 20 million dollars a month. Just yesterday he retweeted a Russian national security security council expert Demetri Medvedev who had trolled Liz Truss so he can't help himself in staying out of these things and we haven't even gotten to the fact that there was a Washington Post report suggesting Elon would lay off 75% of Twitter employees Twitter is now telling their employees don't worry about that. That's not on the cards. You are now. Of course are going to worry about that and start freshening your resume. Yeah of course you are and we've already heard some analyst reaction. Janis is out with the notes saying that you can't cut your way to grow simply that that is not going to happen. He went on to say that if we do see must come in and cut in the numbers of that 75% range is going to be way too aggressive in their option doing that coming in and doing that right out of the gate and it's going to take years before this X app strategy takes hold. So if you go and cut 75% of the workforce I mean press that also lends a lot of questions to exactly why he thinks Twitter is going to be able to operate with a 75% reduction in the head count. There are around 7000 or so employees I believe at Twitter but that's significant of a cut. You've got to start scratching your head and say what the heck is Twitter going to potentially look like under months? Yeah I mean he's sort of taking the viewpoint of I'm from California Silicon Valley. I know to fix these things. We can do these better than how Twitter and current management is doing that right now. One thing I want to note about the syphia stuff is I'm going to key about this. You have the kind of like let's say China cracks down on free speech on Twitter and it lenses I don't want to do that. What about your next Chinese factory? Are they going to then step on him on Tesla in order to get him to act on Twitter? So these guys his hands everywhere but that's going to be a problem with regards to that sort of thing. National security concerns are obvious everywhere. Prost thank you good stuff. All right come out American Express Shares following despite reporting and earnings feet find out why when we come back. It's,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,78,2022-10-21 19:33:18
3895," O. Slamifer This time, we're at Triple Play, three stats that we're watching here in the final 30 minutes of trading American Express, Netflix and Hawaiian Airlines, Jared Blyckery. Joining us on Zed to break all of this down my pick today is American Express. The stock actually taking a hit after the company raised its guidance, but that wasn't enough for the street. For the quarter though, the numbers were pretty strong sales, jumping at 24% to 13.5 billion. That's a new record for the company, CEO Steven Squarie, saying that the upbeat that he was still upbeat on the consumer, traveled, demand, exceeding expectations. Customers are not changing spending behavior at least for now. One thing I do want to note though, profits were up only 3% during the quarter, Jared. A lot of that has to do with the fact that American Express set aside more than $700 million in anticipation of a tougher macro economic environment. You're looking at a year to date. It shares off just around 15%. Compare that to the broader market. American Express is actually doing pretty well. So no signs yet, Jared, that the consumer is pulling back. You've got to question though what these numbers could potentially look like for the current quarter and then of course maybe for the early quarters of 2023. Yes. And American Express wasn't the only one that was increasing their loan loss reserves. Let's go to the Wi-Fi Interactive. I'm going to do a quick charting on this. We just showed a year to date. This is a one year and we are indeed by some critical levels here. But let me just put a 20 year chart. Oopsies, let's try to get that 20 year chart up one more time as I fat finger this tiny little tablet. All right, here we go. Now, see what we're looking at here. Everybody focus on that, Shana. There we go. All right, so we got a series of consolidations and breaks to new highs. But this is like a textbook upward trend here. It's just taking place over a very, very long period of time. And the current lows are actually the prior highs and so all is well in the universe here. Now let me shift attention to the NASDAQ 100 from the Dow. And this is over the last five days. Netflix here is the leader. If we sort by equal weight, you can see up in the upper left Netflix up 25% for the week. And here is a 20 year chart. Now this looks a little bit different. It had been in a nice uptrend and severely broke that. That's what happens with some of these growth stocks. But I just want to show you on a two year basis what's that's looking, what that is looking like. Now, we know the news this week, Netflix has somewhat improved their response to subscriber losses. And it seems like they have that on track right now. Lots of hope with their reengineering strategy also pushing to increase the revenues through that ad supported service and also to monetize the free loaders, aka me. So we'll see how that works out, guys. You are full of surprises today, brother. Oopsies, you haven't yet that. Netflix is really interesting. Obviously, the story moving forward is the ad tier and the password sharing. But in terms of the actual content, I think it's interesting because they have this sequel to Knives Outcoming. And I always forget the name is called Glass Onion. And while the theaters want them to do more of that, this is limited. One week, 600 theaters. And on the other hand, they've seen Dumber 10th most stream show of all time. It's not bad. So you can't help but wonder which direction they'll take in terms of content moving forward. I think the Dumber type model seems to favor them a lot more, find these franchises that put up these massive numbers. Yeah, it certainly does. And it also, I think it's just big as a question just in terms of what that subscriber growth is going to look...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,79,2022-10-21 19:37:41
3896," seems to favor them a lot more, find these franchises to put up these massive numbers. Yeah, it certainly does. And I think it's just big as a question, just in terms of what that subscriber growth is going to look like. Like, yes, we got a very, very strong number for the third quarter. I think the ad tier is going to boost numbers at least in the short term. But how many of those subscribers are going to potentially downgrade? I know you and I have talked about that many times. And how many new subscribers are really going to be able to pull in? Because, yes, it's cheaper than what the entry, what the base price is now. But it's still a lot. And people already are subscribed to so many different services that you've got a question where that saturation number is. It will be an interesting story ahead. My play is Hawaiian Airlines, who Amazon is now hired to fly the first Airbus cargo planes in the retail giant's air network. Hawaiian will fly at least 10 Airbus A330-300 converted freighters for Amazon starting in the fall of 2023. Now, the Airbus Jets will be the largest in Amazon's fleet. And we'll replace older aircraft. Amazon currently outsources to Atlas worldwide holdings, ATSG and Sun Country, which fly mainly Boeing jets. Under the agreement, Hawaiian is issuing words for Amazon to acquire up to 15% of its stock. Exercise will over the next nine years. Hawaiian will also hire pilots and additional mechanics as well. Hawaiian stock up more than 10% on this news. But still down, more than 18% year to date, Amazon's up also more than 3%. After a string of strong airlines earnings, Hawaiian will report on Tuesday. One interesting thing we've seen from Amazon, from American to Delta to United Jared is every CEO is talked about the new Norman travel, which is people combining business with pleasure travel, all three of them seeing it wildly. It should be interesting to see if that's a new norm or just a minor reflection of remote work. I really want to jump in on this bandwagon. So no to my superiors here, I am down to fly to wherever, as long as it is a coastal destination with good weather right now. And work. And work, yeah, yeah, work related obviously. Work. It's a great, I don't even know how to follow up with that. You're really throwing them out there. I like it a lot. But let's say I'd back to Hawaiian and what we could hear next week, because there was an interesting note out from Deutsche Bank on the heels of this announcement saying that Amazon's business will not only improve Hawaiians and revenue diversification, but it's also going to help alleviate the earnings volatility that we tend to see when it comes to Hawaiians business. So Deutsche Bank saying it's very positive. You mentioned the fact that they are negative year to date. We'll take a, I guess get a better look at those numbers next week. Great. As we head to break, let's take a look at the rally that we're seeing play out, accelerating into the close. You can see the down year, the highs of the day, up 757 points. S&P up nearly two and a half percent. The NASDAQ also hanging onto gains up just around a 2%. Not next, a TikTok under fire following a report on how the company wanted to use location data. We've got the details on that when we come back. $133 million.��",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,80,2022-10-21 19:42:07
3897," Epic music The US-China trade war thought to have simmered a bit following the Trump administration's tariffs escalating to a whole new level the US ban on advanced chip exports. Senior columnist Rick Newman and presidential candidate in 2024 joining us now. No, Rick, you're not running? You've declared, right? Tax breaks for our news anchors. That's my whole platform. That's your platform. So, tell us about the escalation here. These are new rules that the Biden administration announced two weeks ago with almost no fanfare. If you remember back, everything about the Trump tariffs on China went through a megaphone where Trump was talking about it on Twitter, on all of his interviews and everybody had to figure out if he's really going to go through on this thread or not go all the distance. What Biden has done seems to be far more significant with far less fanfare. In the short version this, it's very complicated, is a whole new range of what are basically embargoes on advanced semiconductor sales to China and also any technology that China might be able to use to make its own advanced semiconductor. So one analyst described this as an intent to strangle with an intent to kill China's artificial intelligence industry. And this has everything to do not just with computers and technology, but it has a lot to do with surveillance, electric vehicles, and certainly with advanced weaponry. So the Biden administration is doing something here that really seems like it is going to put a stranglehold on part of China's economy and China is probably going to retaliate in some way. So, this is going to get messier. Just real quick, how do you think they might retaliate? Because we haven't heard much about that yet, Rick. No, they haven't. So some of the things they could do would be making life hard for US businesses operating in China. There are many American businesses that want to sell to the Chinese market and do so to the Chinese market. And you think about Tesla and Apple, for example. They could also restrict sales to the United States of things like rare earth minerals. There are some such minerals, really important to technologies of the future that China has kind of has a corner on the market. So they could do that or they could do subtler things. And they can also file a complaint at the World Trade Organization, which would take years and years to resolve as is usually the case. So this is going to be very interesting for a long time to come. And Rick, speaking of the rising escalating tensions here between the US and China, the Chinese from behind TikTok has now denying some allegations that we heard published initially in Forbes that it was using the social media app to track American users. You would think that this would attract even more scrutiny from Washington, then. And I think it is attracting scrutiny from Washington behind the scenes. This is kind of a weird dance, if you will, between bite dance, TikTok's parent company in Forbes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,81,2022-10-21 19:46:18
3898," And then. And I think it is attracting scrutiny from Washington behind the scenes. This is what this is kind of a weird dance, if you will, between bite dance, tick tock parent company and Forbes. So Forbes published a piece recently. Saying that the parent company of tick tock based in China had a plan to monitor or track a what sounds like a small number of us individuals and they did not identify who they were now they said they had a plan to track these people and we don't know if it was just randos using tick tock or if they were going to track like Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden on tick tock now what bite dance has come out and said is no we did not track anybody. And we don't track anybody on tick tock any us users on tick tock so Forbes said they had a plan to do it but actually putting it into effect and bite dance came out and said no we never track anybody any American users on tick tock so what's really going on here. But look, I mean, we should all know at this point every social media company sucks up every bit of data. It can get about you, including one space here in the United States. And now there are many millions of people whose data is on a social media app that is controlled by a company in China. Yeah. Is that cool with everybody? You know, it seems to be it seems like a lot of the users simply don't care, which is also part of the issue here, but I'm sure we will this is not the last event. We will continue to hear more about this Rick Newman. As always, thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Bye. All right. Doctors across the US reporting a rise in pediatric respiratory viruses well before the typical winter cold and flu season Yahoo finances. And we're already seeing the number of cases overwhelm some hospitals. That's right. And this is something that experts had been warning about. We've seen that respiratory viruses have been absent from the pressure that health health systems face in the last few years because of COVID. And so what typically happens is that these respiratory viruses come with one rising and the other falling by comparison to each other. But what we're finding right now is a health systems are preparing for three different outbreaks at the same time in the same season. That includes COVID in flu and RSV RSV is an interesting one because it really impacts the most vulnerable and impacts kids and also impacts elderly adults. We've seen 2.1 million cases typically a year. And you see each year RSV leads to on average 58,000 hospitalizations with about 100 to 500 deaths among kids younger than five. So that's where the concern is and that's why children's hospitals especially are overwhelmed. We also know that that's the same age group that has the lowest COVID vaccination rate. So as you can imagine really, really tough times for these health systems right now not surprising health experts have been warning about this in the in previous months and we're trying to see an early aggressive flu season as well. We just spoke to the lab course CEO Adam Schecter about one test that can test for all three COVID and the flu as well. And vaccine companies are working on combo vaccine for for the same reason. Yep. So the rise and respiratory illness shortage of a mox is still in reportedly what are we learning. So we know that this is largely affecting certain CVS locations in the country. It's not a widespread shortage just yet. The company is working with the manufacturer or manufacturers right now. No more details on that. It's important to note that this is something that's been sort of hopscotting around the globe. We've heard reports of shortages on and off throughout the year in different countries as well. From some from various manufacturers and done clear right now what really is causing that but we know we do know that CVS is on track to resume this and it shouldn't be a widespread issue. I'm Julie Kimmelani. Thanks so much for those details coming up next the new business or big business. I should say a Taylor Swift a number of companies are teaming up with her to promote her midnight's album. Well the details after the break. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,82,2022-10-21 19:50:30
3899," MUSIC Taylor Swift and her fans as Swifties have taken over Twitter amid the release of her new album Midnight Yahoo! The album was released at Midnight and according to Downic Detector, nearly 8,000 reports of outages on the Spotify platform as a direct result of the album's release. And if we're talking about Taylor Swift, I know into the break you call her a big business, and she certainly is. From a marketing perspective, the buzz leading up to this album has been very astonishing. Taylor has released TikTok videos, Instagram posts. She released a teaser video during Amazon's Thursday night football game last night, obviously a huge platform there, and she's seen a significant amount of engagement through all of those tactics. And on Twitter, the company released a whole report on Taylor Swift's popularity. Some nuggets from that report you're seeing on your screen, 329 million tweets mentioning Taylor Swift in the last 12 years that fan base name Swifties tweeted over 18 million times since 2010. And so much more, I spoke with Brand expert Sunny Bono. He'll told me that Taylor has used a variety of strategies to increase the momentum surrounding each of her respective releases. We know she's constantly reinventing herself, her music, her look, and that reinvention has really been key to her success. And then finally, one thing that I want to call out is that on Twitter, I notice that a lot of these consumer facing brands, inions, Amtrak, LinkedIn, even do a lingo, they've all tweeted about the midnight's album over the past 24 hours, 12 hours. So they're really capitalizing on Taylor Swift. And that just goes to show the impact that she's had. So at the end of the day, it's just, you know, Taylor's world, we're all just living in it. No doubt, man, she is an absolute machine. Switching gears to the box office, Ally, two releases expected to dominate this weekend.

3900," and she is an absolute machine. Switching years to the box office, Ally, two releases expected to dominate this weekend. One is a DC comic book, black Adam, the other, a romcom, which we haven't seen a lot in the theaters recently. Ticket to Paradise, what's the expectation? Yeah, and I want to start with that, that romcom, because I love a good underdog story. Ticket to Paradise, it's already secure nearly a 75 million internationally, a very successful start, and it does take the pressure off of that domestic debut currently expectations are set in the low to mid teens. It will have to battle the rocks black Adam. That's expected to secure around 6 million plus. So ticket to Paradise could be more of a slow burn, but it does call into question the future of the romcom, according to one analyst that I spoke with, this could symbolize a resurgence of the romcom, especially after the success of the lost city back in March. But we'll have to see how it does. And Ally, I know we're a few weeks away from the black panthers. The sequel here will condo, but the bar has been set so, so high for this film. What are the expectations? Yeah, it's crazy that we already have expectations for this, but early tracking by NRG shows that the sequel could debut to 175 million. Now, if that number holds, it would be the second biggest debut this year, right behind another big Marvel sequel, Dr. Strange in the multiverse of madness. And for a little context there, the original black panther opened to 202 million in 2018. So still a possibility that that number could come in even higher. And we've seen advanced ticket sales been really strong. It won't have that much competition. And of course, it's going to debut right before the holidays. So potentially some more momentum carrying it through the end of the year. But November 11th, that's the magic date that we'll finally see this movie come to theaters. Very much looking forward to that one. Ally, can I now thank you? Enjoy the weekend, my friend. Thanks. You too. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stay with us here on Yandong Finance Law.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,84,2022-10-21 19:59:36
3901," All right, just a couple of minutes away from the closing bell. Let's bring in Yahoo! Fanat's is Jared Blyckery to see if we can finally have ourselves a positive Friday, my friend. Finally, eight out of the last nine have been negative. But look at this. To close the week, we have the Dow, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, each up over 2% throwing the Russell 2000 there with it. The S&P 500 is deck up over 5% down there almost with it and S&P 500 about in the same place. Here is, I think this is going to be the sector action for the week. In fact, the entire week, all five days, energy in the lead followed by tech materials, consumer discretionary, all of those the outperformers and what a day for the Fed. I mean, we woke up to a Nick Timmerl's article, then we had a intervention, then we had some Mary daily comments as well, throwing all of it. And guess what? By the end of the day, by the end of the week, we're seeing a lot of the money flow into some of these fringe markets like meme stocks. So I'm going to go through some of these rather quickly. Here's the Nasdaq also on a five day basis, Amazon, tacking on gains 11% there and video also up 11%. Tesla, having a little bit of a rough go after its earnings, but still managing to cap the week at 4.5% Microsoft alphabet right there with it. Let me just show you some of our heatmaps here for the week. Travel looking pretty good. Carnival cruise lines up 15% United Airlines, the airlines announcing. That's up 14% bank stocks doing fairly well after rounding out the big bank earnings. Earlier this week, you can see JP Morgan Bank of America each up about 10%. Goldman Sachs up 8% with 15 seconds to go. We're going to check in on the EB market. And here we go. I took a Tesla, but look at Ford. That's up 4.5% and GM up 6%. This ending the day well in the green as we wrap up the trading week. Dow, Nasdaq and S&P all up over 2% today. Some of that rally coming in in the final hour and a half of trading. To look at the sector action, all 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the upside for the day materials by far the outperform up just around 3.5%. Energy consumer discretionary financials not too far behind. Right from on, this will bring in Jordan, Pence, Pence, Capitol, management, cheap investment officer. We also have Alfred Eskindar. He's a self financial president and chief operating officer. Dryden, let me start with you. We're certainly are looking at a day of solid gains all through the major averages up to well over 2% today. What's your takeaway not only from the buying we saw today, but really what we've seen play out over the entire trading week? Well, I think everyone's looking for that idea about pause. And whenever you have anything from the Fed speak that possibly there's a pause and raising the interest rate cycle. I think you're going to see a kind of a hyperactive response because everybody's been the frazzled cat for the last couple of months. So things have been a little too negative when every bad news comes out and then sometimes we get a little overreactive on the positive side. So anytime you get something about the Fed's possibly going to pause, then you're going to see this massive reaction. Sometimes it can be an overreaction as well. And that's the question, isn't it Alfred? Because San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, you have to really seek out the dovish comment and she said the time is now to start talking about stepping down. The time is now to start planning for stepping down, but she was clear, this ain't it. Are we overreacting? Are the markets rather? I don't think it's so much of an overreaction as a release. We've had volatility spiking all year. I mean, if you think about where volatility began and January where we are, it's up 73%. So think about the rocky road that investors have to deal with. You couple that with obviously the moves and the Fed inflation and everyone feeling the pinch at home. And then you get a psychology really coming into play with the average investor. So when you have huge down weeks like we've had in the last couple, a week like today is fantastic. It feels great to be up almost 5% on all the major indices for the week. But that is not a respite for the all clear sign. What we have to understand is the rest of the year is going to look pretty much like this. We're going to have massive weeks up and massive weeks down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,85,2022-10-21 20:03:30
3902," the all clear side. What we have to understand is the rest of the year is going to look pretty much like this. We're going to have massive weeks up and massive weeks down. And you know, it is not for the investor with a soft stomach. Jordan, what do you think these happen in order for there to be some more conviction in the market and for you to be more bullish? Well, I think there's three big terms out there. We're looking for peace in the Ukraine. We're looking for a pause. We're looking for verification of the peak and interest rates. And so far, a core has not peaked yet. And we don't we're not going to really get until the middle of next month. If you're after this next Fed move, the next read on on inflation. And that's going to probably not be a pretty read. If you it has a core hasn't peaked yet, we think. And so I think you have to get past where we have this moment of assurance that we probably have hit peak both core and headline. And that we are actually legitimately talking about a pause in the rise in the federal fund rates. I don't think a pivot is probably something to be afraid of because I think if they pivot, they've broken it. But if they move to a pause and extended pause period of time to let because consumers have to catch up. We can trade policy. You can change policy overnight or within a day or markets will check in a day. But consumers, the drivers of inflation have to catch up. It takes six or eight months. And I think that we're forgetting that. So for me to be bullish again, we have to begin to see that policy makers are beginning to give the consumers some time for reality to catch up with what they're trying to do. A lot of peas in there. So Alfred, when do we see that pause? And when do we get an indication that inflation is beginning to at least peak? Well, you know, the numbers are going to guide us and and certainly the federal respond accordingly. But in lieu of all that, I think investors really need to take a look at the portfolios and understand the risk exposure and depending on who you are. You know, if you're a young investor, guess what? You've got time. You could actually write out, you know, this volatility, you know, for the next few quarters. However, if you're a little bit older, thankfully, there are plenty of products that have been introduced in the last 10, 15 years that are quite sophisticated that are really terrific defensive products to use when markets are this volatile. You know, if you're 55 and you're thinking about retirement, seeing a 20% draw down the S&P 30 and that's like, that's not what you want to experience. So there's plenty of products out there. Think about the risk in your portfolio and be defensive. Like, you know, winning is also akin to not losing. So the less you lose, the more you win in markets like this. And I think taking a much more defensive posture for those who have been in the market for quite a bit is the right thing to do. It's the prudent thing to do right now. Can you give some of those older investors some of those products? Sure. Well, listen, anything from, you know, fixed index annuities, structured products and then on the super accessible, easy thing are buffer ETFs. Now granted, they're not going to protect you for the total downside that we've seen this year in the markets. But, you know, being down 10% versus being down 25 is still a win. So again, defensive sectors, defensive products products that actually can give the investor downside protection to some extent or completely are some things that should be added to a portfolio. It's not just about stocks and certainly bonds have been down this year as well. So we got to think about the portfolio a lot differently. The 6040 is kind of updated. Jordan, what do you think? And I guess where are you seeing the most opportunity today in terms of what investors should be doing? Well, one thing we have now that we have not had in years is we have an interest rate. And so for some investors, actually, it's appropriate right now. The two years is actually yielding pretty good. And so if they think about long term, we're going to have rights go down. Now's a good time to think about sometime between now and the end of the year, maybe adding some to your treasury to the portfolios because now you can, you know, if you're trying to get eight long term and compound that, well, you know, all four to quarter, get you halfway there. And so, but the other side of it is when we think about looking at who's going to do well in a continued inflationary environment. And we actually see that barbellying things make some sense to the consumer. You have companies like Walmart and some of the ones who are helping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,86,2022-10-21 20:07:50
3903," than a continued inflationary environment. And we actually see that barbellying things make some sense to the consumer. You have companies like Walmart and some of the ones who are helping the low end consumer, you have people who are making over $80,000 a year. Now moving down to that market, so you're gonna see continued growth there. And actually, wages have grown faster than inflation. So you see wages growing faster than inflation for people at the lower end of the economic spectrum. At the higher end of the economic spectrum, their incomes are rising as fast as inflation. And so it's kind of this barbell between LVMH, luxury goods and Walmart. But it's the people in the middle that are gonna continue to have problems as we get into 2023. Maybe we have a small recession. They're gonna be hurt the most. And so you kind of break it up when you think of equity, you think of barbellying those two ends of the consumer. And I think in the center, you're gonna have some challenges for the maces, the targets and those guys because their customers are gonna move to either side. LVMH Walmart barbell is a fascinating one, Jordan, thank you. Appreciate you coming out in the studio. Alfred, you come see us next time. Both of you guys have a good weekend. Appreciate it.

3904," just take a look at what it looks like right now. Here's a picture from Marine Exchange. They are an organization that tracks the backlog at the LA County ports. You can tell in this picture, really clear waters, not much backlog there. As of yesterday, five container ships are backed up at the LA County ports. So that's a big drop from what we saw, the 109 cargo ships that were backlogged in the LA County ports. But the reason goes back to many of these shipping companies, retailers have been shifting and sending their goods to other ports like Georgia, Savannah, Georgia, Houston, Texas, New York. And so to really cushion themselves against the supply chain snarls that they dealt with during the pandemic, when they sent all their goods to the LA County ports. But another reason for why we're seeing such a big drastic decline in these backlogs goes back to cargo volume. Cargo container volume has actually decreased about 11%. So you're really seeing this shift in dynamics, but the backlogs still remain as there is excess inventory that retailers are dealing with. Certainly something that we will continue to watch right now. Thanks so much. Cargo volume, meanwhile a mess on the Mississippi. How vital is the Mississippi River for US commerce? Well, between 2015 and 2019, 95% of corn, 94% of soybeans, and 45% of wheat moved by barge through the Mississippi River. Now we have dangerously low water levels threatening the flow of grain exports. Peter Friedman is the executive director of the Agricultural Transportation Coalition. Good to see you, sir. I want to dive into the economics in a moment. But how do you characterize these dangerously low water levels in the situation you're seeing? It's having a devastating impact on the flow of some of our major agricultural commodities, both impacting the domestic market, but also impacting our ability in our country to be a good, dependable supplier to the world of these agricultural commodities. Yeah, Peter, talk a little bit more about the economic implications of this because like Dave said, half of US grain exports traveled down to the Mississippi when you see an issue like this. What does this potentially do to prices? Well, it'll increase the prices. Look at the difficulty here. Unlike the international ocean containerized cargo, these are bulk commodities. They travel north, south from the northern part of the Midwest down to the Mississippi River, the mouth of the Mississippi River, to bulk ships that carry corn and soybeans, grains, in bulk, huge commodity volumes all over the world. And those are products that are dependent upon by the rest of the world. And in many cases, they can substitute the sourcing from other countries, but in most cases, they cannot substitute. They cannot find these volumes elsewhere. So what happens is the pricing goes up because you're not only buying grain or soybeans from the United States, you're buying grain and soybeans delivered to the place you need them in Africa, South America, and Asia, and so forth. So the delivery cost is skyrocketing because you can't get the product down the river. And the difficulty is that unlike these containerized cargoes that go are the east coast or the west coast, and you can move around. There is no alternative, no realistic alternative, to the barge movement of these massive volumes of commodities. I can give you an example. One barge, just one barge, is holds the equivalent of cargo of 138 trucks. We're talking about the biggest semi-trucks that you see on the highways. One barge, 138 of those trucks. And typically, the barges go in four barge toes, they're called four toes, four barges. That's 550.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,88,2022-10-21 20:16:25
3905," Typically, the barges go in four barged toes, they're called toes, four barges. That's 550 huge trucks. And you see there are thousands of these barges that are on the sand sitting on the bottom, not moving. So that's thousands of barges. We do not have hundreds of thousands of extra trucks sitting around, or hundreds of thousands of extra truck drivers sitting around able to carry that cargo. So it's going that there until we get some rain. Those pictures are just stunning. Is it as simple as a lack of precipitation? And what can be done? Well, first of all, it has to be recognized. Some people would say that, well, if it doesn't go in barge, can it go by rail? Because rail can also carry large volumes. Difficulty is that the barges and our river system go north to south. And most of our railroads go east and west. So there is not a simple replacement of rail for barge. The situation is really dependent upon, as you show here, precipitation. And what we have with agriculture is you certainly have farmers who know that while people living in cities, sometimes we think we're insulated from mother nature. We're not. Farmers know it. This happens. And we need rain to fill the river and get the depth we need to move those barges. And Peter, you need a lot of rain in order to fill that river. Any assymage, and how long this problem could potentially last? There are some people saying that it could be three weeks. But again, it's mother nature. And predicting that is a profession, I guess, but it's not a science. So we're thinking three weeks. There will be some areas that will fill faster. One of the kind of interim solutions is that you load the barges with less grain, less soybean, less corn. And so they'll be lighter and they can float on less water. And I think that's what we're going to be seeing first. Again, that dramatically increases the cost of transportation by moving less cargo with each barge movement. The other thing that's happening is that there are huge storage facilities being developed. And you just got to place the stuff on the ground. Corn can handle storage on the ground. Soybeans are more delicate. So we're going to be seeing and expecting some damage for that cargo. And when you ship damage goods, you get less money for them. So that's another downstream expectation, even once the water fills these rivers. And massive, massive economic implications here. Peter Freeman, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for having me. Thanks for coming up. Coming up as soon, you'll be able to squirrel away even more money for retirement. And you have inflation to thank for it. We'll break down the new retirement contribution limits after the break. Be sure to continue to16 disrupt the rest of the revolution.

3906,"........ All right. Me too. Yeah. So nice. You're doing great. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The pandemic's 7.5 million student loan bar was in default in April. The Education Department announced an initiative to get default bar wars in good standing through its fresh start program. The financial crisis is running with more details on this. How is the fresh start program different from what was previously available to bar wars? Previously, bar wars had to have at least 9 on time payments before they could get out of default status. Due to the pandemic and the forbearance pause, those payments of 0 will count towards that 9. It's useful for people who are like, you know, they've been struggling. They couldn't do it. So now you can use those payments to do it. Also, the forbearance, the fresh start program allows people to restore their eligibility for student student aid. And it removes default from the credit history and also the credit alert system for mortgage lenders. It's important to point out that it's not just students who are able to apply for this relief. Many parents who supported those students throughout college are also eligible. What can you tell us about that? So separate from the fresh start program for default borrowers. The Biden student loan for giving this program is available for anybody that has federal student loans. So what we've been seeing, what representative Ayanna Presley and AOC have been talking about, has been parents and grandparents who've been burdened by not only the parent plus loans as they've taken out for their children and grandchildren. But also, they're still carrying their own debt. Many of them couldn't retire. So if they have debt that they still have from their federal student loan, they can apply. If their children took out federal student loans, they can apply. If they took out parent plus loans, they are also eligible for relief. All right, round of the important information there. Thanks so much for filling us in. All right, it's time to review your Medicare benefits beneficiaries. Have until December 7th to make some potentially money saving decision. Joghub Finance is carrying in and joins us now with the details and carry tells. What do we need to know? Oh, yeah, this is now this is good news. One year and I want to start quickly with some good savings coming up for Medicare beneficiaries in the in 2023. The premiums and the deductibles for Medicare part B are coming down, which is excellent news. The co shares on vaccines are going away and the insulin cap is going to come into effect starting at about $35 a month. So this is great news. So good savings ahead. But this is open enrollment season. So what that means is you have until as you mentioned, December 7th to really take a look. If you have a Medicare Advantage program or a part D prescription plan, this is your time to really look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,90,2022-10-21 20:25:17
3907," December 7th to really take a look. If you have a Medicare Advantage program or a Part D prescription plan, this is your time to really look hard back to the matter. Seven out of 10 people, Kaiser Family Foundation has found don't actually do this, but they're big savings to be had. And here's why every year, every year changes are constantly going on. You'll get a notice you've already had it from your plan provider, which is called the annual notice of change. And it's things like what pharmacies you can go to your deductibles, all of that stuff comes in the out of pocket minimums, all kinds of things get shifted around every single year. And you can find big savings. I mean, even if your pharmacy is no longer in the network, you could end up saving thousands of dollars by simply moving to a pharmacy that is now in your network, but you might not even realize that if you don't do your homework. So it's really important to really pay attention to these changes because it's the time Medicare Advantage plan, there's a lot of great ones out there, but it's important to really know what is changing year to year and where you can get the biggest bang. Indeed, and Carrie, Dave, if people have questions about their options or how to sign up, what should they do? Where they go? Oh, I'm so glad you asked that. You know, interestingly enough, Medicare has one of the best ways to help you do this comparison shopping. They have something called the plan finder right on the website medicare.gov. Check it out because it's everything. It's not just if you go to your insurer. This is actually giving you everything in your area and yet very helpful. They also, you can just call Medicare. They're excellent about getting on the phone with you and helping you out. Medicare Rights Center is also a terrific resource to help you hold your hand a little bit walk you through it. Trust me, this is a head scratcher for a lot of people very confusing, but there's help out there. The other one I really like is the state health insurance assistance programs. It's called ship help dot org. And if you go to ship help dot org, there's free volunteers. It's a free service volunteers all over the country are there to really help you walk you through this comparison shopping and it doesn't have to be super hard. I mean, someone I was interviewing for this story said to me, hey, you know, if you can shop on Amazon, you can really use Medicare's plan finder. It's not that hard. So it's really worth doing. Even I can figure that out. Carry hand and good to see you. Thanks so much. Enjoy the weekend. Alright, high inflation means there are big updates to retirement savings plan contributions. The IRS announcing a record increase in contribution limits to certain retirement plans. Here are the numbers you need to know. Starting next year, you'll be allowed to contribute up to 22,500 into your 401k for 3B. Most 457 plans or the thrift savings plan for federal employees. That's $2,000 more than the current limit of 20,500 for participants who are 50 or older. The catch up contribution for 401ks and other workplace plans will increase by $1,000 to $7,500. That means if you're over 50, you can contribute as much as $30,000 to your 401k next year. Let's move to individual retirement accounts or IRAs IRA contributions will raise increase $6,500 for 2023 of $500 increase. However, the catch up contribution limit stays unchanged at $1,000. In addition, the IRS announced updates to contributions to individual 401ks and income limits for Roth IRAs. All this just one more way inflation is impacting your wallet. Alright, coming up, factors ranging from rising inflation to the feds rate tightening have dragged the major indices lower this year, but find out what's really hurting the economy. Next.

3908,"eti Let's take a look at some of the biggest movers of the week. First off, snap. Now, it moved on the heels of its earnings report. The company posted a further slowdown in sales in its most recent quarter. And it also signaled no growth here going forward when you take a look at snapshairs. Closing the week well in the red, the five day chart there. You can see it off just around 22%. It's the latest sign that advertisers are still cutting back on spending. The disappointing result, dragging some competitors lower today. Meta and Pinterest, both of those stocks, ending the day in the red. You can see Meta off just over 1% Pinterest on the other hand, off a 6.5%. Another big mover of the week is Tesla. Now shares Sank after the company missed on third quarter revenue. And warn that deliveries may fall just short of that 50% annual growth target. Despite that miss, CEO Elon Musk, he of course, remained upbeat on the earnings called telling analysts that Tesla remains, quote, pedal to the metal even as a potential recession. Looms, shares fell about 6% on Thursday. But taking a look at the week to date chart, you can see it up still in the green. Up just around 4.6% selling the week at 2.1444 a share. Now it's rounded out with Netflix. The stock also moving on earnings. But this time, a surprise beat on subscriber growth, ascending the stock's soaring. Now share sword about 13% earlier this week. It's been a top performer in the S&P this coming after the gain of 2.4 million new users during the third quarter. More than double what they had just projected a quarter ago. The streaming giant also giving details on how a plan said crack down on password sharing. Take a look at this five day chart. You can see the shares up 25% selling the week at 289. A 57 on your day basis though, still well in the red with shares off just over 50%. Dave. Great stuff. Shauna, thank you. Here's what we're washing in a very busy earnings period next week. Monday, I want to be quiet on that front. We'll get a glimpse at U.S. manufacturing services PMI. Tuesday, there is where the phone begins with earnings from Coca-Cola, UPS, GM, GE, Jet Blue, Twitter, Alphabet and Chipotle. We'll also get the K-Shiller home price.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,92,2022-10-21 20:34:21
3909," The fun begins with earnings from Coca-Cola, UPS, GM, GE, JetBlue, Twitter, alphabet, and Chipotle. We'll also get the K-Shiller home price index as well as consumer confidence. Wednesday, earnings from Boeing, Hilton, Metta, Kraft Hines, and Ford as well as new home sales. Thursday, the fun continues. Probably the big one. Apple and Amazon report. So too, will MasterCard McDonald, Southwest Airlines, Merck, Intel, and Caterpillar would get a really good glimpse at the state of the economy on that day. Economic data, including GDP, initial jobless claims, and durable goods orders. And Friday, it's all energy. Exxon and Chevron report earnings. We'll also see Core PCE, University of Michigan, Consumer Sentiment, Index, and pending home sales of very busy week in the economy, Yahoo Finance, all over it. All right, we'll make space on your shelf, a new book out, now called Win Women Lead, what they achieve, why they succeed, how we can learn from them details, the stories of more than 60 female executives and their experiences leading companies. The book's author, Julia Borson, is here along with Yahoo Finance, editor in chief, Andy Sirward. Julia, it's great to have you. Congratulations on the new book, was going through some stats that you said over just 8% of Fortune 500 CEOs, our women drawing in less than 3% of all VC dollars. I know you've talked with people, everyone from Gwen with Palchro, Dijon, Hyman, at Rent the Runway to Smaller Business Owners, but tell us just what you learned about the key characteristics from those women who do in fact succeed. Yes, those women succeed despite the odds. And I was always so curious, how did these women manage not only to grow and scale game-changing companies, but to do so with such little access to capital compared to their male counterparts. And what I found is that women lead in very different ways than the traditional archetypal male leadership. They're more likely to lead with empathy, a communal approach to management. So bringing in perspectives from across an organization rather than just top-down management, and women are more likely to lead with things like vulnerability or gratitude, characteristics which are not traditionally associated with leadership, but in fact can be leadership superpowers. Julia, Andy here, how are you doing? So good to see you, Andy. Good to see you too. I have a question. So there have been a number of books about women and empowerment and leadership, and how do you think you're moving the conversation forward? Well, so, Andy, there are so many books that tell women what to do to succeed. They say, lean in. Here's the confidence code. Here's how to act, but there are very few books that really summarize and share all these amazing examples and stories. And I think what's really necessary is, as a journalist, for me to show, not tell. You are my boss and mentor many years ago, Andy, and you always said, show, don't tell. I think it's really important for women to see these amazing examples and to see these leadership traits in action. So what I do is I tell the stories of dozens of game-changing, odd-stifying leaders, and then I use the research and data to explain what it is they're doing. Okay, here she's leading with something called servant leadership. Servant leadership is an approach that's taken by Howard Schultz, who founded Starbucks, but is something women are more likely to do, and here's why it's effective if done by both men and women. And Julia, what was kind of the most surprising interview that you did or something that just really blew your mind the most? Oh, there were so many interesting stories in here and so many inspiring stories. I can't tell you the number of times in an interview with one of these founders, Brahmit of Tears, because the grit and resilience encourage of these women to defy the odds was so remarkable. But I think sometimes the stories are most surprising are the ones that are right in front of your nose. So how say Whitney Wolfherd? You may have remembered that she was that tender before she founded Bumble, but what was really driving her to try to switch the way online dating works and put women in charge or the fact that Bwyneth Paltrow, she leads with vulnerability. She's maybe one of the biggest movie stars in the world, but she decided to admit what she didn't know and she had to ask for the CEO role of the company that she started herself. So had to put herself in a position of vulnerability to do that. So I think looking at the surprising unexpected angles of characters that you may have seen out in the news, really finding those news stories will surprise you. Julia Bourston, congratulations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,93,2022-10-21 20:38:15
3910," is surprising unexpected angles of characters that you may have seen out in the news, really finding those new stories will surprise you. Well, Julia Borsden, congratulations on your new book, author of When Women Lead. Congratulations, we wish you all the best. Thank you. Andy, before we let you go, we want to talk about the column that you just wrote. And you looked into, why ever sessions happen, what causes inflation, what causes economic downturns? And I know a lot of it comes down to supply and demand. What can you tell us? Yeah, well, I mean, it really does come down to that, Shawna, and there's either too much demand or not enough supply. And one of those two things causes prices to rise, economic downturn and a recession. I mean, the typical demand shock would be, say, a stock market crash or 2008, the housing crash, where people didn't have enough money, a lack of demand. A supply shock would be, say, the oil in bargos in the 1970s when there was not enough oil in that tank, the economy. So what do we have here? Well, we have both. And I think it's fair to say that, certainly not in my lifetime, where I have ever seen a case where we got such great imbalances, because you have both huge demand brought about by government stimulus in the United States, where people were buying cars and homes and meme stocks, right? And then the supply problems, which you know about, which are oil, not enough employees, not enough semiconductors. So you put those things together, very complicated. We definitely have both a supply and demand problem right now, which is very vexing for J-PAL for Liz Trusts, right? Leaders having a hard time figuring this out, you guys. Liz Trust, didn't outlive the lettuce. No, it wasn't. What about supply side constraints? We're not all that familiar with. Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of them. I mean, some of these things are pretty obvious. Like COVID, of course, has caused supply constraints, because number one, of course, it's constricting. The number of people going to work still. And also in China, very much constricting manufacturing there. Ukraine, of course, constricting supply of food, green oil, fertilizer, and those kinds of things. But also you've got things like climate change, which we can get into a little bit. Like for instance, right now, there's going to be a shortage, you guys, of cranberries and prices going up because massive droughts in Massachusetts and the economists are saying, that's because of climate change now, one season. I don't know. I'm not going to get into that. I'm not going down that rabbit hole. But here's another one, for instance. I talked to a guy who runs a waste management company, right? And he said he needs permitting all the time, right? For his business. And he said, because of the great resignation, key personnel in local municipalities, state government, provinces in Canada, federal government, they're not filling these things. It's not because of budget things. It's just there are no people there, so he can't get permits, right? So that's another type of supply constraint. There's just not enough people around to do these kinds of jobs. And Andy, of course, the question that everyone is trying to figure out the answer to is, how do you address the supply shocks and the problems that we're seeing play out in the economy? Well, it's interesting you ask, because the traditional tools of the Fed uses, which is higher rates in the balance sheet, that affects and impacts demand. It doesn't do anything about supply. OK, so some of the things you can do for supply are to reduce tariffs, right? So we need trade flowing around the world. Remember, we also have a trade war with China right now. You guys have been talking about that this afternoon, right? Yeah. And there are other things you can do. For instance, providing relief to debt-ridden nations right now. Other things to do is make sure that the problems of Ukraine aren't hurting Europe. So in other words, providing as much oil and gas as you can to Europe. So there's a number of things like that. And then longer term, climate change people are saying, you know, moving away from oil and gas helps because it's more decentralized, right? So it's not even, it's not the climate change per se. It's just that to get oil, you know, there are certain nations have it, others that don't. So if you can have localized energy. And then supporting local businesses here, like a chip factory in the United States, providing government loans for that versus, you know, waiting for things to come from Asia. So there's, but those are longer term things. It's interesting, which is so used to like flipping a lever at the Federal Reserve for demand. But it's not going to work so well this time around. Yeah, and we're certainly seeing that play out at this time around. Andy Sauer, thanks so much. And of course, you can read Andy's column on YahooFinance.com this weekend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,94,2022-10-21 20:42:43

And of course you can read Andy's column on Yahoo Finance dot com this week. And all right, coming up next the 2022 World Cup kicks off in less than a month. Up next, one of the most well-known voices in soccer lays out what you'll expect from the tournament, including the controversy. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. And that is the sound of soccer. And in just 30 days, tens of millions of soccer fans around the world will hear that voice. This is the biggest sporting event on the planet returns nearly 3 million tickets have been sold for the Qatar World Cup and nearly 4 billion are expected to watch. Let's welcome in. The legendary Andres Cantor who I call the goal, father, Telemundo de Porteis lead broadcaster want to talk a lot about the cup but give us quickly the story of how that call came to be. Well I grew up in Argentina, they thank you for having me on and I grew up listening to the games in the radio. And radio was big and all the announcers called the goal call the same way I do and I happened to be very lucky to be in the right place at the right time and popularize the game of soccer through my goal call and especially in the 1994 World Cup. So I didn't invent anything, I just popularized it a little bit more. It is passionate and it's probably the most imitated call in all of sports. So we are focused now on the World Cup.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,95,2022-10-21 20:47:07
3912," I just, you know, popularized it a little bit more. It is passionate and it's probably the most imitated call in all of sports. So we're focused now on the World Cup. And much of the attention leading up has been on the venue, being on Qatar, being on the lack of human rights. How concerned are you about this venue? In particular, that we've switched seasons. It's not when we typically expect it. And again, that human rights factor. Obviously, you know, when we go into a major tournament, whether it be the Olympics of the World Cup, you're always worried about something happening, because obviously all eyeballs are there for a month. So obviously, I know there has been a lot of things written about human rights violations and so forth. Tel Amundo is taking the most responsible news team on site. So they will report on anything that they find factual to be reported. And I will get to call the games. Obviously, I will not live in a bubble. So if something happens during a game in the fans or with the players protesting, which I doubt FIFA will let them. But obviously, we will report it as serious as the case may be. And with all the responsibility that we have to our audience. Should human rights be considered when selecting a venue for the biggest sporting event on the planet? And should the seasonality of it? Because it's going to go head-to-head with our football versus your football. Obviously, human rights have to be taking care of on many other things when you select big sporting events like the World Cup, which is the biggest sporting event of them all. I have no doubt. We live in a very crazy world. Where do you take the next? I mean, I know it's coming home in 2026. But people from other sites of the world could point out many things that we don't do right in this country. I'm not obviously saying that. But it's obviously a consideration that major sports organizations have to take when they award the hosting rights to different countries. And in terms of the seasonality, I have to say that I love it that it's going to be played in November and December, because the players will get there with about 21 games under the belt. Usually when the World Cup is in the summer, the big stars play about 65 matches a year. So I mean, that is a lot. They get very tired legs when they have to play the World Cup. And now they will play only 21 games. So hopefully that will make for a better level of play. In this country would help certainly if the United States succeeds. It doesn't look great. They come in with the scoreless draw in the Saudis, a two-zip loss to Japan. What's their ceiling? We will see. I have to say that not only for the US, but all the other ones that are not playing great. I mean, England hasn't had a good run lately. They did not make it to the Final Four in Nation's League, neither France, neither Germany. They're not playing that well. But the World Cup is a different animal. It's seven games to get to the Final. The US has its Final on Game One, which is against Wales. If they get past Wales with three points, then they get to play England on Black Friday on the day after Thanksgiving. And if they can be England, then it's onto the next round, then. I don't know what the ceiling will be. But so I think everyone has to concentrate on the opening match more the US than anybody else. Calendar's interesting. The Final will be a week before Christmas on a Sunday. Are you feeling you live in Miami? Are you feeling soccer reach a new level here and whether that be Ted Lasso or Ryan Reynolds purchase of Rexham or the MLS or the NWSL really growing? Are you feeling? Oh, yes. Yeah. I mean, soccer keeps growing in this country. Now I have no doubt. I mean, just numbers alone. You see what the media companies are paying, what NBC paid to renew the Premier League rights, what Paramount Plus paid for four years of Champions League, $1.5 billion. MLS broke attendance records. Telemundo will break sales records for the woke up in Qatar. The ratings are there. The interest is there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJjX90THDQ,96,2022-10-21 20:51:18
3913," dollars. MLS broke attendance records. Tel Avivundo will break sales records were the woke up in Qatar. The ratings are there, the interest is there. At a grassroots level, I don't have to tell you everyone plays on the weekend in the parks, in the little league system, if you will. So I think there's tremendous excitement around this woke up. Lionel Messi has Brazil and France as the favorites, agree, disagree? Sure, whatever he says, I'll agree to. He like a good Argentinian, that's one of Jing's Argentinian's chances. I think Argentina will be up there. Argentina is in the path to play semi-final against Brazil, if all planets align. So I think whoever wins that semi-final will crown itself the champion of the world and on the other side. Francis, I believe, is on this side of the bracket. So if he said France, they have to play Argentina. So I don't think he saw the brackets. So it's going to be Argentina, Brazil on one side and I believe it's going to be either Spain or Germany on the other side. All right, should I try it before we go? Go! Go! There you go. Very good. Very good. Very good. Andre Skade, you have to do it for 64 games. I don't have the passion. I don't have the pipes. You'll hear him on Telemundo and on Peacock during the World Cup. Great to see you, sir. Thank you, Dave. Thank you. I do not have the passion. I was impressed. I was hoping you were going to give it a go. So, could I ask you for that one? You made a good point about now, make no mistake. Not a fan of Qatar hosting a World Cup because of the human rights situation. But Andre Skade made a great point about the size being a real advantage. It was prior in Russia, the largest country in the world by area. Teams traveled three, four, and five thousand miles throughout that World Cup. Now it's in the smallest country we've ever seen, the whole world cup. He thinks it's a huge advantage for the teams. They don't have to travel as much and the fans that are all going to see one another and interact with another. Now that's, of course, if the Qatari government treats them well, which is a big concern. Yeah, and Qatar has been a controversial choice ever since it did win the right to host this World Cup. It's going to be interesting. You touched on it at the timing of it. He was saying that he was a fan of the November December timeline ratings wise, at least here in the U.S. when you brought it up, just going up against the NFL. What that could potentially need for ratings here, you would think it would be a huge challenge. But we will see maybe because of the time difference of the games, it would actually work out okay. But I think there's a lot of hype. It won't dampen the Telemundo audience. That is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is that is our passionate. Alright, coming up, our business known for its meats, but the company now has a smoked bourbon and just know we had to try it for ourselves to close the week.

3914," Till all the tips you get are useful special! gras Tulomimi Arby's slogan remains we got the meats, but they also got the collaborations inspired by its 13 hour smoked brisket sandwich. Arby's this week teamed up with craft distilled re-brain brew to introduce a limited edition smoked bourbon. Smoke with the same wood used to smoke their meats. The bourbon went on sale Wednesday at arbysmoked bourbon.com. It's sold out immediately. They had a second drop today at noon. Flew off the website in a hurry. Thankfully we did get our hands on some. So I do want Shonda to try it. They comes with a smoker that you ordinarily put over this. So you take a little bourbon, you just pour it over the arby's ice cube, mind you. That's a big point. So you can literally put wood chips in here, light it on fire, and it would smoke the cocktail with the wood chips. It's a really nice tactic. Are you sure you don't want to try it? I don't want to make any fire here in the studio. Yeah, I could see. No, so I want to have you try it and see what you think. Don't worry, it won't taste like arby's meat per se. That's what I was a little bit nervous. It tastes good. I'm not a huge bourbon drinker, but it tastes, I'm going to go back first, I got one. You're going back again, so that can't be all that. It is pretty good, and I think that when we've talked about this time and time again, arby is just so smart, we can share. Arby's just so smart when it comes to their partnerships. This is far from the first time that they have teamed up with a liquor brand or somebody else to try and bring some innovation to their menus, some excitement, and clearly by what you just said, the fact that it's sold out twice, it's working. Flies off the shelves. They had a crinkle cut and curly fry vodka a year ago, and it came with a bloody Mary kit. It like this sold out. What do you think of it? I think it's fantastic. I am a bourbon guy though, unlike yourself. So this is a perfect way to end the week. I'd say it's about an eight and a half. I wish I would have let us lighten. We could have done the whole real smoked. Talk to the boss about that. I know, I guess it was a little bit too risky, but maybe I'll take another, one more sip before I walk out today, but I like it, and I was a little bit skeptical on all this. Alright, well cheers to everyone out there on a wonderful week, and that'll do for us on Yahoo Finance. I make sure to come back Monday at 3 p.m. Eastern Time.

3920," of about two tens of percent. In today here we did see some early waffling out of the gate. Yeah, that's your W to give you that waffling oscillation action. But also the S and P 500, you're seeing that up by about 1% right now, no testing of that flat line. It has just been up in the green off to the races here. Also speaking of off into the races, we are off into the races with Ernie season as of right now. We've got big tech coming out this week. We've also got in the auto's landscape Ford and GM. That's set to come out. Of course Tesla last week we brought that down for you, but taking a look at Ford here on the day. It's up by about two and a half percent to kick off the week. Also taking a look at GM. You're seeing that up by about one and a half percent. So GM, they're going to be reporting on Tuesday Ford that's going to come on Wednesday as well. And so those two companies certainly going to be in focus. GM stumbled out of the gate this morning. Was negative for a moment, but now steadily in positive territory up by about one and a half percent. And then also just taking a look at some of the other auto's here as well. You've got Rivian that's actually down by about three percent this morning. Keep a close eye on our IVN. And then lastly here lucid neo. You're seeing neo down by twenty, seventeen percent. Excuse me. And so we'll keep a close eye on neo as well as we move on throughout the rest of today's streaming session. That's a look at some of those EV names, but let's turn now to energy markets. Energy and crude are a political hand grenade for nearly every country this according to our next guest. OPEX relationship with the US and the US's use of the strategic petroleum reserve is just one of several flashpoints worldwide. With more, we've got Rebecca Babin, who is the senior energy trader over at CIBC, private, wealth, US. All right, help us break this down a little bit more. When you say political hand grenade, what should we expect to play out with regard to this? So that's a great question. I think what we should expect to play out is a lot of volatility going forward, right? We're looking at an escalation of the relationship between OPEX and the US and both parties trying to influence how crude trades, one by cutting production and supporting prices and the other by releasing barrels of the SPR into the market, right? So you have these dueling factions both trying to sway market pricing. This is a big deal because this is a market that traditionally trades on fundamentals, supply and demand. And now you have these two huge players kind of at the other end of the polls trying to influence the market. So that's one thing to expect. I expect that we will see more SPR releases come throughout the winter. Last week's announcement from Biden really was a reiteration of what he's already deployed, which was 180 million barrels in May. He said he's going to do the last 15 million barrels over the next month. There is room however for him to do more as we head into 2023 and I do expect that. On the other side of that equation I think we have OPEX Plus, which is going to continue to cut production and make sure that the market does not feel a lot of downward pressure. Why are they going to do this? Because macro, the macro environment is super challenging right now with cross-currents, Chinese demand as a huge concern, European recession as a huge concern. And they really want to support prices in the near term and not let the bottom fall out of crude as it has done in previous cycles. Then Rebecca, given those, you have OPEX Plus cutting, you have the body administration putting more oil out there on the market, what does that mean for prices? That's a great question. And a lot of that hinges on what happens as we head into the December 5th EU sanctions package and how much Russian crude is disrupted based on those sanctions. So I personally think the market is anticipating about a million barrels of Russian crude to be disrupted due to the increased sanctions and that ultimately the floor under crude is strong enough to hold, but the upside is a little bit more of the unknown. If we lose a million barrels of Russian crude and China demand starts to improve, and I know the data we saw today wasn't really indicative of that, but if it does, you could see a lot more upside. So I think ultimately you have downside kind of to that 70 to 75 range.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,2,2022-10-24 14:02:38
3921," of that, but if it does, you could see a lot more upside. So I think ultimately you have downside kind of to that 70 to 75 range and you have upside north of 100. So if you're looking at risk reward, it really feels like at this point we're fairly well balanced, but the upside tail looks a little bit more explosive. However, there are very few investors willing to put that money to work. If we look at positioning that came out over last week, we saw continued cutting of WTI Brent and gasoline products positioning as the market is really afraid of all of these risk and not really feeling comfortable making a bet either way. So I think that's what increases the volatility is the lack of positioning and this really these really outsides tails on either end of the spectrum here. Does China still want to be a purchaser of Russian oil supply? I think they do. So I think that it makes a lot of sense for them and if we just look at their most recent actions, they're increasing their imports of crude even though their demand for crude isn't increasing why? Because they increase their quota for export of product. So they're buying cheaper crude from Russia. They're increasing their refining capacity and they're selling that really expensive product out to the market as we have all talked about refining margins have been really really robust and they're able to turn that profit. It makes sense for them on a multitude of levels. It helps spark internal demand and keep the economy going a little bit. It feels a whole of the product supply that could be disrupted from Russia and they're able to turn a profit. So I do think they're going to continue to want Russian crude. I don't think they're going to be super public about it but I think they'll continue to buy it. Rebecca, we've seen some reports recently that looking at the heating oil market this winter, US consumers, they might see their bills go up anywhere from 20 to 30 percent. Does that sound about right to you? Yeah, it does and it's unfortunate but the reality is our heating oil inventories are very low. I mean the lowest I think that they've ever been. Does it mean that we're going to have run out of inventories? No. It means that we're going to have the potential for spikes particularly in a cold winter and I think it's drawing a lot of concern and that's why we're seeing China's really ramp up their diesel exports because those refining margins are so high for diesel. The US is in this situation because we've cut a lot of our refining capacity. So even though we have a lot of crude coming out of the ground, we don't necessarily have the refiner there to produce it into product to help meet these needs. So unfortunately, yeah, 20 to 25 percent I think is where prices are looking. If we get a mild winter, that could come in but it's really a weather dependent scenario and I think there's a lot of fear baked into that as well. Rebecca, I'm going to ask a question that is absolutely fueled by my own personal aspirations of seeing lower airline prices in the future and where in this environment they're purchasing from the different suppliers and refineries and particularly where that will actually net out for them to see lower fuel costs. We saw it show up in American Airlines earnings that they were paying 97 percent higher for some of their supply and so when will that start to subside for the airlines and their purchasing requirements that they need just to operate their routes? I don't think that subsides in the next six months or even maybe the next year, unfortunately, unless and this will be the sad scenario, we have more restrictive travel policies globally to to COVID but based on where things are right now, if the demand stays worse at and I kind of feel like it might, you don't really see that pullback in jet because again, you need someone to refine all that crude into jet fuel and right now it's more attractive to refine it into diesel because that has the higher refining margin. So you're going to use all your refinery capacity to diesel and then you'll do jet right until the price of jet becomes so expensive that people reconfigure their refiners to sell jet. So the sad answer is probably not for a little while. You might see a modest dip but I don't think you go back to kind of really, really attractive pricing from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,3,2022-10-24 14:06:52
3922," Jet, so the sad answer is probably not for a little while. You might see a modest dip, but I don't think you go back to kind of really, really attractive pricing for at least a year. Rebecca, I just purchased five new blankets from Target because I'm not hitting my thermostat this winter. I'm not touching it. It might be 60 degrees in my place, just not going near it.

Sounds global markets have been watching the situation China closely as President Xi consolidates power and enters an unprecedented third term as leader of the country. The move making many uneasy as US and China relations are already strained. Last week, Yao finances, Enter and Chief Andy Sober sat down with economist Noreal Roubini during the all market summit to discuss the state of US China relations and Andy joins us now. Andy, Dr. Doom always good to catch up with him. Yeah, Dr. Doom, Noreal Roubini saying that we're already in a third cold war with China. So not very good for the sensibility there are the markets. But when you're talking about Xi Jinping consolidating power, Brian, over the last week, it really wasn't a surprise. But I think the particulars surprised people how he did it. I mean, if you saw, for instance, the footage of the former president, Hu Jintao being removed forcibly from those meetings that was really chilling. I mean, look at this stuff. And this is all for show because this didn't have to be done. I mean, what a humiliation for the former president. And you see Xi Jinping just sitting there. Some people were saying that, well, he was Hu Jintao was not well and needed to be removed. But that didn't have to be done publicly like that, I think. There's a number of things going on in China. And I think that the peaceful transition of power in this authoritarian regime has been something that has actually really been kind of remarkable for China since Mao Zedong. And now you've got a situation where instead of two terms is three terms. That's unsettling. A couple of other points you guys that are also unsettling. One, using the zero tolerance COVID policy to turn the country more into a surveillance state. Number one, number two, also reducing corruption and trying to address wealth inequality. But also using that as an opportunity to remove political opponents is something else that Xi Jinping has done. And if you look and see how the markets in China and the Hang saying have responded, that is not a pretty picture in my understanding is that's the worst drop since 2007, 2008. So stand, Druck and Miller was talking the other day. You need to look forward 18 months, 24 months out. What does it look like? This situation is not going to be a great situation, I think, for tech stocks, for Chinese stocks, for companies that have big exposure there. So it's unsettling and unnerving. There's still so much that is unresolved on the tit for attack trade war that took place back during the Trump administration. And so even now, with this move in China, what does that signal for the Biden administration in terms of the broader business component here in rectifying some of those issues that still are unresolved? Well, Brad, it's not like President Biden has reduced those tariffs. And in fact, he's imposed measures that are arguably more harsh when it comes to the tech sector and chips. And you can understand that because when you're talking about surveillance, this is a real risk to the US economy and to the global economy. On the other hand, it's not doing anything to increase trade and kind of leave the attention. And then, of course, hanging out across the horizon there is Taiwan and the situation there. And how that is going to be resolved, that is something that is very much front and center on Xi Jinping's agenda. And how that transpires if and when China ever reclaims that island nation as part of China per se, it's going to be a very, very touchy thing going forward. I'm not telling you guys any, you don't know. But I guess the bottom line is things are not ready to really dispel your needs?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,5,2022-10-24 14:15:47
3924," that island nation is part of China per se, is going to be a very, very touchy thing going forward. I'm not telling you guys any, you don't know. But I guess the bottom line is, things are not really getting better, and what's really interesting, and back to your original point, Brad, is Republican president, Democratic president, continuity, right? Same thing, and so that's tough for relations there. Hey, that footage at the top. Wow, that was just jarring. Yeah, it's shocking. And, you know, again, people are saying, oh, he wasn't well. Well, you know, they could have just said, we're going to take a pause here, turn the camera off. That was when Westerners were there. Chinese media not reporting on that, but the footage is out all over the place. So in other words, the Chinese leadership wanted this footage out there. They didn't want to comment on it. And, you know, look at this. Just, it's just, no, almost no acknowledgement. You know, straight, right? No, look at that body language right there. Yeah. Wow, right, yeah. That's crazy. Unreal. Wow. All right, we'll leave it there for right now. I'll find Senator and Chief End user. I'm always going to see you. Thank you. Appreciate it. All right, sifting through the social media stock wreckage more on that straight ahead. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. The snaps are poor to send first shock waves throughout a social media landscape struggling with slowing growth, bloated costs, and weak stock prices. So what's the next shoot to drop here? Rote research senior analyst, Rocco Strauss joins us now discuss. Rocco, good to see this morning. Is it time to start picking at the rubble here? Are you just stay away from the space? I guess with respect to SNAP, I mean, there still remains to be an unfavorable apricot hasn't mixed for them. With SNAP being heavily dependent on discussionary spend, when you think about the VC bag, grocery and crypto app installed, you know, budgets vanishing in the last quarter or so. It's still an overhang from Apple's ADT or the IDFA issue, weighing on gaming budgets. And SNAP is now a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,6,2022-10-24 14:19:56
3925," the T or the IDFA issue weighing on gaming budgets. And Snap is now also seeing brand budgets moving to the sidelines, which is probably like the macrohead from that death lacking. So your best proxy is probably looking back to 0809, where 2008 was still a fine year for ad agencies and a lot of brands spent and then 09s or a year after, literally met another things hit. You saw like a minus 10% or so hit on top line on these guys. So if I could just snap, I would still say that against, like TikTok and other social media networks, there is a lot of utility on the platform, especially with messaging. There's a lot of first party data that they have. And they're also like if you undermonitize ventures like maps and spotlight, building AR features in an e-commerce environment and so on. And that actually makes a slightly positive on the prospects of Snap if they continue to invest through this recessionary environment. Is there a turnover in favorability of social media platforms? And if so, which ones are slated to continue to win kind of the screen wars and that attention for time, which directly correlates back into where and why advertisers would want to spend their dollars on these platforms? Right. I mean, I guess what you have seen now on Spotlight, on Snap, you could say, you could talk about YouTube shorts, you could talk about Reels on Instagram. All these are kind of me to offering this what TikTok is doing. And the question that we would raise is moving forward maybe a year from now, are we talking about TikTok stealing time away from these properties? Or are we having more utility alongside these other me two offerings that keeps people on the more established social media networks? It's hard to say where user adoption is going to go to. But there's a huge risk for TikTok now, not the other way around. Well, then how does Snap go about restoring investor confidence? Yeah, I mean, as what I had pointed out, it is really kind of like changing this advertiser makes going more into DR, especially e-commerce related offerings. It's an integration with Shopify, the other others like that out there. That's what you have to prove. And you have to start monetizing these ventures where you are not seeing ads right now, especially Spotlight, which will draw some of these TikTok budgets, which will think about also other video budgets coming live with respect to Netflix and Disney+, which will draw a lot of the linear TV budgets over into digital. And they are likely also going to end up in some of these social media networks. All of the social media networks right now are trying to become the shopping mall or at least replace them need for going to physical retail and drive more conversion. Can they successfully fill the void where perhaps that in-person shopping experience can be offset by that virtual shopping experience driven by interest and then actual purchase decisions. And do you see that actual amount of money that's going to be spent on this platform on these platforms improving over the near term as well? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a few things that need to happen there, right? First, we have to work on friction. Friction between looking at products, buying them, after sales service with respect to messaging integrations and so on. And these platforms are working on that. You see that with click to messaging functionality on WhatsApp, you know, in the meta universe, and we are going to see more of that. The second thing that we need to see is more integration of inventory. So literally everyone of these social media platforms has integrated with Shopify now. There are many more similar offerings like Shopify out there to think about like a WooCommerce, for example, and so on. These need to happen and need to be smooth as well. And you have to think about like combined baskets so that a checkout experience, you know, might work significantly easier than it is today. And then lastly, when you also think about all these ID headwinds that we're having and Apple's ATT is just the beginning, right? You have to think about like SDK runtime on Android. You have to think about cookies disappearing for many of these retailers. Both OmniTanel and smaller DTC brands, it is becoming significantly harder to track from an ad to a conversion if there is not an on-platform checkout functionality embedded into that. So the more we are going towards in that direction of IDs disappearing, the more likely we're going to see adoption of these on-platform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,7,2022-10-24 14:24:23
3926," and bettered into that. So the more we are going towards in that direction of ideas disappearing, the more likely we're going to see adoption of these on-platform functionalities and that should increase the shopping that we're seeing on these platforms. Okay, and so with so much of that focus on shopping, being either prompted by the consumer data that the companies, the social media platforms are looking at, or just by the trends of how many people are just comfortable spending their money through a social media platform, does that mean that there's an authenticity vacuum with legacy social media right now? If everybody's just trying to sell me on something and content creators, I know that they're in partnership with someone who wants to get my dollar at the end of the day, then where do I go to actually just have that valuable connection? Yeah, I mean, if you think about some of the larger retailers out there, right? So name Amazon, name Etsy, name eBay. One of these have an issue that they don't really have any social media connections or offerings on the side. Amazon might be with Twitch, but still small compared to other social media networks. But what all of them have and throw a Shopify in the bucket as well is they have huge audiences and they have huge intent and conversion data. And if that sort of data can be made actionable into these social media environments and that brings us, you know, like also into the discussion of clean rooms and privacy laws and so on, but if that data can be made actionable, then we're not going to be overloaded with shopping related ads and it's going to be likely significantly more targeted than we have seen it so far. Okay, all right. Perhaps just my own sugar in that I inserted there into the conversation and we're gonna take research, senior analysts, the ROCRO Strauss, we appreciate your analysis of all these companies and breaking that down for us this morning. Thanks. Coming up, Big Tech earnings are on tap this week, but what does this mean for ETF investors? We've got that conversation for you next.� Sir, immediately here is a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,8,2022-10-24 14:29:14
3927," All eyes are on big tech this week with Apple, Amazon and Meta plus Alpha Bed. All set to report earnings. But how will this impact ETF investors? Let us identify head of research Todd Rosenbluth joins us now to discuss. Okay, so help us break this down. I mean, with regard to some of the ETF trends that we've seen this far, what are inflows looking like into tech sector ETFs? Well, the technology sector has been relatively strong in 2022. We've seen over $6 billion of money go into technology ETFs that's following on with some of the more defensive sectors. So we've seen strong inflows into consumer staples, strong inflows into utilities. Healthcare has actually been the leading sector, whereas consumer discretionary and communication services sectors have seen net outflows. And as we tie into the big tech earnings that you talked about, it really matters what ETF we're talking about and whether how it's classified. Todd, where do you see investors gravitating to more specifically in the tech? Are they still staying clear of anything that owns a social media stock? I think what the real focus for them is understanding what is inside these portfolios. So we mentioned earlier meta and alpha beta reporting results. Those are classified as communication services companies in many of the sector ETFs. So you would find that in XLC, which is the communication services selector spider ETF, but you would not find meta or alpha bet within the technology selector spider, which is XLC or the Vanguard information technology ETF VGT because of those, these sector ETFs are tied to the Gix sector framework and S&P and MSCI classified companies like Apple and Microsoft as technology companies like meta and alpha bet as communication services companies. And so the devil is in the details as to what's inside these portfolios. So with regard to all of these big tech names, it's still going to come down to what their free cash flow looks like and where they're maintaining margins within their businesses. Some of them very much advertising focused or all of their businesses advertising, whereas some of them have a little bit more at play with regard to Amazon there. And so what would you be watching kind of throughout these tech earnings to see where they're maintaining some of those margins? So I think the focus for all of these companies were likely to see the currency headwinds happen. And so these companies are multinational in nature, it's different how their exposure happens to be, but we've had a strong US dollar that is going to weigh down on overall profitability. It just comes down to how profitable they were before the currency impact. And so a company like Apple, which is again in the technology sector and part of VGT or XLK, the demand for iPhone is going to be important. A company like Meta of course that's tied to search, you're going to have different impact search as well as social media, you're going to have a different impact as well. So I'm not an expert on individual companies, but I do think investors are looking to get exposure to these companies through the diversification benefits of an ETF and they need to know what's inside those ETFs. Todd, is anything surprised you this earnings season? I think it's been better than we've seen and expected. I think financials has been relatively strong and you get exposure to financials through the financial select sector, spider ETF and through bank oriented ETFs like the spider S&P bank ETF. I think it's been relatively strong. The bar tends to be set relatively low, heading into earnings season and companies have been exceeding that relatively low bar. But we'll see what happens. And again, ETF investors get the benefits of diversification across the sector as opposed to having to pick an individual winner heading into an after-earning season. Do you expect that any of these companies will either revise downward their guidance or pull guidance? I don't think we're going, I don't have the expertise to be able to dive into individual companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,9,2022-10-24 14:32:59
3928," are there guidance or pull guidance? I don't think we're going to have the expertise to be able to dive into individual companies, but what tends to happen when companies report results, they tend to beat the expectations and then the guidance takes a look at where we are from an economic perspective. And so the dollars likely to continue to be strong, or likely to see the impact of rising interest rates, impact the overall economy, and recession has been top of mind for many companies. So they're more likely to lower the bar and again, seek to exceed that during earning season, giving investors something else to watch beyond the current forecast, looking further into the future. I wish you were here, Todd, because the big energy is flowing on this desk between me and Brad. We are psyched for app earnings. This is a big, big week of earnings. Always an exciting time for all of us. Vetify head of research, Todd Rosenbluth. Good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. All right, midterms are just two weeks away. A new poll finds that the Dems are facing a tough fight in the key swing state of Ohio. Tomorrow, let's bring in our very own senior columnist, Rick Newman. Rick. They're facing a lot of tough fights, and it's looking pretty clear at this point that Republicans are very likely to take back the House. The Senate might be 50-50, but to go to that Senate race in Ohio, that's where Tim Ryan, the current congressman, is facing JD Vance. And I mean, there you see, it's tied. This is interesting, because President Trump won Ohio in 2020 by a considerable margin. So in this race, the Democrat actually is outperforming, but that is not the case in some other states where Nevada, for example, where Democrat incumbents are in real trouble. So it looks like we're going to have divided government after the midterm elections. That is not a bad thing for markets. What it mostly means is that we're just not going to see any significant legislation during the next two years. Okay, so Rick, with all the key races that we have been watching here, I mean, is there going to be any actual legislative agenda changes, any policy headway that gets made post-election? The one thing that's gotten a lot of attention recently is Kevin McCarthy in the House, who would probably be speaker if Republicans take the House. He has indicated that Republicans may not sign off on or easily sign off on the next extension of the federal borrowing limit. That's probably going to come up in mid to late 2023. And that means we could have one of these standoffs that we've seen before where the federal government can't borrow money. It goes right down to the wire. This type of standoff led to the downgrade of U.S. debt all the way back in 2011. So we might get another one of those. Republicans have also suggested they may not easily sign off on funding for military aid to Ukraine. McCarthy said, don't expect a blank check on that. So that's another thing to watch. But for markets, we're not going to have any tax increases. That seems very sure. We're not going to have any big new spending programs. So there is often a rally in the stock market after the midterm elections. And some people are saying maybe that'll be a little bit of something fueling a late year rally this year. Rick, what do you think, look, the political wins are constantly changing day to day. But what do you think is the biggest issue in the minds of voters? Is it still gas prices and heating all costs like we've been talking to yours? It's something like just popped up recently. The federal, the loan changes to the student loan program being blocked. I, you know, I think this is actually shifted. So obviously the Biden administration paid a lot of attention to gas prices during the last four months, let's say, and Biden has been releasing oil from the strategic reserve to get that down. Gas prices are now around $3.80, which I think is okay. I think what has snuck up on Biden has been these other types of inflation. I mean, we've seen food inflation is now 13%. Moody's Analytics has a nice piece of analysis out today saying they think one of the biggest factors in midterm elections is real disposable income. And on that, so that's your income, your paycheck after inflation. And Biden, the Biden economy is doing very poorly on real disposable income, mainly just because inflation is eating away at wage gains. So all of this makes people think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,10,2022-10-24 14:37:22
3929," is doing very poorly on real disposable income. Mainly just because inflation is eating away at wage gains. So all of this makes people feel really unhappy and when they're unhappy, they blame the incumbents. So that is one of the big reasons Biden's Democrats are probably gonna take it on the chin. You look happy, Rick. I'm happy. Brad's happy. So happy. Let's bring on the wake. Brick Newman, thanks so much. Hi, guys. Coming up, vegetarians listen up. A new Beyond Meat item is coming soon. And we'll discuss next. Welcome back to Y'all for Finance Live, everyone. Just over a little bit, just over an hour actually into today's trading session here. And taking a look at the SEP 500, we actually dipped into negative territory here for a hot moment, reverse course, back and positive territory, up by about half a percent right now. The NASDAQ composite, you're also seeing that still in the red as right now, early morning oscillation that we were tracking, but now we're down by about half a percent there. So we'll keep it close to there. And the Dow Jones industrial average, you're seeing that hold on to gains. It's up by about 9 tenths of a percent right now. Some of the other movers that have been keeping close tabs on this morning as well, been watching retail, Amazon, of course, that's going to be reporting earnings later on this week, but also in tandem with that watching Walmart here. It's up by about 1.6%. You're seeing Costco up by about 2.2% here, early in the morning in Target or Tarsier. That's up by about 7 tenths of a percent. But then additionally here, just quickly checking in on some of the pharmacy benefits managers. And here's why the Walgreens Flu Index is actually 10 times higher right now year over year. This comes after the CDC had actually given out warning last week about an elevated level for flu coinciding with the, of course, COVID, the novel coronavirus as well. And so with that going into the next weeks and months of the winter, we're going to be keeping close eye on the virus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,11,2022-10-24 14:42:02
3930," of course COVID, the novel coronavirus as well. And so with that going into the next weeks and months of the winter, we're gonna be keeping a close eye on that. Louisiana, Texas Mississippi seemed to be trending the highest as of right now. We're seeing Walnut Green's boots alliance shares down flat bits of the downside right now on the day. A lot of green though on the screen for the other PBM sauce. Yeah, although supermarkets shut out, it's definitely had me excited about Apple earnings later in the week, Brad. All right, switching gears here. The internal revenue service announced a welcome cost of living adjustment to the US's marginal tax rate that will increase the take home pay for many workers in 2023. Joining us now with more on the latest tax brackets is Blue Ocean and Global Wealth CEO Margarita Cheng. Margarita, good to see you here this morning. So what do these changes mean to the average consumer? So this is actually a positive. Who would have thought inflation is positive, but because inflation has been at the highest level in 40 years what that means is you could find yourself in a lower tax bracket because the IRS has raised the income level so you could be earning the same if not slightly more and still end up in the same tax brackets. Okay, so all right, help me understand this. Like how quickly does this go into effect? I mean, is this just immediate? Sure, I definitely can understand. So I know that we just finished taxes in April. There are some people who filed an extension so they just submitted their 2020 return October 15th and I know we're in 2022 and 2022 is not over but we are planning for 2023. So here's the takeaway. The US tax system is not a flat tax system. It is progressive, it's graduated. So there are, as you can see on the screen, there are seven tax brackets. The lowest is 10%. The highest is 37. So I want people to understand is if you find yourself in the middle 24% tax bracket, that does not mean that you pay 24% on all $364,000. You pay 10% on the first 11, then from 11, then it goes up. So that's what we mean by graduated. So Maya, this does go into effect for 2023 and the reason why it is going into effect is the IRS has made adjustments. I don't need to tell you all that inflation is real and this is based on costs of goods and services for 80,000 items. Okay, and so with all of this in mind, how does this actually impact the real take home wages for people? Does it change anything there? So assuming your income is the same and your income has not gone up, you very well could be in a lower tax brackets. The other takeaway is the IRS has raised the standard deduction. So they have raised the standard deduction for somebody who is single by $900 and they've raised the standard deduction for somebody who's married by $1800. So what that means is you certainly can itemize your deductions, but if your itemized deductions do not exceed the standard deduction, you'd be better off taking the standard deduction. So that's essentially how it can impact everyday individuals and families. Margarit, since these changes have come to light, what are some of the biggest questions you've gotten from your clients? So the first question is, and this was surprising for folks. So what can we do about this? How does this affect me? So the first thing I've told people is you want to visit the IRS tax withholding calculator and just because you don't want to be unpleasantly surprised. So the first thing is check that out and if you do need to adjust your withholding, you want to complete a W4. The other thing that people have asked about is the limits. The IRS has increased the 401K contribution limit by $2,000. So that is a very significant increase. So for individuals under 50, they can now contribute $22,500. They can also contribute $500 more to an IRA or Roth IRA. They can also increase their contribution to a health care flexible spending account. The thing that has been shocking for people who...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,12,2022-10-24 14:46:00
3931," They have also increased their contribution to a health care flexible spending account. The thing that has been shocking for people who have young children is the dependent care spending account amount has not been adjusted. It is still at $5,000. So this is how it has impacted individuals and families. All right, our taxes. For retirees as well. There you go. Thank you so much for breaking this down. We have taxes of place that we never want to be unpleasantly surprised at global wealth, blue ocean, global wealth, chief executive officer, Mark and Rita Chang. Rita, thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. Switching gears, everyone. Shares of Beyond Meat. Today, wow. The other down 5 percent after the plant-based meat company announced a new offering beyond steak. Yeah, we'll find out. And this is Brooke DiPolma is here with the details, bro. That's right, Brad, Beyond Meat looking to cook up some excitement here. We're doing the opposite. As you said, shares down nearly 6 percent this morning. Of course, some frozen food comes out today beyond steak. It's seared. It's bite-sized pieces and can be prepared. And what they're saying, either a skillet or an air fryer in just five minutes, of course, this comes as the frozen food section. See a bit of a boom here. This year, $70 billion in sales happened for the frozen food aisle. That's a 31 percent jump since 2019. But if you take your closer look at this offering, they're really looking to expand it to a broad audience from meat lovers, flexitarians alike. It includes 21 grams of protein per serving. They're saying it's low and saturated fat, 0 miligame of cholesterol. But if you look at where it's being offering, really looking to hit across the U.S. today, Beyond Steaks, launching at Crocker, Walmart, Albertsons, and A-hole divisions, of course, that's the name that we may not know exactly, but I've seen, especially here, in New York. That includes stop and shop giant food lion and fresh direct. Of course, this adds to the Beyond Meat portfolio back in 2020. We saw Beyond Meat add meatballs at Costco. We also see that opportunity at Target. But the Beyond Steak yet to be determined if this would be offered there as well, of course, meat saying here that this was a highly anticipated expansion to its beef lineup, which now includes burgers, beef, sausage, and meatballs. But yet to be determined, just how excited Main Street is and Wall Street this morning, like I said before, down nearly 6% shares of Beyond Meat. So not drumming up too much excitement here. Now, Brooke, yeah, 21 grams of protein call definitely important for folks, such as myself and our former Fed course, Bonner, Brian Chung. But look, Beyond Meat just had a lot of layoffs. How do they launch a product like this? Yeah, that's a great question. Of course, last week, the brand's announced it's set to cut 19% of its global workforce. Of course, that included their chief operating officer Doug Ramsey, who is a rest day in late September for allegedly biting a man's nose at an Arkansas football game. In addition to that, if you take a look year to date one year ago, right here, it is down 87%. Now, year to date down 80%. And if you take a look back to their IPO in 2019, it is down 81%. Now, in addition to that, dealing with a lot of other noise out there in October 18th, Beyond Meat and Plant-based Food Maker, Don Lee settled to dispute over previous partnership. Both sides are satisfied with the outcome according to court filings. But Beyond Meat really looking to push forward, looking to come out with these innovations, hoping to grab consumers attention. Of course, here, they're keep on pushing on, I guess you could say here, calling it once again, a highly anticipated expansion, really looking to continue to enthuse and excite consumers about these new offerings. Work while we have you with all of the expansions that they've been making, they had been investing so much into taking the operations under their own helm, not licensing or renting space at other manufacturing practices in at least areas. And so with that in mind, investors have had to price in how much they're spending of their own money just to make sure that they can bring more of that operation in houses. Is it clear how they're doing in terms of producing all of these new menu items? Yeah, that's a great question. Well, what we can relate that to is the test that they did with McDonald's in hopes to launch that McPlan and while it launched in the UK and Ireland overseas, it's really, you know, TBD on what exactly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,13,2022-10-24 14:50:24
3932," with McDonald's in hopes to launch that McPlan. And while it launched in the UK and Ireland overseas, it's really, you know, TBD on what exactly that will look like, what exactly we might see that nationwide here in the US. So investors really standing by and waiting to see if all these major investments that they're putting out are seeing a return on that share price. Yeah, we'll find it's on Brook to Palmo with a breakdown on Beyond Meet this morning. We appreciate it, I appreciate it, Brook, not Beyond. It's Monday, it is Monday, let's Monday. Ryan Brad Brook, it's the eye. I know we are bullish on BR's around here at Yahoo Finance. Thanks so much, Brook, appreciate it. Come and grab everyone Walmart, relaunching and renaming. It's Sleepwear brand. We've got the details next. Slapah, the base. It's time for Cut for Time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. Walmart is reinventing its intimits and sleepwear line, replacing the billion dollar brand secret treasures with the more modern and contemporary style brand, Joy Spun. I don't know. I just take me back to what Walmart did. This was 10 or 15 years ago, almost an analyst. They made it to a big push into more high-end fashion and their parallel is a complete flop. I'm going to be very fascinating to see how a brand like this does inside of Walmart, which really for the past 10 years, since that really dreadful push into fashion has just been focused on very affordable cheap basics. I don't know the prices on these, but this looks a little bit more fashionable than I think Walmart is known for. Tell about the homegrown brands. I mean, Walmart, of course, has some big partners on the apparel front that has allowed them to move into, of course, all of these storefront locations brick and mortar that Walmart dominates in. But then it comes down to, all right, where's Walmart also growing up their own brands.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,14,2022-10-24 14:54:54
3933," of them to move into, you know, of course, all of these storefront locations brick and mortar that Walmart dominates in, but then it comes down to, all right, where is Walmart also growing up their own brands? Walmart doing this target or tarjet doing that. Amazon also doing this too. Amazon has what, 12 of its own homegrown lines. And so it's really just that ease of knowing you're in the store to perhaps get some of your eggs there and instead, you know what, I'll get the intimates from there. Not going, and money geek finding that burger combos are 9% more expensive than last year, the three most expensive cities to order a burger meal in our San Francisco launch at Los Angeles in New York. And Brad, I'm not surprised by this. I believe about a month ago, I ordered myself two breakfast sandwiches from McDonald's. Now I get double leg, I get double meat. I pay $28 and I didn't even get a drink. $28 along Island, New York for two. Again, not the standard order, but I go into McDonald's, I have a touch screen, I customize everything. I mean, it was $28 for two sandwiches. You what? I know. I had to do a double take. I was just absolutely shocked. Wait, why didn't you? They were good. You didn't select a combo? No, I just, I like building my own sandwich because I need the double leg, I need the double meat, like I'm hungry. I'm really hungry. I mean, I get that, but you got to make sure you're getting this. I know. Drinked. I'm not surprised. Look at these combo meals. You walk into a lot of these restaurants now. I mean, they are no longer common meals were started to essentially save people money. Now, look at this. Are you kidding me? But when you look at the history of when some of these combo meals originated to, it was during economic downturns. There are these pullbacks in some of the consumer discretionary categories too, trying to make more of a value-pushing value play. All right, guys, let's talk about my beloved Philadelphia Phillies here. Today, the latest recession indicator could be the Philadelphia Phillies winning the World Series. Every Phillies World Series win or I should say Philadelphia baseball team win in the last 100 years has been followed by an economic downturn. It was the Philadelphia Athletics that kind of kicked that off. They were seeing there in 1929 and then later on, the Phillies 1980. I remember 2008 and the Pandemonium that just absolutely ensued after the Philadelphia has won the World Series. It was a great time, but not so much economically at least. I want to support everything, I always want to support you, but I can't root for the Phillies. I can't root for the Phillies because they just boo everybody. What was it, Jill Biden, the first lady two weeks ago at the Eagles game? She got booed, they've booed Santa Claus. How am I can't put my support behind the Phillies? That's not specific. Even though the Astros, even the Astros just demolished my Yankees and they, you know, someone would say they are more cheaters. They are cheaters. But, I mean, Philly, you can't boo the first lady and Santa Claus? We boo everybody. Santa Claus. We boo everybody. That's mascot. We got Gritty and we got the Philadelphia man. That's Gritty. Yeah, and for a while we had a bunny rabbit as the Sixers mascot as well, hip hop. And so with all of this in mind, I mean, look, we're a fandom that's known to fight our own athletes in parking lot. I understand. I'm a Polish dancer. All right, coming up, Kiko Fajida and Ajali Kamani will speak to see a quest. Diagnostics, you won't want to miss it again. Markets are hanging puff, starting the week on a pretty good note. Dow up more. I don't know what it was. It's just a dog right now.

3934," when...... Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what we're watching at this hour. Coronation complete. Chinese president Xi Jinping secures a third term as leader consolidating power. But investors given the cold shoulder is greater China market sell off on economic uncertainty. Bracing for another tech rec, Big Tech prepares to report quarterly results this week. The digital ad flowed on firmly in focus after snaps free fall last week. And looking for stability. Sterling gets a bump as the UK gets its latest prime minister former chancellor, Sunak Rishi Sunak steps into 10 downing street as fresh data points to a deep down term. First, let's check in on the market action, though. We are 90 minutes into the trading day right now. A bit of a split picture, obviously. The NASDAQ going to be the big focus of the week with those big tech earnings on tap. It is down about 26 points right now. The Dow, up 256 points, though. And the S&P 500 up 20. We're also watching the bonnills closely here. We've talking about a bit of a pull back last week on potentially a Fed pivot up. We are seeing those yields back up today. Take a look at the 10 year yield that 428, the 30 year yield now well above 4.4%. We are beginning this hour, though, with all eyes on China. President Xi Jinping officially securing a third term on Sunday, making him the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Xi consolidating power by packing the Politburo standing committee with the most loyal to him. China's third quarter GDP data delayed by a week came in above estimates with growth at 3.9% in year over year. But a robust recovery remains elusive as China faces challenges, such as persistent COVID-19 curves and global recession risks. We should point out that that stocks lower in greater China on investor fears of Xi's new term, favoring ideology driven policies over growth. The Hang Seng and Hong Kong captains were state since the financial crisis in 2008. And the Shanghai Comp also down about 2% there. Major Chinese tech names also falling into the red on concerns about Xi's embrace of state-owned firms versus private companies. We've got a panel for you to break it all down for us. We've got China-Bajibok co-founder and CEO, Lila Miller, alongside Keith Krack, his chairman of the Krack Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. And gentlemen, it's great to have both of you on today. Lila, let me just start with you on the reaction that we got overnight in the Asia session here. It certainly looks like it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,16,2022-10-24 15:03:42
3935," see at Purdue and gentlemen, this great to have both of you on today. Leland, let me just start with you on the reaction that we got overnight in the Asia session here. Certainly, it looks like investors not feeling very comfortable with which direction China is now heading in with she securing his third term. What do you make of this sell off? Well, it's not altogether clear whether whether markets believe China's economic data this time around, but what's pretty clear is that nobody was very happy with the way that she packed the new leadership with loyalists. I think there was always a desire to see somebody who symbolized more market openings, disagreements in the top leadership, some sort of wholesome pushback against COVID-0. Look, you can read Tee Leaves a million different ways here, but when you look at who he put up next to him, it looks like it's going to be the she-show with very little pushback against him. I think that worries people who have watched the crackdowns of the last two years. Leland, just to follow up there, I mean, this did seem very much like a focus more on sort of national security, not necessarily on economic policy. And I know we don't come to expect that at the party congress, but we're still looking at a growth rate here, well above that 5.5 percent target that was initially set out for the year. What does that tell you about where the economic priorities are for the third term for this president? I just think the economic priorities have completely changed from this time around. We've been taught as China watchers to see the party as prioritizing growth above all. And that has been true for the last 5, 10, 15 years. It is not true anymore. The China we're looking at right now, led by Xi Jinping, is one focused more on security, it's focused more on restructuring the economy. So there's fewer vulnerabilities for the party in terms of reckless credit expansion in the property sector, shadow, finance out of control. They want to take control of the economy, reroute the economic growth model. And to do that, they have to materially slow down the economy, stop pumping credit in. So things are changing dramatically. They're not forgetting about the economy, but the Chinese economic growth model, as we know, it is over. And they're shifting to a more realistic stance. Keith, certainly from the US perspective, a lot to watch here in terms of the language that came out of the party congress. One thing, certainly those in Washington watching here, the changing in terms of the language with the party's constitution here, specifically on Taiwan, using the word strengthened fighting spirit and ability deterring any kind of separatists, or saying that they are, in fact, still moving in the direction of reunification. Why don't you take away from this party congress in terms of the timeline China is now thinking about in terms of reunification? Well, I don't think there's any doubt, Keiko, that she is committed to that. She is not only the most powerful dictator since Mao, but he's probably the most powerful dictator in the world since Hitler. And he's probably even more dangerous. So I think a question for your viewers is not just what's the data, what's the analysis. Leland is one of the great experts of the world on that. The question is, we know what's happening. There's no limit to his ambitions. So the question is, in terms of business boardrooms, what are you going to do about it? And what are the moral responsibilities? What are the fiduciary duties that shareholders have to mitigate risk with these board members have to mitigate that risk for their shareholders? And I've spent a lot of time with the corporate boards out here in Silicon Valley. And all of these folks are putting together China contingency plans because they see the crackdown on the private sector. They see the draconian COVID lockdowns and they see no limit to his ambition for power. To what extent have those risks been elevated because of that consolidation of power that we saw over the weekend? When you said that you're talking to companies and their boards, what do those contingency plans now look like? Well, they cover a number of things. First of all, they cover supply chains because if there's any bottlenecks there, they all saw that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,17,2022-10-24 15:07:41
3936," Well, they cover a number of things. First of all, they cover supply chains. Because if there's any bottlenecks there, they all saw that during COVID. So that was a wake up call. The other big wake up call was when cheese totalitarian twin, put invaded Russia and 300 companies had to come out. They lost hundreds of billions. The China problems 10 to 20 time X that. So if there's a conflict in Taiwan, it's not only disastrous for the business community. It's catastrophic for the tech business because of Taiwan's lock on on semi conduct. They also see the risk of cheap nationalizing firms, nationalizing, not being able to get their their money out of there. But the also big question now that's popping up, Akeko is these crimes against humanity. They're committing in places like Xinjiang, United States and several other countries have labeled that genocide. So there's a real moral issue because they export that slave labor all throughout China. And we have already seen legislation here in the U.S. to crack down on some of that. Leila, last question to you. You know, as you know, these party congresses are very closely orchestrated. Every single detail is really, doesn't go without a hitch. And yet we saw what was kind of an awkward moment here where we saw the former president, Hujin Tao, being escorted out. He's sitting right next to Xi Jinping there. It appeared at least that he didn't want to go. And there's been a lot being made of that. What exactly was the message Xi Jinping was trying to send if it was, in fact, that? What was your read on that moment that we saw over the weekend? You know, it's hard to know for sure. We know that it was a pretty big humiliation for who. But are we absolutely sure this is part of a public urge of the Communist Youth League faction, which barely exists anymore? That's not clear at all. Whose son was in the room? He's in the Polo Bureau. So I guess if we track his career over the coming months, we'll be able to get indications of whether this is something that was specific against who or was some other dynamic. But very weird, was such a choreographed event. It is weird to have a spectacle like that that left people talking all weekend. So we're going to just have to watch the politics in the next couple of months to see what this was all about. OK, I appreciate you both joining us today, China-Bajibok, co-founder and CEO, Lila Miller, along with Keith Krock, he's chairman of the Krock Institute for Tecta Polmese at Purdue. Well, turning now, looking ahead at the week ahead for markets, we have Yahoo finances and as for here to break it all down. And as a force we're talking about, the big tech names reporting here, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, you name it. Yeah, it's the Super Bowl of earnings really when you're talking about these big tech names. And as you just mentioned, these are the big mega caps that will be reporting earnings this week. And what's will be interesting to watch is Apple, Microsoft, Tuesday, Alphabet, Amazon on Thursday, Meta on Wednesday. But look, these companies, they're outsized, waiting in the S&P 500 is significant. Earnings per share are expected to fall year over year. But really the ones to watch for it, in my opinion, are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. Because Meta, you could say, has already gotten whacked and part of that has to do with advertising part it has to do with also Meta's strategy pivoting towards the Metaverse, which it announced earlier this year. But really, it will be interesting to watch Apple, what Apple says about China, what the advertising looks like when it comes to Meta, when it comes to Alphabet. And YouTube, for example. And then most importantly, also, is any talk of FX. For an exchange and how the currencies have been impacting revenue for these companies, for these companies that produce services. And also, they sell their products abroad. Amazon, 30% of its e-commerce comes from the international market. So it'll be interesting to watch to see how the strong dollar is impacting their performance. And it'll be interesting to see if they talk about constant currency, which is basically where they strip out that volatility. Also, to watch out for for this week, preliminary reading of GDP. So for the third quarter, that's expected to come in at 2.3% after the first and second quarter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,18,2022-10-24 15:12:00
3937," fertility. Also to watch out for for this week, preliminary reading of GDP. So for the third quarter, that's expected to come in at 2.3 percent after the first and second quarter were contractions. So it'll be interesting to watch. Yeah, you mentioned FX, certainly something that we've heard from so many companies. It's also going to be interesting to hear what Apple has to say about this latest regulation coming down from the Biden administration on semiconductors because they've already frozen the use of YMTC chips, one of those Chinese makers that are now basically, you know, sort of their band from selling to that. It'll be interesting if they talk about that, if they have any commentary on that, and also, of course, their iPhone demand and China supply chain. I mean, there's so much to talk about when we talk about Apple because it really is one of the bellweathers of the economy. Okay, a big week ahead and that's thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look at Tesla shares right now, sliding after the EV maker slash the price of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China. The stock is down nearly 5% in the session. This coming after must comments during last week's Tesla earnings call saying there are elements of a recession in China. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, pros, supermanian, pros. This has a lot of people saying, look, is he trying to start price war essentially in the EV market or the biggest EV market? Yeah, I mean, I think you see the Model 3 coming down by 5% Model Y base level by almost 9%. So there is concern there that demand is slowing Musk, as he said, is much on the call. It's that is related to the property market, but that sort of trickles on everywhere. So analysts are thinking that this could actually boost demand, but also could also lead to a price war. Other competitors like Leado, X-Pung, among others, could follow suit and they could actually do that with their pricing strategy. So I'm not surprised to see that. Also want to note that Electric has seen that Tesla is restarting the referral program. So if you buy a car through me through a referral link, you can actually get rewards points for stuff like free supercharging. You also have raffles to get a bulk buckle and free use of a car for you. So they're trying to like just basically try to get that demand back up there in China. You know, they had a record quarter of September, 80,000 sales or so, but I guess that's still not enough when you have like the Shanghai Gigafactory kind of increasing output and lead times coming down. So there needs to be a way to kind of get those cars out the door. What does that mean in terms of the revenue coming out of China if they have to lower the prices? I would imagine that would revenue be okay. I think revenue would be okay. This margin will begin impacted. If they're making more than 80,000 cars a month out of China, that's a serious demand. Maybe they'll start exporting more to other places like Europe, but for now in the Chinese local market, it seems like demand slowing down, competition heating up, B-Y-D, 200,000 cars sold last month. So that's a big part of that whole equation. Yeah, B-Y-D giving them big competition in China. Thanks so much for that, Frost. Well, shares of Meta are falling ahead of its quarterly results after Bank of America downgrade, the stock from buy to neutral. It is often the lows of the session still down about half a percent here. Analysts also lower the stock's price target from 196 to a share to $150, citing concerns about a decline in online ad spending. The B-Y-D now expects that to accelerate next year, with revenue growing at just 4 percent year on year, that's half of what the street is expecting. Analysts also saying that they are, in their words, incrementally more cautious on this content shift that we're seeing on Facebook and Instagram to reels this coming after those very disappointing snappers all last week. Well, coming up on the other side, we are staying with the taxoria's big tech reports allume. We're talking about Amazon, Apple and Meta all showing their hands in the coming days. How much of an issue is over investment in this struggling ad market in the hawkish bed? We're going to dive into all of those issues on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,19,2022-10-24 15:16:28
3938,"<|cs|><|translate|> WITH NO Well, it is shaping up to be a big week for the broader tech story with the likes of Apple, Amazon and Metta all reporting in the coming days. Until now, a big revenue miss for Snap and signs of a dire online ad market has been the major warning sign for the space. The NASEC has plummeted over 30% since the start of the year outpacing declines for the S&P. The sector has also been contending with what my next guest calls a COVID hangover because of tech over investment. Let's bring in Erica Klauer, a Jamison associate tech equity portfolio manager, a lot to get through to this week. But let's start by looking back to what happened last week. We saw the huge sell-off coming on the back of Snap that has accelerated concerns about a decline in online ad spend. How much of that are we going to see reflected, especially in Metta and Elphabet? Well, we talked a little bit about the fact that a lot of the advertising at SnapChat has basically been a result of share loss. I think relative share gainers will be companies like Google, like Facebook. Nevertheless, there is a lot more pressure in terms of justifying the price of advertising online that I think will persist throughout 2023. And so when you look at somebody like Elphabet, what we have learned, at least from the past few quarters, is that they are a little more diversified when it comes to this online ad spending. So obviously, it's not like Snap, or we're just talking about one particular app, you know, a specific market. Does that shield Elphabet for some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in a company like Snap? I think you're absolutely right. Google is much more diversified than a Snapchat is. And Samsung goes for Facebook as well. What about Amazon? They have made making a lot of big in roads, especially in the advertising space. That's right. I think Amazon has done a very, very good job with its advertising assets. And I expect that that division will continue to outperform and gain share. So how do you think investors should be looking at that? We'll sort of break down Apple separately, obviously, that there's a lot to get into there. But when you talk specifically about the stocks that are really affected by digital ads, and we're seeing a pullback in general, who's best positioned? Who do you stay away from? Well, I think overall spending will be somewhat pressured because there is a need right now to really look at all costs amongst all enterprises. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,20,2022-10-24 15:21:16
3939," Well, I think overall spending will be somewhat pressured because there is a need right now to really look at all costs amongst all enterprises. There is rampant inflation with regards to labor costs and also input costs. So clearly, people are going to be scrutinizing their advertising budgets more than ever. However, in that context, the companies that are really executing and gaining share would include Amazon, Google and Facebook. Let's talk about Apple. There's the obvious, numbers that we look for in terms of where their demand is on iPhones, how they're expanding in services. But there's a larger story that I think a lot of investors are looking at that puts Apple right in the middle. And that is supply chain movements. We were just talking about China and the concerns that persist around there. Apple has a big presence. They've been trying to move production into India away from China. And then there's this big tech controls crackdown that the Biden administration has put forward that does affect Apple and where they source their chips. Well, if we take a giant step back, what we're looking at this week is a cumulative 7 trillion amount and market value of companies reporting this week amongst the big tech players. The advertising companies are in one bucket and then of course, they're the hardware and software companies in the other bucket, including the likes of Apple. And what I would say about Apple is that the company is executing extremely well. But it is not immune to the the trends that you just mentioned. It took decades to basically consolidate all of their manufacturing in lower cost regions. That's being undone right now as the supply chain is being diversified. So ultimately, that is inflationary in its nature. And at the same time, we have a much more difficult demand environment where many people bought their smartphones. They bought their personal computers during COVID. So there's not that dramatic need that we've seen over the last three years to upgrade or even to attract the first time buyer. We can talk about the shift in where manufacturing is happening, where you source your supplies. What does that specifically mean in terms of inflationary? Are we looking at higher prices down the road? Is it going to be cushioned by the company just given the cash pile that they have? How do you see that being reflected in the coming quarters? Well, there are companies that are just masters of their supply chain. Apple would be the poster child for that. However, I think that when one is thinking about duplicate efforts to ensure no disruption to supply chain, that inherently means higher costs. And so the company will have to really assert its pricing power in order to offset those higher costs. I think that's going to be a story over the next couple of years. Still the strongest name, though, in the big tech space? Absolutely. I think Apple is showing very strong gains in market share. Even now with its dominant position, it's still outpacing its peers in terms of adoption. Eric, apply our Genescent Associates Technology Equity Portfolio Manager. It's good to talk to you today. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Well, one of the thories of 2022, not been only the hawkish bed and the occasional market meltdowns, but the lack of safe havens investors thought they could lean on. That's certainly the case with Bitcoin, which has spent much of the year following stocks. Bank of America's latest crypto note offers some help for Haven status, however, suggesting the possibility of price divergence, our chart of the day specifically takes a closer look at the Bitcoin gold correlation. Something we've talked about before. It chose a negative trend from March 2nd before eventually turning positive on September 5th. And it's been staying there as ever with Bitcoin. Things change quickly. So we're going to continue to watch the space. Well, coming up, diagnosing the future for class, we speak without going CEO Steve Ruskowski on a decade in the role of a record sending 2021.

3940," Naive Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. I'm going to be talking about a few hours into the trading week. I've been in the split picture emerging, although positive with the Dow, trying to build on those gains that we saw from last week, up about 260 points, the S&P 500 up 20, and then as I act, the only one that's down in the red, although slightly, of course, earnings, a big focus this week in terms of sectors that we're watching right now. Health care, one of the biggest gainers on the day. And of course, we're going to be talking about all those big tech earnings on tap this week. I'm going to be talking about my colleague, Anjali Kamlani, who is joined by a special guest, Anjali. That's right, if you go, thank you so much. We are joined now by the CEO of Questagnostic, Steve Rikskowski, really a legendary individual in the health care space. Over the last 10 years, at the helm of one of the most important health care companies. Steve, thank you so much for joining here us here today. Thanks for having me. I want to stir off with obviously the pandemic, one of the most unprecedented situations that any CEO has had to contend with. You, of course, seeing that demand on testing like never before. Tell us about it and how you got through it. Yeah, so it's been a busy two and a half years, Anjali. We started in the fall, excuse me on the spring of 2020, when we first realized that this pandemic would be here and, and really sink its teeth into us. And so in March of 2020, we actually first started to bring up our testing. And then we brought it up, not just in one laboratory, but throughout our whole system of laboratories. And we thought it would be capped within the year, but it extended itself into 21 and we continue to have substantial testing this year as well. So fortunately for us, we've responded to what we need to do from a testing perspective. And we're continuing to advance the science to provide serology test in other ways for us to start to understand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,22,2022-10-24 15:29:38
3941," and do from a testing perspective. And we're continuing to advance the science to provide serology testing in other ways for us to start to understand where people are in their protection for COVID going forward. Yeah, I wanna talk about that continuation. Do you feel like the company's at a place now where you can really continue to scale up and scale down as needed considering the fact that we might be facing future pandemics? Yes, we have now about 300,000 test capacity per day. We've been at a fraction of that for the last several weeks. We actually have seen the testing volume for what's referred to as PCR, the central lab testing capability for COVID come down. But we're prepared in the event that it starts to ramp up. They'll be able to bring on more tests. So we're not closing down that capacity, but we're preparing the event that it comes back out. Here, now I'm looking at the look back at the company 10 years now at the helm, talking about what the industry has been through. I mean, it's been really a push into consumer driven healthcare decisions. We're talking about a virtual care really on the horizon. So talk to me about how you've seen those changes and where you see a quest role in all of that. Yeah, it's been a remarkable decade. If you think about it, we put it place the Affordable Care Act. We've had substantial cuts in how we get paid by Medicare in this industry. And then finally, as we just spoke, we just came through the pandemic. And so it's been in three big changes within healthcare delivery. But through all that change, we've also seen emergence where when I joined 10 years ago, we said we're much more than a lab. What we do is empower better health with that inside we deliver every day for physicians and increasingly for consumers. And we also believe that the consumer is now playing a much bigger role in their healthcare. And so we brought up a capability a number of years ago to offer testing capability to consumers where they can go on and directly engage with quest diagnostics against the test they need. One of the other major milestones of the industry really went through was with Theranosaga and everything that came after the questions about testing. What do you think has been the biggest learning from that episode? And do you think that the industry's in a different place today? Yeah, you think about what that dialogue brought to this industry. It was a dialogue around the importance of testing. The reality is we're about 2% of the healthcare costs in this country. Well, we represent around 75% of the information but a clinician, a physician, a nurse, and an individual used to make the important next choice in healthcare. So very important portion of that information that's needed every day. And then secondly, what that period of time showed us is that we can test consumers in a much simpler working meaning way. And at quest diagnostics, we actually have brought up our patient service centers and we have around 2,200 of those. And many of those are now in retail-like settings. And we've actually started to partner, where retail partners like Walmart, where we have some of our patient service centers in their actual stores. And so the convenience of getting access to testing and the ability for you to directly order it has been a new capability. All that came out of that dialogue around the importance of testing and the need for it to be much more available to consumers. Another big issue in the healthcare industry today still is costs. I know that you've seen the conversation over the past several years. And you know right now the company's also doing something interesting when it comes to helping to balance out the cost of access to healthcare. Yes, we have actually a number of years ago, we said we need to do something about our healthcare cost for employees. We sell, I'm sure, about 60,000 people at Quest Diagnostic. So what we did is we put in place a different approach of managing our healthcare costs. We heard a physician with healthcare insurance background and we started step by step to see what we could do ourselves to bend the cost curve.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,23,2022-10-24 15:33:43
3942," and inching our health care costs, we heard a physician with health care insurance background, and we started step by step see what we could do ourselves to bend the cost curve. And fortunately, I'm pleased to tell you that we did bend the cost curve. And actually this year, what we just introduced in the fall, for 95% of our employees, there'll be no increase in their payment for their health care. For 5% of those employees, there will be a fee increase. And that's primarily for the highest paid people at Quest Agnostics. So real good progress of bending the cost curve for our own employees. And definitely a push into health equity. I've got to end with just a look back and everything that you've achieved and before Quest also working at Phillips, so you've really been in the health care industry for quite some time. What's next? Well, you know, I've got a long bucket list through my personal life, I've got four great grandchildren, two kids and a lovely wife. And so we're gonna spend more time personally. Well, professionally, I'll do something. I'm still thinking my way through that. I'm still actively managing Quest Agnostics as a CEO. I'll stay as the executive chair to the end of March of 23. And then we'll head to the next chapter of my life. Sounds good. Well, we'll have to leave it there. And hopefully this isn't the last we see of you. Quest Agnostics CEO, Steve Vrskowski. Thank you again for joining us today. All right, now thanks to Angelie as well for bringing us that interview. Well, coming up the revolving door, the UK gets its third Prime Minister in seven weeks as Rishi Sunack prepares to step into 10 Downing Street, strolling in UK bond like the sound of stability, but we'll come to the expect from the former chancellor.

3943," Well, taking a look now at British bonds, a three-year guilt rising alongside the sterling, as Rishi Sunak has said to become the next British Prime Minister. Sunak will become the first person of color to take up residence at number 10, with markets cheering expectations of less volatility. Yahoo, finances, Jared Blachery here to break it down. Less volatility, but the bar's pretty low, Jared. Hey, after the last seven weeks, six weeks. I don't think we should be slapping each other on the backs just yet, because we still have a lot of central bank actions to go. We're going to get to the BOJ in a second. We've got a big meeting this week, but let's take a look at the Wi-Fi interactive, where I am looking at the British Pound versus US dollars. Up means stronger pound, down means stronger dollar. This is a pretty ho hum day here. Now, a lot of this news, I think a lot of the news that was moved the market last week was really the resignation of trust. That has been largely priced in, but let me show you a year-to-date picture of the British Pound versus US dollar down 16%. Now, when I put some candlesticks, you can see the volatile price action probing these lower levels almost back to, I would say, back to parity, but I don't think it's ever been there. So that would be a first. Now, you take a look at what's happened with some of their markets like the footsie. That has been under pressure as well, but the bottom line is that the local markets, that is the pension system, will be ring-fenced by the local central bank, which happens to be the bank of England over there. That is going to happen. It's going to be local's first, and I think that policy is going to pervade around the world. These central bankers meet quite frequently. However, we obviously have different goals. Let's talk about Japan. We've always been following the Yen. We were just talking on Friday about a potential intervention. It came out after that they, they, they, they, BOJ did, in fact, intervene. The levels are not at where they were on Friday, but they're not that much higher. That's right. And we can see that it's on the Wi-Fi interactive again here. Now, this is a three-month view of the US dollar versus the Yen. So, higher prices here mean a stronger US dollar and weaker Yen. So, there is this big, outsized candle. These don't look like huge moves, but in currency worlds, these are huge, huge moves. And we saw this volatility get above 150 for the first time. And I don't know how many decades here. We saw a decline here based on the intervention. That is the Japanese authorities. We don't have official confirmation, but it was released by N.K. that they had intervened in the market. And they were likely doing this by selling US treasuries. All of this relates to the US market because if you're selling US treasuries, guess what? The 30 year in the US? Well, that is up to 2007 highs right now. And it's a feedback back loop. It's a vicious feedback loop that actually strengthens the US dollar. So, in the long run. So, my point is, without further intervention this week and the market is already discounting this, probably going to end up back at square one. So, back up to above 150. Yes. Yentervention. Is that what we're calling it? I'm just reading this from other sources. I thought it was pretty catchy. Yeah. Yen intervention. Yentervention. All right, thanks for that, Jared. Coming up a new era or more of the same, Xi Jinping takes the reins on the third term as China's leader, market reaction, anything but warm, but what about the politics? We're going to head to DC for reaction on that story of the day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,25,2022-10-24 15:42:27
3944," Well. Feet high shaped rotates over his chest and knees. Each of his legs with hers sticks together. Well, Chinese president Xi Jinping unveiling a new central committee over the weekend and securing an unprecedented third term as the Communist Party's general secretary. Meanwhile, the Ohio Senate race is getting tighter. We've got Yahoo Finance contributor. Kevin's really on top of all of the big stories for us on this Monday. Kevin, let's start with what's happening over in China. What's been the reaction from the White House? Well, look, I think policymakers in Washington, D.C. by partisan policymakers are really incredibly growing skeptical of exactly what Xi Jinping intends to do in the years ahead. Now, the question is, the biggest question, of course, remains about what will Xi Jinping's actions be on Taiwan? And how long will he wait? Should he want to invade the Democratic Island? Will he wait until the 100-year anniversary in 2049? Will he start to take aggressive action in the short term in the years ahead? And that's really the open-ended debate here in Washington, D.C. As well as what type of an approach he would take. Would he deploy tactics similarly to Hong Kong, or would he try to do a different route? But I was really incredibly struck by a bipartisan statement that came out from the leadership of the all-powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month, chaired, of course, by Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Jim Rish, who is a Republican from Idaho, in which they said, quote, a country truly committed to addressing the world security challenges does not threaten the war as she is doing to Taiwan. China is also providing metals and energy to prop up Russia's growth test war in Ukraine. Xi securing a third term will only continue this path of repression, economic coercion, and regional instability. The finances coming out of Congress are also striking. They have doubled their military assistance over the next five years to $10 billion. The initial request earlier this month was about $5.5 billion. So not just rhetoric coming from Washington, but a financial backing as well. Yeah, also got some interesting comments last week from the head of the U.S. Navy saying that he expects the timeline for some kind of invasion of Taiwan to take place in 2024. Let's shift gears to what we're watching here in the U.S. I counted 15 days until the midterms. You've been talking a lot about the Pennsylvania race, but though a high-oh-rays, a new pull out showing things are neck and neck between Tim Ryan and JD Vance. They're absolutely neck.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,26,2022-10-24 15:47:20
3945," talking a lot about the Pennsylvania race, but though Ohio race. A new pull out showing things are neck and neck between Tim Ryan and JD Vance. They're absolutely neck and neck and it's and China is actually playing in Ohio, Ohio, Ohio where you've got Tim Ryan a moderate, tender crack, a centrist, Democrat former congressman, former presidential candidate too, mind you. And he's really going on offense against JD Vance. He's a mega back candidate. He's JD Vance has also received financing from of course Peter Teal. And he has said to see an end to Jake Tapper just in prime time on Friday night that they that he is trying to position JD Vance as a China candidate who is, he was investing in China while criticizing China on the campaign trail. So it's interesting to see geopolitics play in the populist streak of the heartland and American politics. But if you look at the subject pole that just came out, it is neck and neck. JD Vance does have a slight edge, but still within the pole's margin of error, 47% to 45% with 7% of voters still on the side of it or inclined to choose another candidate, plus or minus 4% in the margin of error. So it's, you know, Ohio typically has been leaning more conservative in both presidential and midterm cycles. So if Tim Ryan were to pull this off, it would be the cause of issues like the economy in which he's making a more moderate type of democratic pitch. In contrast to someone like a John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, as you know, who's made a more progressive economic pitch. So it'll be interesting to see what resonates with voters. Even as we look ahead, we have to constantly look back because of the former president, Donald Trump. He's still got his legal issues, his organizations, a fraud trial, tax fraud trial, starting this week. What's the very latest that you're watching on that front? Well, you know, Liz Cheney, who is, of course, one of the leaders of the January 6th committee, and she spoke to Meet the Press in a very stoic, sobering interview yesterday over the weekend, rather. And she said that it would be a quote-unquote disaster for Trump. Should he, for the Republican Party, should Trump be the nominee in 2024? Now, why does this matter? Now, whether or not you think that Liz Cheney has any chance to become president in 2024 to be the standard bearer for the party, she has stake her claim for the never-Trump movement. And she becomes ultimately the defacto leader of the never-Trump crowd. The conservatives who felt left out of the MAGA brand of conservative politics. So that has data implications, it has fundraising implications. And it also has short-term implications in mid-November. Remember, the January 6th committee has subpoenaed former president Trump to hand over documents and to testify under oath before the committee. Whether or not Trump cooperates with that, we don't know. But she insists, Liz Cheney insists that this will not be her words comparing it to the first presidential debate back in the last cycle between Biden and Trump. And that she would hope that this would be an opportunity for the record to set the record straight, but also to get some more information about what happened on January 6th. Finally, Kevin, we were talking this morning that you always like to remind us you're from Philly. I'm surprised you know, you have a Yahoo Finance sign, not the Philly sign. Now that they're headed to the world, Derek. Don't tempt me, because look what I do now right next to my good-bye chart. This has been Franklin, he is a famous Philadelphia. I mean, how great is it? I was talking to my mom and dad earlier this morning. I had a conference call with them. And I had a conference call with your parents. For ages after the gym, right? How great is it to be a Philadelphia and I grow right outside the city of Delco? But I mean, it's the greatest city we invented America. The birds are undefeated. And the Philadelphia Phillies are going to the World Series. I feel like a mummer on a Monday. I had 10 comfortable words. How it's just, you know, it's good news for the city of Brotherly Love. And we could all use some fun and we could all use some good news. And I'm just, you know, it's a great day. It's a great Monday. It's a great story. I think an amazing story. I'm going to be rooting for the Phillies. I'm still heartbroken about my Dodgers, but I'm rooting for the Phillies. Because nobody wants the Astros to win again, right? No. Let me tell you that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,27,2022-10-24 15:51:09
3946," I'm gonna be rooting for the Philly. I'm still heartbroken about my Dodgers, but I'm rooting for the Philly's because nobody wants the Astros to win again, right? No, but let me tell you this. I couldn't go to the Philadelphia Eagle Super Bowl parade because there was a partial government shutdown and I had to cover it. So let me tell you, if the, I did go to the parade when the Philly's won the World Series the last time. And you know, I love the parade. So maybe I'll get to go to a World Series parade where like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York too. I just thought I had a good parade too. All right, we're gonna all be rooting on your behalf. Kevin is always good to talk to you. Good start to the week. Kevin's really Yadavu Finance contributor. Now let's take a quick detour and turn to the world of rodents. Yes, rats are being trained to be sent into earthquake and natural disaster debris, wearing tiny, I take back facts. This is what the producers do to make me laugh by the way. To help first responder search for survivors in disaster zones. The project is led by Belgian nonprofit API Po, which is based in Tanzania. The program is currently training African giant pouched rats to locate targets, pull a switch on their B-Burr, on their backpack to signal a target is found and then return to base where they're rewarded with a treat. The nonprofit has been training dogs and rats for search and rescue for over a decade. I get a lot of comments on this one, but I'll just keep them to myself. All right, coming up on the other side, swing and it is. Yes, what Kevin talked about, the Philly is making their first playoffs since we should say World Series in France in 2011, but if the win, if they win, history says it should also mean a recession is on the way. That's if you believe in all this stuff. Does Yadavu Finance is Josh Schaefer believe that? He's gonna give us his take on the other side. This is the goal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,28,2022-10-24 15:55:52
3947," Well the Philadelphia Phillies continue their journey towards a World Series Championship after beating the San Diego Padres 4-3 in game 5 of the NL Championship Series. The Philadelphia Phillies World Series win followed by the followed by an economic downturn. I mean I don't know if it's a superstition, is it really rude to be on it? We should probably start with the caveat that these indicators are really just kind of fun. It's like when we talk about the Super Bowl indicator every year, which by the way has been proven wrong this year. Normally when an NFC team wins the market goes up, that clearly hasn't happened. So that gives you an idea of how these sports indicators work. The Phillies won. So the Phillies have only won two World Series Akeko. 2008 and 1980 for most of our viewers that listen to us talk about the downturn that we might be experiencing or might not be those years stick out. But the one thing that sticks out to me when you look at this chart specifically too, so you can see when the Phillies win, the market has gone way down. But when they won in 2008, the market was down nearly 40% that year, but it actually went up 23% the next year because 2008 was kind of midway to almost the end of the crisis as far as what we saw in the markets. 1980 was a little bit different. 1980 the market was up that year and then went down about 10% next year. So even using this indicator, I don't really know if you can come up with a clear, well, it always goes up the year after because it was actually different. One thing it did, it was a sign of was a recession. So maybe instead of looking at two quarters of down GDP, we can just watch the Phillies. Is this the reason to root against the Phillies? I mean, we don't really know. I think America is going to be rooting for the Phillies either way. Yes, I think so because of the Astros history cheating. But let's talk about how the MLB sees this because going into the playoffs, it was the Yankees, Aaron Judges, home run record, the Dodgers, their regular season record. And here we are at the end of the season talking about the Astros and Phillies. Not major markets. They do have followings, but what's the expectation on ratings there? Yeah, it's going to be interesting. I think one thing that sticks out to me is game one is Friday night. This Friday night, which is a good night for sports right now. You're going to have the NBA and NHL, but you're not going to have big football. And they avoid Sundays throughout the whole World Series schedule, which is really huge. You just don't want to play with the NFL. You're not going to win. I think the Phillies are a fun narrative. And Mike, you said a lot of people because of the Astros cheating scandal want to root against them. This Phillies team is fun. They dance after they win. The crowd goes crazy. They really weren't supposed to be in the playoffs. So it's a fun narrative from a star power perspective though. I don't know. So we'll have to see. Feels like the Phillies have momentum on their side. They weren't expected to be here. They're right here. I love the momentum pick. I grew up in Red Sox fans, so I buy into that. We're both going to pick the Phillies. I'm not going to keep it a secret. All right. Thanks so much for that, Josh. Final check of the markets here. We've been watching the NASXY. The only one in the red here, but take a look at that. It's in the green now. Up 32 points. The Dow accelerating its games here. Up about 390 points. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here on Yahoo Finance live. Keep it right here. It's here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,29,2022-10-24 15:59:57
3948," Joke In the third quarter, as travel and leisure continues, its recovery from COVID-19. American Airlines for one boosting premium seats by 60 percent on strong demand. So what are the best names to own headed into next year? Joining us now, Connor Cunningham, Melius, research director. Connor, good to see you as always. Let's start American Airlines because they're focused on boosting premium seats. Certainly, I would argue when viral online, what is the earnings impact that company from doing that? Yeah, so premium seating has been a big deal for quite some time. Airlines have been, if you look historically, there hasn't been a lot of new mainline economy seats being added to the system. It's mostly been the growth has been through premium seating. So this has been a trend, a mega trend that I would say throughout the industry for quite some time that's been occurring. So yeah, American getting rid of first class and adding more business seats is really they're just trying to add products that people are willing to purchase at the end of the day. So what a big trend again that I think airlines have learned from the past is that historically they've done a really bad job of actually selling their seats from a premium standpoint. So now they're actually doing a much better job of displaying it to folks making the price less shocking when you're looking at them and more reasonable for the common person to kind of look at him potentially by. So yeah, it's been a big trend. Something that we expect to continue, huge benefits for Delta United, American on some level as we look out into the future. And Connor, this is on outsized leisure travel. When do you expect corporate travel to come back in full of force? Yeah, so corporate travel has grinded up for quite some time now. You know, there's been a lot of in spills over the demise of corporate travel zoom being something that people talk a lot about all the time. But corporate travel is about 80% recovered from a volume standpoint right now. The yields themselves are doing pretty well too. So you know, where it's a steady grind higher our expectation is that in the fourth quarter there won't be another big step up. That's going to be more of a 20, 23 event. So we still continue to believe there will be a full recovery. It's just going to look a lot different. We hear a lot about these blended itineraries that people are doing. So please your conditional travel days of uncorporate. That's moving more to untraditional days, which is de-risking a lot of the issues that some of the islands have seen throughout the week. Connor, how do these stocks perform in a recession next year? The million dollar question. So yeah, recessions typically aren't great for the islands. But what I would say is that, you know, the airlines went through hell and back and now we're kind of getting through it. And we're not still fully recovered to traditionally what the airlines do is there percentage of GDP that they want to be in the revenue standpoint. So they would do that they've already made the adjustments. What I would say is that a lot of the airlines still aren't back to 2019 capacity. So if that we do hit a major recession and demand does ease, we could see them just not add the seats back. And so again, it's all about them commanding more pricing power and whatnot. What we're going to do is the best job that they possibly can from trying to match supply and demand. So again, they wouldn't necessarily add back to capacity. So do I expect the airlines to trade really well in an environment like that? I think they'll be choppy at that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,30,2022-10-24 16:04:32
3949," job that they possibly can from from from trying to match the plan to man. So again, it's they wouldn't necessarily add back the capacity. So do I expect the airlines to trade really well in an environment like that? I think they'll be choppy at that first until the adjustments are made. But they've been learning a lot and moving very quickly from that standpoint historically. So you know, I am somewhat optimistic. There is an overarching trend though. People are are still willing to spend money and they're spending more on services and experiences than they are on, you know, a couch. So, that that trend is still very much in their favor right now. So from what we can see, things still remain pretty good. Conor, that is why I upgraded my couch. So I am one of the consumers that is already not taking as much of the pricing increases from airlines. Do you believe that there's a threshold where we'll see more of a trend where consumers are pushing back on pricing? Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. We haven't seen it yet. I mean, what I would say is that they're they're really the market right now from from from from a supply standpoint is still super limited and going to be limited through of next year. And so, you know, traditionally, air traffic has kind of grown at two times GDP and capacities generally cut the cut pace. Airlines really haven't been able to add back anything for quite some time. So we're still trying to catch up. So there's still massive supply demand and balance and people are still willing to pay up for for those pairs. You know, there still will be deals to be made that be had in like the off peak time frames if you're willing to be flexible. But, you know, the if you're if you're looking to book for Thanksgiving, like we would suggest doing it now if you haven't already, it's only going to get more expensive. Peaky days will will remain very very, you know, the pricing environment will remain very high there. So again, if you can be flexible, you may find some opportunities, but there hasn't been a pushback yet. We're not talking about massive fair increases here. So it's like, you know, when we're adding 20 bucks, so you're really going to just not go on your vacation for that. But when you haven't really been able to do so for the past couple of years. So that the the consumer's been willing to pay. We'll see if it stays that way. Connor, what industry is the biggest secondary winner with this type of travel demand? We've heard travel demand cited in the corporate card complex for American Express. We've heard it cited in the roaming from some of the major telecom providers as well. Who wins out when we see more of that traveling actually take place? Yeah, I mean, so you're just looking through the whole travel complex. So yeah, airlines are one benefit area of it. But you can start to look towards, you know, lodging and so on. You know, cruise lines have been very beat up. Leisure, they're very much leisure focused. They got their own issues, but you know, there's potential there is things start to normalize. But yeah, I mean lodgings would be another big winner. One difference between them and the airlines is that they can't move their capacity around. So if you have a hotel, you're not tearing it down. Airlines can move things in and out. So an RV right now, the big winners are the airlines. But over the long term, you know, people will then start to look towards the bookings of the world, OTAs. Those guys will also benefit from this from this massive trend. But right now where you want to be is on the corporate side and international side. You know, what we've seen during earnings is this is this shift from domestic to international driving the revenue benefits. So that, you know, again, our view is that you should be looking more towards Delta's and the United to the world, which are the larger international corporate focused airlines out there. Within that answer, however, Connor, you did remind me of my second reason that I upgraded my couch, which is because I'm not getting on a cruise. Connor, cunning him. Marius research director. Thanks so much. Joining us here today, I appreciate it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,31,2022-10-24 16:08:34
3950," you i before the bell and it's stock currently moving lower by about 5.6% as investors mold the report and weigh the impact of inflation on the wireless providers consumer business. I spoke to Verizon CEO Hans Vesper earlier about the quarter. Take a listen. I think we came out from the second quarter. We had some softness in our consumer business, especially on the wireless. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter, especially around new plants, new products, but also did some price adjustments and coming into the third quarter and now reporting that we can see some of that is really getting good effect. I mean we're growing 10% or wireless revenue or EBITA grew 3% or almost 3% to 12.2 billion dollars. So definitely the progress we put in place was actually working, but it's a lot more to do. We're a large company and we need to continue the hard work we're doing right now to continue to do the great cash generation we're doing. So that was the highlight of the quarter. So we saw also the prepaid market. We acquired a track phone last year which added a really good asset when it comes to being in the value segment. We had a new products in there, a new product called Total Wireless but Verizon. We also added home broadband to the prepaid market and overall our broadband had a really good quarter. 377,000 new broadband customers in the quarter across business and consumer. So that fixed wireless access business we're doing is really working. So a lot of things was working for us. We still are working on the consumer segment to be even stronger and we're going to take more actions. It's a very agile market when it comes to consumer segment at the moment. I want to talk a little bit more about that consumer segment as well Hansen and from your perspective when you think about what you'd said at the end of the second quarter, mid-summer, second half challenges you were kind of looking out into the future and saying that second half challenges you see them as short term. Is that still the case or do you believe that there's some facets of the softness in the consumer especially as they're paying more for necessities right now and the macroeconomic climate that you believe might protrude into 2023 or even beyond. It's a little bit mixed feelings actually. We have the highest quality custom base and the largest consumer base in the country. We see really good payment from our customers, consumers where we are actually better than pre-covid so we don't see anything there. We actually see the roaming when people are traveling abroad. That movement are equally big or higher than pre-covid. So a lot of things are moving as normal and are store traffic between Q2 to Q3. That increased with double digits. So people are actually doing movement. Then of course we all read what's happening in the macroeconomy with higher inflation and the interest rates coming up. So it's a little bit mixed but clearly we are in the fundamental product. Everybody needs mobility. Everybody needs to be connected. That's so important for us and even more important these days. So clearly there are mixed feeling. We think we have a great product, we have a great network and we are spanning all the consumer segments and then not forget our business side that has a really good quarter with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the in the business group but not only that. I did 200,000 new almost 200,000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,32,2022-10-24 16:12:46
3951," water with both growth. There are almost 6% in a wireless business in the business group, but not only that. Added 200,000 new, almost 200,000 new net-dads in the business segment. So it's a little bit mixed when you're reading the market and what we're seeing in our customer base. Certainly. I want to talk a little bit more about those network investments in a moment, but before that, we know that you're one of the largest partners with Apple in terms of the iPhone, the latest edition of this consumer device in the smartphone that comes out year after year. And within that, there's even been some of the reports around where the demand might be pulling back. Are you seeing that show up in your business at all right now? Now, when we come to the iPhone 14 launch, we have seen very normal volumes. But moreover, we actually made an exclusive deal with Apple, which we have done over a long time where Apple 1 for only limited is a new offering, where you have all the Apple services, Apple Plus, the gaming, etc. In one package together we are only limited, very good for us to get it with Apple. So now we're very normal. There's a little bit of mix, of course, which type of products our customers are taking, but in general, very normal levels of a launch of an iPhone. If you were coming back to the network infrastructure investments that you're making as well, if we were to see any kind of recessionary concerns really permeate over into the next year, what would that mean in terms of the moderation of the level of network investments that you might be making? And perhaps on the other end, where you're full steam ahead? I think that the last six, seven years we have the plan exactly how we're going to invest in the network. This is our peak year. We're going to do some somewhere between around 22 billion in Capex, that's our guidance. And that's one portion is our business as usual. And then the other is that the new spectrum we bought last year is actually coming to execution right now, and we're doing that as fast as we can. And next year that will come down. But we have invested in fiber, we're investing in the C band, the spectrum we bought, we're going to pass 200 million pop in the first quarter on our C band. And the important with the C band, that's a five-despictrum that we're using. We see good growth on that. So we launch a market with the C band, we see mobility, business growing, we see fixed-wise access growing. And for the viewers, important, we bought that spectrum, but we get it all the time as the satellite companies are releasing it. And the last piece of that spectrum we will get at the end of 2023. But basically, it's nationwide 160 megahertz, which is a lot of spectrum. And we're only deploying pieces of it right now. But by year and 2023, we'll have all. So we have a clear process of how we implement and execute in our network. And that's on number one capital priority as well. So we will do what is needed for the network. We already have the best network, and it's just getting better. So just lastly, while we have you here, I got a hustle to my finish here. But I'm taking a look at the stock price, investors clearly reaction to this morning's earnings report. And perhaps they may be paying attention to some of the churn in end users or subscribers. But they also may be paying close attention to the margins as related to some of the capex that's going to be set forth and continues to be earmarked to the tune of 2022 billion dollars. That's your gents mentioned. When do you believe either some of the churn will start to alleviate, and then on the other side, when you can start to adequately wind down perhaps some of the spending so that the margins aren't as compressed? So when it comes to our churn in the third quarter, that was expected. We took a deliberate decision in the second quarter to do price adjustment in certain consumer segments. And we knew that we would have a churn bubble. So that was sort of an expected and very deliberate decision we took. And it was important for us to also do that because our industry has not done price adjustments on wireless ever. So this was the time to do it. We did it for certain segments. So that will ease over over time. So I think that's a very important message. And when it comes to the capex, we have a clear plan. We will come back, of course, with exact guidance for 23. But we have a very clear plan how we are on the peak level of spending right now. And that will come down as we are spending as fast as we can and deploying the C band.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,33,2022-10-24 16:17:10

3953," in really miraculous things with AI. So that's the future. But right now, you're also kind of looking at this environment where even as we were looking at snaps, earnings, and really reading through where they're impacted as a result of operating system privacy changes that many social media companies have been hit by because of the changes that Apple had put forward. There is another OS that's out there. In fact, there are a few other ones. And one of the other major competing ones is the Android OS. Why is it that there has been more of an impact to the social media companies' derivative of privacy changes from the Apple operating system than from any privacy changes because there's also a privacy push within the Android OS as well? Well, I think all companies need to step back and the regulators doing this as well. And look at what privacy means, how to define it, and what we actually want and to get ready for it. And there's just a whole range of outcomes. This is a huge global social, political decision that we all have to make. And there's so many moving cards I'd love to predict it. But I would just say to all companies, you have to ready yourself for a large number of different regulatory outcomes. Really, the question is, we know what is possible with AI. What does society want us to do with it? And that is a very big decision that's happening right now. There's no one route. It depends on operating systems. It depends on policies. It depends on choices that consumers and companies make. And nobody knows what's going to happen. So you just have to be ready for a variety of outcomes. Marty, when the market gets a sense, the Fed is done raising rates for this cycle. What will that mean for the M&A market? Well, so I have somewhat infamous for not making timing predictions. And I think I don't make them because I'm terrible at them. And also causality is hard, like knowing this happens. And that's going to happen next. And predicting the timing of it, who nuts right there. There is M&A happening. There are in every economy, including the one that we currently have. There are difficult spots. And there are bright spots. Again, back to AI, if you're looking at financing and in acquisitions and combinations of all kinds, in that area of AI, that is booming, just like probably better than ever. And so there are bright spot screenshots, even now, in certain sectors. And AI is certainly one of them. Marty, we only got about 30 seconds left. But I'd love to know, especially as so many companies are making changes when it comes to diversity, equity, and inclusion, whether that be at the entry level, mid management, all the way up to the board. What is the step that a company can take right now in order to ensure that even in the midst of macroeconomic uncertainty, that they are retaining those values? Well, so the companies have the right values in that in general. I'm not going to make a blanket statement. But really, it comes down to what are you actually doing day to day in your recruitment and your filling the pipeline in understanding connected to managing your people? And so companies are doing a much better job at the entry level, though it's still hard, and reflecting the demographics of the cities and environments where they operate. Really, the hard part is as people to become more senior in their careers, how do we continue to make them want to be here as opposed to some other place, and how we actively manage their careers to mentorship and sponsorship? Those are the things that all companies need to be doing in a disciplined, process-oriented way every day through every market cycle.

3954," you you any technologies. But what could all this mean for the path forward in the semi-sector? Let's bring in Daniel Newman, his future on research principal analysts. We both have got either Edith Young, Grace Capital General partner here to break it all down for us. Edith, I want to start with you because I think it's worth noting an interesting set that you have put out here in terms of what this exactly means. When you look at it, China consumes more than 75 percent of the semiconductors globally, but produces only about 15 percent. We have heard so many reports since the administration came down with these tech controls about not just panic, but just full on reassessment happening. What are you hearing from those on the ground? I think right now what China is trying to s-axis is if the intent from the U.S. government is to make sure that China cannot even buy or produce or even maintain what does that mean? It actually could impact many, many industry. We're not just talking about computer or smartphone, EV. This all sort of industry actually really needs this chipset to continue to run. I don't think there is a conclusion yet, but what I'm worried about that if China really wants to be as aggressive as the U.S. and retaliate, there could be a lot of impact for all the other companies in the U.S. And I think this is beyond just impact in terms of revenue for Intel or Qualcomm or Nvidia or of course we need to watch out for TSMC, but if they retaliate in other industries, this is going to be disastrous. And we'll get to the impact on some of those companies in just a bit, but really follow up here, Edith, what's the capability of these Chinese companies to be able to be self-sufficient when you're talking about advanced chips? So for the fast few years, President Xi is trying very, very hard to make sure that China as a country can be independent from buying from Nvidia, Intel or Qualcomm. But I think personally, I think it's still very, very far away to get to that level. I don't think China is self-sufficient yet. And though, the TSMC, SMIC, it's sort of the TSMC for China, but they're still far, TSMC is still far ahead in terms of what is being produced locally. Daniel Zedith highlighted, I mean, these as in the companies in China are major customers for American chip designers, chip makers too. There's an interesting report that BCG put out a few years ago that said that full tech control, as in a complete ban, could lead to upwards of 40% drop in revenue for some of these big names in the US. How are you assessing that impact right now? Yeah, I think we got to look at the more broad economic...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,36,2022-10-24 16:30:05
3955," for some of these big names in the U.S. How are you assessing that impact right now? Yeah, I think we got to look at the more broad economic story of what's going on here. I think President Xi Jinping is, you know, been very declarative about the intention of China to be the leading designer and manufacturer of leading edge semiconductors. The U.S. has put a massive investments with the CHIPS Act to take more control of its own fate and its supply chain. We have a lot of microaggressions going on in the South China Sea. And right now, this is one of the things China is very dependent on U.S. intellectual property and engineering capabilities in order to manufacture these leading edge chips. So a lot of this is focused on things like AI, high performance computing, which are going to not only enable innovation in, you know, as our other guests said, in smartphones and EVs, but in biotechnology in, you know, financial services and money laundering and fraud and things that need a lot of compute power. And so the U.S. right now is looking at the opportunity to sort of control the fate of the development of leading edge technologies, chipsets. And of course, this puts strain on both sides. It puts strains on U.S. manufacturers and designers of semiconductors. It also puts strain on equipment makers because part of this ban is also the shipping of equipment, the export of equipment that China needs in order to build more leading edge capacity. So, you know, as I see it, it's a very interesting moment because it's not only macroeconomic, it's also about their economic policy and national defense and security. But if we're talking strictly, Daniel, what it means for businesses, I mean, if China consumes more than 75 percent of this, and that market is effectively blocked off, you know, if the Biden administration really does put these controls in place and cracks down, what does that mean for these companies in terms of revenue? Well, right now, it's only very specific chips. And everybody's been assessing this. It's not the whole, you know, it's not the whole portfolio of semiconductors. Folks, I've listened to, you know, Justin Wong at Nvidia, they're already accounting for what they think are going to be components of their portfolio and the impact that it might have on revenue. And of course, we've seen the early warnings coming out from these companies. There's certainly a chance that this could have a much bigger waterfall effect. But I think these companies have already looked at the situation, they're assessing it. And in this sort of tough macro and tough economic period, they're starting to put those warnings out about what it could mean. I'm not overly alarmed that it's going to be the whole portfolio of all chips, lagging ads that are used to manufacture our refrigerators and air conditioning systems. I think this is about leading the arms race for the next generation of technology in areas like supercomputing, high performance compute and artificial intelligence. Edith Young, race capital general partner and Daniel Newman, future and research principle and I'll appreciate both of you joining us today. Thanks so much for your time. Moving on to our top story of the hour. It is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,37,2022-10-24 16:34:35
3956," Moving on to our top story of the hour. It is all about snap and take a look at where shares are trading right now, down more than 30 percent following its mis-on-revenue estimates for the third quarter. The social media company citing continued deceleration of revenue growth as a result of ongoing challenges that include platform policy changes, macroeconomic headwinds, and increased competition. Joining us now for a snapshot of the path ahead for staff. We got Jason Healthstein, up in Heimer Managing Director in Head of Internet Research. Jason, you know, this certainly was not a great quarter, but this is a steep fall for this company. Shares are down more than 30 percent. How much of this do you think is overdone? Look, I think the challenges investors are kind of asking themselves, do they want to support this company longer term? I think one of the questions we get from investors is, you know, will they ever put ads in messaging? I think it's pretty well known. We all know we use all of us use messaging products, right? And we generally don't see ads in messaging products. And so, and a lot of this company's use case is at the messaging tool, right? I mean, they do then try to take that activity and get you to spend time using spotlight and using discover, but they're also seeing a ton of competition there from TikTok and others. So, when you couple together the 5 percent decline in U.S. time spent with kind of revenue that was below expectations and in terms of monthly trends that investors are having a really hard time to cybering, you know, I think you're having investors trying to side, do they want to underwrite the stock longer, the company longer term? Jason, there are two key issues that have really persisted from quarter to quarter this year. One is, of course, that the slowdown that we've seen in ad spending to the point you just made. Also, the other one is about this company being able to navigate these changes that have taken part as a result of the privacy guardrails that are now in place through Apple's IOS. I mean, these are not new problems that came up during this quarter. And I wonder if you think we've taken away anything more based on that earnings call yesterday about how much worse things are about to get particularly for SNAP? Yeah, we think kind of the Apple privacy is a good excuse but not the main reason. That really only affects for the most part app downloads or advertisers trying to write downloads. The bulk of SNAP chats advertising is brand advertising and that's what's been bouncing around kind of month to month in kind of an unpredictable way. So they're telling you that they expect their brand advertising to slow as they move through the quarter, right? And so that is the issue. And then they're also telling you that effectively competition is still a threat to time spent. And so this quarter, you saw impressions slowed. Not a ton. They were up 8% of the number of ads sold for SNAP. And the last quarter, then price spread was down 3% versus up 4% in the second quarter. And they're kind of telling you that they think those metrics will slow, right? Expecting to be a flat revenue growth in the back half. And it's not the fourth quarter. And it's not all currency. Conority was about two points of headwind. So there's definitely, I'd say more companies specific factors. Obviously, we'll know more next week when Alphabet and Meta report, but we don't expect kind of as bad of an outlook from Meta because they will be comparing against what was a challenging period last year. Well, and let's pick up on that point because when you look at the other social media stocks, they are following today in tandem with SNAP, not to the levels that we're seeing in terms of declines in the SNAP stock, but Alphabet, you mentioned Meta, Pinterest, another one that's been coming down as well. We've learned in the last quarter that this isn't SNAP, isn't always a bellweather, partly because these other names are a little more diversified. I mean, what's your expectation when you look at some of these names on the screen, who's best positioned to ride out the macro headwinds? Yeah, to your point, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized. Obviously, not as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,38,2022-10-24 16:38:50
3957," macro headwinds. Yeah, I mean to to your point, you know, we do think that the whole sector is getting penalized. Obviously not not as bad as a snap is, but kind of down, you know, four or five, six percent depending on the company. We actually do like meta the best right now for playing digital advertising within large cap in front of the quarter, mostly because they already took their loans a year ago, right? So they were the most impacted by Apple's privacy changes. They call that a 10 percentage point kind of impact to them. They also benefited the most during the pandemic from the poll forward in e-commerce spending and e-commerce advertising and that has unwound as we as the economy is reopened. If you look at the monthly data on retail sales, e-commerce isn't growing any faster than overall retail sales. So that's kind of telling you that they're still kind of like a hangover there. And so we think as that starts to obey and you're easier calms, we think the setup is is pretty good for meta. And then the last thing is we are waiting for Apple to kind of update. It's called SCAD Network 4.0. It's the next technology tool to improve tracking of ads and performance data. And we think meta is the best position company to take advantage of that for their advertisers. So we are optimistic on meta in front of the quarter. Okay, well we're watching for those numbers when they come out next week. Jason Helstein, Oppenheimer, managing director and head of internet research. I appreciate the time. Thank you. Well, we are seeing crude setting to finish off what has been a very choppy week. His investors look ahead to earnings from the oil majors given growing, growing suppliers in places like Libyan recession fears though, question is where prices headed. For more on that, let's bring in Mohammed Darwaza. He's senior analyst of macro energy at energy aspects. I'm going to get to talk to you today. Let's start with the demand that we've been looking at over in China. Of course, we started off the week at the party congress that's now wrapping up and the expectation was maybe we'd get some signaling on weather. In fact, China was sort of back off on the zero COVID policy, which is led to a lot of concerns about the demand coming out of there. What do you see in terms of how things are likely to shape up in the next few months? Yeah, thank you for having me. I think you're absolutely right. There may be had been some expectations building up that post party congress China would start moving away from zero COVID. I think what has been clear is that actually a lot of these lockdowns have come into effect ahead of the party congress in anticipation or sort of expectation that policy will begin to shift over the next sort of three to six months. I think the market is now kind of caught up with the view that this is unlikely to change imminently, but I think going forward, there is an expectation that COVID rules are going to begin to be relaxed. China has been somewhat absent from the buying cycle, including markets over",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,39,2022-10-24 16:43:11
3958," There is an expectation that COVID rules are going to begin to be relaxed. China has been somewhat absent from the buying cycle, including markets over the past year or so. And I think once China does come back, this is going to be a certainly a bullish factor. The next marker, a lot of investors certainly looking ahead to, is in December, when we see those sanctions come down on Russian oil, we're looking at where prices are tracking today. It certainly looks like at least some of those recession fears have subsided a little. How are you looking at where things are right now for talking Brent Critt at 9288 in the context of what's to come? Yeah, absolutely. I think obviously a lot of uncertainty going into your end. And this is kind of cast a sort of a cloud over the market. The EU embargo on Russian crude and products that set to come in in December of this year and in February of next year. I think ultimately will have a significant impact on Russian production. We expect Russian production to drop by an average of about a million barrels a day sort of by the end of Q1 of next year. More generally, I think prices will be kept going forward because of demand fears, because of concerns around recession. We are expecting quite a deep recession in Europe, a much shorter and a shallow one in the United States. And I think ultimately the extractor here is really China. So much of the concern in the oil markets have been shaped around the supply concern. You mentioned demand concern. Is that what's going to be driving prices going into your end? And what are some of those risks that we're overlooking? Yeah, I mean supply, I think the market does spend a lot of time looking at supply. Supply is constrained. This is a structural issue. I think people are coming around to that view. I think I would say it's a lot more sort of divergence in the market in terms of expectations. And in times of recession, we tend to see commodities and late cycle sort of sell off. And this is no different. But when we look at sort of the highs of the year, we have come off and we're about 20-ish percent from this year's highs. OK. We'll be watching a lot of people watching to see where those prices track. Mohamed Darwaza, senior analyst of macroenergy at energy aspects. big and high quality segments. you you today. We are now in the United States. It's great to see you, so I think we're all trying to make sense of the gains that we're seeing today and comparing that to the losses that we've seen really since the start of the year, the SMP still off just around 21% you're today, what's your assessment of where we stand today? I think optimism is just too strong here because the Fed has to reign in inflation and they are very far from having done that. So they still have a long way to go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,40,2022-10-24 16:47:24
3959," So the fact has to reign in inflation, and they are very far from having done that. So they still have a long way to go, and those higher interest rates are certainly going to hit earnings in the first, second, and third quarter of next year. And estimates will have to come down accordingly. And if you put 15 multiple unto those adjusted earnings, I don't really see the market much about 3,000 on the S&P. So how much further do you think the markets have to fall, Thomas? I think that it's going to get close to 3,000. So that's 10 to 20% lower from here. Thomas, what do you make of the moves that the Fed has made so far? Because there's lots of debate about how far the Fed has gone. If there is that risk, that the Fed is going to overshoot. Do you think they've been too aggressive up to this point? I don't think they have been too aggressive. Maybe they'll be aggressive in the future. But so far, look, the economy really hasn't slowed down much as a result of these rate increases. And they really want to dampen down retail consumer demand. And once they succeed in doing that, then inflation will slow down. And what that will show up in the sales figures for the big tech companies and most consumer rich companies. So the Fed president, Mary Daly, San Francisco, really rallied the markets. How did you hear these comments? It's time to start talking about stepping down. The time has now to start planning for stepping down. I think that is the wrong message. I think the Fed has to send the message that we're going to stamp out in place no matter what. And if they are in a better position, if they can scare the market into easing up on spending rather than having to force them to ease upon it. So I don't think the Fed is very happy right now. And Thomas, and with all of that in mind, the fact that you're saying that the S&P could fall to 3,000, I'm curious what you're seeing from your customers, from the retail investor perspective. What are they doing at a time when there's so much uncertainty in the market? So our core customers who are basically professional traders who work on the trading desks of many of the large investment banks around the world. And they have stayed portfolio early on this year. And as the market has been polling, they just recently started to cover those hedges. They're slowly, unfortunately, the retail investors got really hurt. And they are not the sidelines. As far as the market going from here, it's generally accepted by the professional traders. The market, as I said, has another 10% to 20% to go down. But it is impossible to pick a button. And so they have to pick a range of prices at which they gradually get back into the market using right interactive boom brokers as all kinds of algorithms that you can set up to buy, scale down, and in falling prices or sales fail up in a range of rising prices. So yeah. So based on the volume of TD Ameritrade and Charles Swab, the Wall Street Journal headline reads, time for day traders to go back to their day jobs. Overall, do you agree with that assessment? And when do you think they come back? Well, I agree with the assessment day traders. Yes. Day traders. Ameritrade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,41,2022-10-24 16:51:40
3960," Well, I agree with the assessment day traders. Yes. Yeah. Day traders. I mean, look, day traders don't do better or worse in an upmarket versus in a downmarket. So day traders are just there to try to get the swing of things. And the ones that cannot make a living, of course, they have to move at the age of. But much of these day trading is now migrated over to the options markets, where you can easily set up option spreads, like buying one strike selling another, where your risk and profit is limited. But you can take advantage of shorter moves without having to take too much of a risk. So I think that the conventional day traders has moved from the stock market to the option markets. And Thomas, as they take a look at your most recent earnings report, obviously, a beat there. The street rewarded the stock. We saw some appetite for the stock as a result of those earnings. Just what's your assessment of your business at this point during the current quarter? And what does it look like as we look ahead to 2023? So our business looks pretty good, because we have more and more larger professional customers, like Edge Funds coming onto our platform. And that is very helpful. So we have spent several decades automating everything in the business so we can offer our services very, very inexpensively. And so we're finally getting the benefit of it, because people are recognizing that IBKR is the platform to go to. And so we're finally getting the benefit of the stock market. Largely, we perceive on the perception that Mary Daly San Francisco Fed President's comments were dovish. What do you make of the rally? Well, it's welcome, certainly. And I think that a lot of my participants that have had a lot of challenging days. And so a day like today is certainly a good relief. But if we look at more toward the median picture, we still have, as your previous guests said, a lot of inflation pressures. The Fed still has a lot of work to do. And interest rates are still rising. So we're not putting all that much stock into this one day, but it's certainly welcome. And we'll take it. Well, Yungy, what do you make then of the next couple of weeks, the next couple of months, in terms of the fact that the Fed's going to stay more aggressive. So 75 basis point height seems like a short thing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,42,2022-10-24 16:56:14
3961, What do you make then of the next couple of weeks and next couple of months in terms of the fact that the feds going to stay more aggressive the 75 base is point high seems like a short thing at this point at the next meeting. Is that going to trigger sell off? I think the 75 basis point is pretty much baked in and the big discussion now is on December meeting whether it'll be 50 or 75 basis point. But I think if we take a step back the markets in a bit of a catch 22 because if we want earnings to stay stable given the cost that companies are facing now both wage pressures other input costs as well for them to pass those costs on is what's necessary for earnings to stay stable and passing those costs on mean inflation. And that means the fed has to continue to be aggressive. So we're in this push and pull dynamic here that's not easy to get out of until we get much better inflation readings. Interesting huge week of earnings next week but in the rear view mirror what's the lesson the the maddick lesson that you've seen and earnings so far in Q3. Well expectations came down a lot I think that's the that's the important thing to remember earnings expectations if you strip out the energy sector they went from about positive 6% back in July for this quarter earnings all the way down I think negative 3% and so once you lower the bar that much it does set up an environment where it's it's a lot easier to beat earnings a lot easier to have relief rallies. So the problem is when we go into Q4 if we continue to get down grades and lower earnings estimates will go through the same pattern that we went through leading up to this quarter which is a challenging environment so I think the themes are it's it's there's some stability companies are finding ways to manage costs to pass costs on but as your previous guest said there's still a lot of headwinds that remain and this is going to play out over multiple quarters not just a couple months. So what's that in mind that what should investors be doing at this point. There are a few areas that we like and that's a great question we certainly do like a value as a long term play even small cat value where valuations are certain look more attractive and we're actually looking more favorably on fixed income then we have in a very long time I think it's gone from an environment where we had a few years ago and it was Tina there is no alternative to what I'm calling now is Tara there's a real alternative and that real alternative is in the fixed income market you can get 4% on a two year about 4 and a half percent on a two year treasury you can get over 6% and triple be corporates you can get it around 9% almost 9% high yield corporates those are starting to look pretty attractive here so the fixed income market is going to be getting more and more attention as these interest rates continue to rise. Young you has the path narrowed to a soft landing. There is still path to a soft landing we do want to emphasize that that's still our base case a soft landing but that path is narrowing as interest rates continue to rise and rise sharply as a trajectory for inflation continues to look like it's going to be quite a sticky path ahead and as global factors and geopolitical factors continue to present problems that path is starting to narrow. But on the positive side we do want to reiterate that job market is very strong consumer spending should have a floor under it given the strength of the job market and so there is a path ahead that can lead to a soft landing but it becomes challenge as interest rates continue to rise. I guess it depends on which measure looking at headline or core but I don't think the challenge is getting from say 6% 7% inflation down to 3 3 and a half percent inflation that's not the challenge I think that's reasonably achievable I think the challenge of the feds going to have is getting from 3 3 and a half percent down to 2% and that last mile of inflation is really going to be a sticking point because the tightness of the labor market and the other inflation and pressures supply chain pressures ensuring you name it I think those that environment speaks to a situation where getting down to 2% is very difficult.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,43,2022-10-24 17:00:26
3962," pressures, ensuring you name it, I think those that environment speaks to a situation we're getting down to 2% is very difficult. So if the Fed sticks to that target, I think there's going to be a considerable amount more work to do. But yeah, being halved in six months seems reasonable. And then of course the debate out there is whether or not even has to get to 2% in order for the Fed to think that the job is completely well. Young Yuma, always great to have you. Thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Thank you, Sean. Thanks, Dave. In this episode of influencers, venture capitalists and domain money CEO, Adam Dell. You can invest today in the banking system of tomorrow. And that's a very exciting investment opportunity for retail investors. If you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that feels to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. You know, I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and could be more proud of my brother, Boyd, he's done. Hello, everyone. And welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sherwer and welcome to our guest, Adam Dell venture capitalists and the founder and CEO of a new trading platform domain money. Adam, great to see you. Good to see you, Andy. Thanks for having me. I want to ask you all about domain money. But first of all, I've got to ask you about the crazy markets this year, both in crypto and in equities. What the heck is going on? Well, market volatility is one of the things that is inherent in our market, right? Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital into a discrete number of assets, you're going to have significant swings. As Warren Buffett likes to say, the market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in long term. And as I look at the long term trends of some of the free cash flows, sources that are being spit out of some of the larger tech names, I'm quite bullish on their prospects going forward. And as it relates to cryptocurrencies, where we're focused, I look at the fundamental underlying components of blockchain technologies and their contribution to our financial markets, less from a speculative standpoint and more from a core market function, a core financial function. If you look at, say, for example, Visa, Visa moved about $10 trillion worth of transaction volume around the planet last year. Last year, Ethereum alone moved 11 trillion. And so that just gives you a sense of the scale of the impact of these technologies and what impact they will have on our broader economy. I'll give you another example. Money markets. A few years ago, the number of dollars involved in DeFi, money market protocols was less than a billion. That's a 2018 stat. This year, it's over 200 billion. And so the growth of the financial utility of these underlying technologies is undeniable. And as they become more widely adopted in commercial use cases, again, unrelated to speculation, I think you're going to see a significant growth in real revenue and real cash flow coming out of these technologies. Yeah, I hear you. And I want to ask you more about those technologies, but just sort of again, back to the macro environment, because, say, first of all, with the tech stocks, you know, they've just been such winners in so many ways in our economy. But the driver here right now is higher interest rates. Does that concern you? Well, I mean, you know, interest rates have been so low for so long that there's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,44,2022-10-24 17:04:42
3963," interest rates? Does that concern you? Well, I mean, you know, interest rates have been so low for so long that there's a whole generation of investors out there and market analysts who believe that this is the norm. And obviously on a historical basis, interest rates don't stay this low. And so I think, you know, given, you know, the true cost of capital and the fiscal responsibility that is incumbent upon responsible central banks to employ, interest rates inevitably need to go up over the long term. And with regard to cryptocurrencies, blockchain aside, people are talking about Bitcoin and they've sort of positioned it, Bitcoin and Ethereum, other cryptocurrencies as either a hedge or not correlated to equities. But right now, it looks like those currencies are correlated to equities. What's your take on that? Yeah, I think that is a reflection of the maturity that the crypto markets are going through. You know, these assets are now more broadly held across the larger institutional base. They're now held across a larger retail base. And so downward pressure in the macro market invariably will impact crypto as well. All right, let's switch over to domain money. Your new company is it pretty new and what is it? How old is it? So we launched today on January 25th. So we have thousands of customers on the platform today. It is a robust, sophisticated investment solution for both stocks and crypto. We provide a number of differentiated features that we think distinguish us in the market. Achief among them is our signal product, which goes really deep down the data rabbit hole around the underlying fundamentals associated with these crypto assets. I'll give you a few examples. We analyze the Twitter firehose as well as other social channels. And we provide a proprietary social sentiment score where we basically provide positive, neutral, negative ratings on the social sentiment of underlying assets. Another thing we do is we track the flow of funds on exchanges. So tracking the on chain and off chain activity of underlying crypto assets, which is indicative of sentiment and price volatility. A third thing we do is we track project health. We look at the overall quality of the management team, the number of GitHub submissions. And we present all of these insights to retail investors in a very consumable and easy to understand way. So those are some of the things that we are doing at domain that are unique. What about the timing of this all Adam? I mean, with the Fed, you know, probably raising rates a number of times this year, we were in this incredible bull market, particularly during COVID, where there was all those stimulus checks coming into people's pockets and then they were going out to broker dealers and spending it. Are you heading into sort of a wind coming in your face? Yeah, well, I mean, short term market swings are not really the thing that we pay a lot of attention to. We spend much more of our focus on the long term trajectory of these assets. And as I mentioned, you know, there are some incredibly powerful forces that are driving the global cash flow out of a number of the investment projects, the investment classes that we're looking at, particularly as it relates to DeFi protocols. And so we're very encouraged by the underlying trends that we see. You know, a lot of people look at the price of Bitcoin or the price of any given crypto asset over the last couple of weeks and say, gee, this was a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,45,2022-10-24 17:09:03
3964," trying trends that we see. You know, a lot of people look at the price of Bitcoin or the price of any given crypto asset over the last couple of weeks and say, gee, this isn't really good. I look at something very different, which is that a couple of years ago there was virtually no transaction volume moving around the world to empower NFT transactions. Last year, it was 23 billion. Okay. Less, a few years ago, less than a billion in D5 volume, last year, 200 billion. You know, 11 trillion in transaction volume on Ethereum. These are profound trends that are not going away just because of the short-term volatility in the financial markets. And speaking of those profound trends, Adam, and you mentioned, you worked at Goldman, you mentioned Visa, what does your take on these legacy institutions? Are they going to get consumed by these trends? Or are they going to co-opt them? I'm everyone I always talk about Visa and MasterCard or Dead because of electronic payments. Of course, they benefited like crazy. But now there are questions about those companies, for instance. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,46,2022-10-24 17:13:49
3965," I always talk OVISA and MasterCard are dead because of electronic payments. And of course, they benefited like crazy. But now there are questions about those companies, for instance. Yeah. Well, we've been honored that we were selected by MasterCard to be part of their Smart Path program. What I've seen from the Visa and the MasterCards of the world is they've really wrapped their tentacles around anything and everything related to blockchain technologies because they, like many smart investors, see the opportunity set and what it can mean for improving the efficiency of our banking plumbing. The bigger story, though, is what these technologies will do to allow consumers to both borrow and lend on their assets. That game is going to change profoundly because of blockchains and represents for consumers a real opportunity to make real yield on their assets or borrow at a much more market-driven rate rather than one available from their credit card or from their personal loan provider. We'd explain to us how that would work at them. Well, if you look on a number of the DeFi marketplaces where you can borrow and lend, you see rates that are much lower than what you would get from a credit card or from a personal loan provider out there in the market. But aren't those companies just trying to garner market shares and not a money-losing proposition or is the margin on crypto so much lower so that it is still profitable? Well, it's a true marketplace where rates are a function of what someone's willing to pay rather than a fair bit of regulatory constraints and controls that prevent true market rates from being accessible to anyone. The average consumer can't access a money market in the same way that an institutional investor can. And crypto represents an opportunity for those markets to be opened up to anyone. That was a metaphor I was looking for. That's great. And speaking of regulation, though, you provided me with a nice segue. The Biden administration is reportedly looking, as reportedly preparing, I should say, an executive order for release coming up soon that will outline a comprehensive government strategy on crypto. Is it a good idea for the White House to get directly involved here? Well, we welcome and invite regulation into this industry because it's an important step in its maturity. I point people to the fact that China's efforts to try to clamp down on this activity had virtually no impact on the overall value of the market or trading activity for that matter. And it just shows you that information wants to be free and markets want to be free. And so I think it's incumbent upon the United States as a leader, financial systems and financial markets to think through the policy decisions around what is a stable digital currency? How do we bring this nascent market into mainstream financial functions while at the same time protecting investors from the things that are scary and may not be as above board about this industry? And obviously in any new industry, those players emerge. Andy, you and I remember the early.com period where there were hundreds of companies many going public without clear business model or any line of sight to positive cash flow. And yet despite all of that noise, an enormously valuable set of companies emerged that redefined the very fabric of our economy. And the same dynamic will exist with blockchain and crypto. We're in the middle of a Cambrian explosion of diverse projects and initiatives that are being tackled by engineers using these technologies.

3966," Act domain money. We've worked hard to ensure that we are following the letter of the laws relates to regulation because we want to represent this industry as it matures, rather than being part of the fringes of the wild west of the industry. Right. My understanding, Adam, is that you said, quote, the notion that individuals are rational actors is a false one. They're emotional animals and they make financial decisions based on emotion. So is that true? OK, good. Glad we got that right. To trading platforms like yours, though, then have an obligation to protect users from themselves. Well, you know, I believe it's our obligation to inform the consumer and provide them with as much information as we can to educate them about making a rational investment choices. You know, we really stress on our platform education, transparency and time tested investment strategies. So we talk a lot about dollar cost averaging. We talk a lot about portfolio theory. We talk about a lot about market fundamentals. What is the market size of this technology? What is the product market fit? What is the management team? What is the business model? And what is the viability of that business model over time, rather than, you know, things that are meme and momentum driven. And so while I can't protect, you know, individuals from making bad decisions, I can help inform them. And so our goal is to is to achieve that for investors. I want to ask you about wealth inequality and financial services because of course, the wealthiest Americans still own the vast majority of equities. And it's probably true about crypto, although I'm not really informed. I'm just guessing maybe you know the answer to that as well. How do we address that? Is that anything that concerns you, Adam? Well, the most interesting opportunity for blockchain technologies is opening up of markets to a broader set of our members of society that don't have fair access to a financial relationship that allows them to live their lives, borrowing money, earning interest on deposits. Those core components of our financial system are available to people who have bank accounts, who have credit scores. And blockchains operate differently. They don't require there to be trust between the two parties to a transaction. And so they, as I mentioned earlier, represent an opportunity to open up those markets to a broader segment of our society and to make available to individuals who have a few dollars, a fairer interest rate, a real yield on their savings, which they might not otherwise have access to. I mean, if you're a merchant in Taiwan and you have savings, how do you get yield on those savings? If you're a doctor in Nebraska and you have savings in your bank account, they're paying you 0.06%. That's not a market rate in terms of interest on your money. And blockchains represent an opportunity to open those up to fair market rates and real market rates for each one of those individuals. Does that mean bad things for the legacy banks? I believe that the legacy banks are smart enough to acquire and partner and evolve their business models over time to embrace the changing nature of how financial entities make money. If you look at banking over the last 10, 15 years, it's been, it's very clear what's happened with the introduction of Dodd-Frank and other regulation, you know, interest rate competition has been introduced into the market and so the revenue that banks have made from interest has basically been cut in half. In response, what they've done is they've basically doubled their fees. And so they nickel and dime the consumer on these little things that, you know, nobody pays attention to, but add up over time. Eventually, that game is going to run out and true market-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,48,2022-10-24 17:22:06
3967," and the consumer on these little things that nobody pays attention to, but add up over time. Eventually that that game is going to run out and true market rates. What can you borrow for at what rate, what can you earn on your deposits at what rate. Those will be made available to consumers without the required on ramp associated with, you know, establishing a bank account. You will be able to access those rates through DeFi protocols powered by blockchain technologies. As we wrap things up here, I got to ask you some personal questions. And of course that means I got to ask you about Michael, your older brother Michael Dell CEO of Dell. What was it like growing up with Michael. And what about it do you think contributed to the success of both of you guys your household.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,49,2022-10-24 17:26:29
3968," Now what was it like growing up with Michael and what about it do you think contributed to the success of both of you guys your household. Well, my mom used to like to say that she had three boys and she left out food for two. Michael was always a young man in a hurry. He was always tinkering with something, doing something, working on something and he was pretty good at figuring things out. And so, you know, I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and couldn't be more proud of my brother and what he's done. Right. Okay. So, you're still working with him. I mean, you're in touch with him. You guys talk. What's your relationship like today? We talk a lot and I just saw him and he's doing well and working hard and enjoying his role as the CEO of Dell. Yeah, and it's just watching that kind of come and not go, but it's sort of had these different chapters, I guess, is how you characterize it, right? Yeah. All right. And so, you've now founded a bunch of successful companies, your self-addom and you've sold some to different entities. What have you learned and what are some mistakes you've made? What are some things you've learned along the way? Yeah. Well, you know, one is that if you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that appeals to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. And so, I've tried to focus on finding market problems and solving them with technology. The second and this won't be any deep insight, but it's all about the team and the quality of the people around the table trying to solve the problem you're trying to solve. And so, I really focus on that. I'm very proud of the team we've put together at Domain Money, about 25 of my former colleagues from Goldman Sachs chose to join me in this new adventure. And in addition to those folks, we've hired Brad Olson, who was the head of content for seeking alpha, the head of trade ops from Kenneth Gerald, we hired a COO who ran the crypto business for so far. We've established a really solid team that is very focused on our mission, which is to build our customers wealth. You have a metaverse part of it or no. Well, we will bring additional assets onto the platform over time. I think you'll see us getting into the NFTs base sooner rather than later. And so customers can look forward to that in the coming months. All right, let me know when you get the metaverse thing down. Okay. I'll add sad going to Domain Money. Question, how do you see using your influence on this world? Well, I don't know how much influence I have other than I like building things. I like catalyzing teams around specific objectives and goals and trying to motivate at set direction there. It is very fun for me to build things. I genuinely enjoyed it. I get a real rush out of creating something and then having people use it. And so I'm very focused on making sure that we deliver the best investment platform experience in the market. I remember when Goldman was working on the Apple card and there was chatter among the industry and even within the halls of Goldman Sachs, what does the world need another credit card for? And if you've ever used the Apple card, it's really a delightful unique experience. And I think the same opportunity exists in investment platforms where there are real improvements that can be made in the customer experience, the customer support, the education process, the journey that we take customers down as we help them try to make better investment decisions. And so I'm very focused on that as well as the rest of the team. Adam DelVC and founder and CEO of Domain Money. Thanks so much for your time. Thanks for having me. You've been watching influencers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,50,2022-10-24 17:30:43
3969," the rest of the team. Adam Del V.C. and Founder and CEO of Domain Money. Thanks so much for your time. Andy, thanks for having me. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Servor. We'll see you next time. There is room however for him to do more as we head into 2023 and I do expect that. On the other side of that equation, I think we have Bobak Plus, which is going to continue to cut production and make sure that the market does not feel a lot of downward pressure. Why are they going to do this? Because the macro environment is super challenging right now with cross-currents, Chinese demand as a huge concern, European recession as a huge concern, and they really want to support prices in the near term and not let the bottom fall out of crude as it has done in previous cycles. Then Rebecca, given those, you have OPEC Plus cutting, you have the body administration putting more oil out there on the market, what does that mean for prices? It's a great question and a lot of that hinges on what happens as we head into the December 5th EU sanctions package and how much Russian crude is disrupted based on those sanctions. So I personally think the market is anticipating about a million barrels of Russian crude to be disrupted due to the increased sanctions and that ultimately the floor undercrued is strong enough to hold, but the upside is a little bit more of the unknown. If we lose a million barrels of Russian crude and China demand starts to improve and I know the data we saw today wasn't really indicative of that, but if it does, you could see a lot more upside. So I think ultimately you have downside kind of to that 70 to 75 range and you have upside north of 100. So if you're looking at risk reward, it really feels like at this point we're fairly well balanced, but the upside tail looks a little bit more explosive. However, there are very few investors willing to put that money to work. If we look at positioning that came out over last week, we saw continued cutting of WTI, Brent, and gasoline products positioning as the market is really afraid of all of these risks and not really feeling comfortable making a bet either way. So I think that's what increases the volatility is the lack of positioning and this really these really outside tails on either end of the spectrum here. This China still want to be a purchaser of Russian oil supply? I think they do. So I think that it makes a lot of sense for them and if we just look at their most recent actions, they're increasing their imports of crude even though their demand for crude isn't increasing why? Because they increase their quota for export of product. So they're buying cheaper crude from Russia. They're increasing their refining capacity and they're selling that really expensive product out to the market. As we have all talked about refining margins have been really really robust and they're able to turn that profit. It makes sense for them on a multitude of levels. It helps spark internal demand and keep the economy going a little bit. It feels a whole of the product supply that could be disrupted from Russia and they're able to turn a profit. So I do think they're going to continue to want Russian crude. I don't think they're going to be super public about it but I think they'll continue to buy it. Rebecca, we've seen some reports recently that looking at the heating oil market this winter, US consumers, they might see their bills go up anywhere from 20 to 30 percent. Does that sound about right to you? Yeah, it does and it's unfortunate but the reality is our heating oil inventories are very low. I mean the lowest I think that they've ever been. Does it mean that we're going to have run out of inventories? No, it means that we're going to have the potential for spites particularly in a cold winter and I think it's drawing a lot of concern and that's why we're seeing China's really ramp up their diesel exports because those refining margins are so high for diesel. The US is in this situation because we've cut a lot of our refining capacity. So even though we have a lot of crude coming out of the ground, we don't necessarily have the refiner's there to produce it into product to help you know kind of meet these needs. So",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,51,2022-10-24 17:35:10
3970," we have a lot of crude coming out of the ground. We don't necessarily have the refiner there to produce it into product, to help kind of meet these needs. So unfortunately, yeah, 20 to 25%, I think is kind of where prices are looking. If we get a mild winter, that could come in. But it's really kind of a weather dependent scenario. And I think there's a lot of fear baked into that as well. Rebecca, I'm gonna ask a question that is absolutely fueled by my own personal aspirations of seeing lower airline prices in the future. And where in this environment, they're purchasing from the different suppliers and refineries, and particularly where that will actually net out for them to see lower fuel costs. We saw it show up in American Airlines earnings that they were paying 97% higher for some of their supply. And so when will that start to subside for the airlines and their purchasing requirements that they need just to operate their routes? I don't think that subsides in the next six months or even maybe the next year, unfortunately, unless, and this will be the sad scenario, we have more restrictive travel policies globally to COVID, but based on where things are right now, with the demand stays worth at, and I kind of feel like it might. You don't really see that pullback in jet, because again, you need someone to refine all that crude into jet fuel. And right now, it's more attractive to refine it into diesel, because that has the higher refining margin. So you're gonna use all your refinery capacity to diesel, and then you'll do jet, right, until the price of jet becomes so expensive that people reconfigure their refiners to sell jet. So the sad answer is probably not for a little while. You might see a modest dip, but I don't think you go back to kind of really, really attractive pricing for at least a year. Rebecca, I just purchased five new blankets from Target, because I'm not hitting my thermostat this winter. I'm not touching it. It might be 60 degrees in my place, just not going near it. Rebecca Babin, Cener, Energy Trader, CIBC, Private Wealth, always good to see you. Talk to you soon.

Global markets have been watching the situation China closely as President Xi consolidates power and enters an unprecedented third term as leader of the country. The move making many uneasy as US and China relations are already strained. Last week, Yao finances, editor-in-chief Andy Sober sat down with economist Noreal Robini during the all-market summit to discuss the state of US-China relations and Andy joins us now. Andy, Dr. Doom always good to catch up with him. Yeah, Dr. Doom, Noreal Robini, saying that we're already in a third cold war with China. So not very good for the sensibility there or the markets. But when you're talking about Xi Jinping consolidating power, Brian, over the last week, it really wasn't a surprise. But I think the particulars surprised people how he did it. If you saw, for instance, the footage of the former president, Hu Juntao being removed forcibly from those meetings that was really chilling. Look at this stuff. This is all for show because this didn't have to be done. What a humiliation for the former president. You see Xi Jinping just sitting there. Some people were saying that, well, he was Hu Juntao was not well and needed to be removed. But that didn't have to be done publicly like that, I think. There's a number of things going on in China. I think that the peaceful transition of power in this authoritarian regime has been something that has actually really been kind of remarkable for China since Mao Zedong. And now you've got a situation where, instead of two terms, there's three terms. That's unsettling. A couple of other points you guys that are also unsettling. One, using the zero tolerance COVID policy to turn the country more into a surveillance state. Number one, number two, also reducing corruption and trying to address wealth inequality. But also using that as an opportunity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,53,2022-10-24 17:43:52
3972," Number two, also reducing corruption and trying to address wealth inequality, but also using that as an opportunity to remove political opponents is something else that Xi Jinping has done. And if you look and see how the markets in China and Hang Tsang have responded, that is not a pretty picture in my understanding is that's the worst drop since 2007-2008. So stand, Druck and Miller was talking the other day. We need to look forward 18 months, 24 months out. What does it look like? This situation is not going to be a great situation, I think, for tech stocks, for Chinese stocks, for companies that have big exposure there. So it's unsettling and unnerving. There's still so much that is unresolved on the kind of tit for tat trade war that took place back during the Trump administration. And so even now, with this move in China, what does that signal for the Biden administration? In terms of the broader business component here in rectifying some of those issues that still are unresolved? Well, Brad, it's not like President Biden has reduced those tariffs. And in fact, he's imposed measures that are arguably more harsh when it comes to the tech sector and chips. And you can understand that because when you're talking about surveillance, this is a real risk to the US economy and to the global economy. On the other hand, it's not doing anything to increase trade and kind of alleviate tension. And then, of course, hanging out across the horizon there is Taiwan and the situation there. And how that is going to be resolved, that is something that is very much front and center on Xi Jinping's agenda. And how that transpires if and when China ever reclaims that island nation as part of China per se, it's going to be a very, very touchy thing going forward. I'm not telling you guys any, you don't know. But I guess the bottom line is, things are not really getting better. And what's really interesting and back to your original point, Brad, is Republican President, Democratic President, continuity, right? Same thing. And so that's tough for relations there. Hey, that footage at the top. Wow, that was just jarring. Yeah, it's shocking. And, you know, again, people are saying, oh, he wasn't well. Well, you know, they could have just said, we're going to take a pause here, turn the camera off. And the senators were there, Chinese media not reporting on that, but the footage is out all over the place. So in other words, the Chinese leadership wanted this footage out there. They don't want to comment on it. And you know, look at this. Just, it's just, they're almost no acknowledgement. You know, straight, right? Look at this. Look at that body language right there. Yeah. Wow. Right. Yeah. Unreal. Wow. All right. We'll leave it there for right now. I'll find it's editor-in-chief. End user. I'm always going to see you. Thank you guys.

3973," Go tricky. The snaps, Ugly Arnex report, is sent fresh shock waves throughout a social media landscape struggling with slowing growth, bloated costs and weak stock prices. So what's the next shoot to drop here? I've got to say research, senior analyst, Rocco Strauss joins us now to discuss Rocco. Good to see you this morning. Is it time to start picking at the rubble here? You just stay away from the space. I guess with respect to Snap, I mean, there still remains to be an unfavorable apricot hasn't mixed for them. With Snap being overly dependent on discretionary spend, when you think about the VC bag, grocery and crypto, App installed, you know, budgets vanishing in the last quarter or so. It's still an overhang from Apple's ATT or the IDF-8 issue weighing on gaming budgets. And Snap is now also seeing brand budgets moving to the sidelines, which is probably like the macrohead from that death lacking. So your best proxy is probably looking back to 0809, where 2008 was still a fine year for ad agencies and a lot of brands spent and then 09 or a year after literally met another thing's hit. You saw like a minus 10% or so hit on top line on these guys. So back to Snap, I would still say that against, you know, like TikTok and other social media networks, there is a lot of utility on the platform, you know, especially with messaging. There's a lot of first party data that they have. And they're also like if you undermonetize ventures like maps and spotlight, you know, building AR features, you know, in an e-commerce environment and so on. And that actually makes a slightly positive on the prospects of Snap if they continue to invest through this recessionary environment. Is there a turnover in favorability of social media platforms? And if so, which ones are slated to continue to win kind of the screen wars and that attention for time, which directly correlates back into where and why advertisers would want to spend their dollars on these platforms? Right. I mean, I guess what you have seen now on Spotlight, on Snap, you know, you could say, you could talk about YouTube shorts, you could talk about Reels on Instagram. All these are kind of me to offerings to what TikTok is doing. And the question that we would raise is, you know, moving forward maybe a year from now, are we talking about TikTok stealing time away from these properties? Or are we having more utility alongside these other me to offerings that keeps people on the more established social media networks? It's hard to say where user adoption is going to go to. But there's a huge risk for TikTok now, not the other way around. Well, then how does Snap go about restoring investor confidence? Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, as what I had pointed out, it is really kind of like changing this advertiser makes, you know, like going more into DR, especially e-commerce related offerings. There is an integration with Shopify, the other others like that out there. That's what you have to prove and you have to start monetizing these, these ventures where you are not seeing ads right now, especially Spotlight, which will draw some of these TikTok budgets, you know, think about, you know, like also other video budgets coming live with respect to Netflix and Disney+, which will draw a lot of the linear TV budgets over into digital and they are likely also going to end up in some of the social media networks. All of the social media networks right now are trying to become the shopping mall or at least replace the need for going to physical retail and-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,55,2022-10-24 17:52:40
3974," likely also going to end up in some of the social media networks. All of the social media networks right now are trying to become the shopping mall or at least replace the need for going to physical retail and drive more conversion. Can they successfully fill the void where perhaps that in-person shopping experience can be offset by that virtual shopping experience driven by interest and then actual purchase decisions? And do you see that actual amount of money that's going to be spent on this platform, on these platforms improving over the near term as well? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a few things that need to happen there, right? First, we have to work on friction. Friction between looking at products, buying them after sales service with respect to messaging integrations and so on. And these platforms are working on that. You see that was picked to messaging functionality on WhatsApp, you know, in the meta universe, and we are going to see more of that. The second thing that we need to see is more integration of inventory. So literally everyone of these social media platforms has integrated with Shopify now. There are many more similar offerings like Shopify out there to think about like the WooCommerce for example, and so on. These need to happen and need to be smooth as well. You have to think about like combined baskets so that a checkout experience, you know, might work significantly easier than it is today. And then lastly, when you also think about all these ID headwinds that we're having and Apple's ATT is just the beginning, right? You have to think about like SDK runtime on Android, you have to think about cookies disappearing for many of these retailers. Both OmniChannel and smaller DTC brands, it is becoming significantly harder to track from an ad to a conversion if there is not an on-platform checkout functionality embedded into that. So the more we are going towards in that direction of IDs disappearing, the more likely we're going to see adoption of these on-platform functionalities. And that should increase the shopping that we're seeing on these platforms. Okay. And so with so much of that focus on shopping, being either prompted by the consumer data that the companies, the social media platforms are looking at, or just by the trends of how many people are just comfortable spending their money through a social media platform, does that mean that there's an authenticity vacuum with legacy social media right now? If everybody's just trying to sell me on something and content creators, I know that they're in partnership with someone who wants to get my dollar at the end of the day, then where do I go to actually just have that valuable connection? Yeah, I mean, if you think about some of the larger retailers out there, right? So name Amazon, name Etsy, name eBay. All of these have an issue that they don't really have any social media connections or offerings on the side. It might be with Twitch, but still small compared to other social media networks. But what all of them have and throw Shopify in their bucket as well is they have huge audiences and they have huge intent and conversion data. And if that sort of data can be made actionable into these social media environments, and that brings us to the discussion of clean rooms and privacy laws and so on, but if that data can be made actionable, then we're not going to be overloaded with shopping related ads. And it's going to be likely significantly more targeted than we have seen it so far. Okay. All right. Perhaps just my own sugar in that I inserted there into the conversation. ArrateTech, research, senior analysts, the ROCOS droughts. We appreciate your analysis of all these companies and breaking that down for us this morning. Thanks. Coming up, Big Tech earnings are on tap this week. But what does this mean for ETF investors? We've got that conversation for you next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,56,2022-10-24 17:56:54
3975," ​ All eyes are on big tech this week with Apple, Amazon, and Meta plus AlphaBet all set to report earnings. But how will this impact ETF investors? Betify head of research Todd Rosenbluth joins us now to discuss. Okay, so help us break this down. I mean, with regard to some of the ETF trends that we've seen thus far, what are inflows looking like into tech sector ETFs? Well, the technology sector has been relatively strong in 2022. We've seen over $6 billion of money go into technology ETFs that's following on with some of the more defensive sectors. So we've seen strong inflows into consumer staples, strong inflows into utilities. Healthcare has actually been the leading sector, whereas consumer discretionary and communication services sectors have seen net outflows. And as we tie into the big tech earnings that he talked about, it really matters what ETF we're talking about and whether how it's classified. Todd, where do you see investors gravitating to more specifically in the tech? Are they still staying clear of anything that owns a social media stock? I think what the real focus for them is understanding what is inside these portfolios. So we mentioned earlier Meta and AlphaBet are reporting results. Those are classified as communication services companies in many of the sector ETFs. So you would find that in XLC, which is a communication services sector spider ETF, but you would not find Meta or AlphaBet within the technology select sector spider, which is XLK or the Vanguard information technology ETF VGT. Because of those, these sector ETFs are tied to the Gix sector framework and S&P and MSCI classified companies like Apple and Microsoft as technology companies like Meta and AlphaBet as communication services companies. And so the devil is in the details as to what's inside these portfolios. So with regard to all of these big tech names, it's still going to come down to what their free cash flow looks like and where their maintaining margins within their businesses. Some of them very much advertising focused or all of their businesses advertising, whereas some of them have a little bit more at play with regard to Amazon there. So what would you be watching kind of throughout these tech earnings to see where they're maintaining.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,57,2022-10-24 18:01:40
3976," advertising, whereas some of them have a little bit more at play with regard to Amazon there. So what would you be watching kind of throughout these tech earnings to see where they're maintaining some of those margins? So I think the focus for all of these companies were likely to see the currency headwinds happen. All of these companies are multinational in nature. It's different how their exposure happens to be, but we've had a strong US dollar that is going to weigh down on overall profitability. It just comes down to how profitable they were before the currency impact. And so a company like Apple, which is again in the technology sector and part of VGT or XLK, the demand for iPhone is going to be important. A company like Meta, of course, that's tied to search, you're going to have different impact search as well as social media. You're going to have a different impact as well. So I'm not an expert on individual companies, but I do think investors are looking to get exposure to these companies through the diversification benefits of an ETF and they need to know what's inside those ETFs. Todd, is anything surprised you this earnings season? I think it's been better than we've seen and expected. I think financials has been relatively strong and you get exposure to financials through the financial select sector, spider ETF and through bank oriented ETFs like the spider S&P bank ETF. I think it's been relatively strong, the bar tends to be set relatively low, heading into earnings season and companies have been exceeding that relatively low bar. But we'll see what happens. And again, ETF investors get the benefits of diversification across the sector as opposed to having to pick an individual winner heading into an after earning season. Do you expect that any of these companies will either revise downward their guidance or pull guidance? I don't think we're going, I don't have the expertise to be able to dive into individual companies, but what tends to happen when companies report results, they tend to beat the expectations and then the guidance takes a look at where we are from an economic perspective. And so the dollar is likely to continue to be strong or likely to see the impact of rising interest rates, impact the overall economy and recession has been top of mind for many companies. So they're more likely to lower the bar and again seek to exceed that during earnings season, growing investors, something else to watch beyond the current forecast looking further into the future. I wish you were here, Todd, because the big energy is flowing on this desk between me and Brad. We are psyched for app earnings. This is a big, big week of earnings. Always an exciting time for all of us. Vetify head of research, Todd Rosenbluth. Good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. All right, midterms are just two weeks away. A new poll finds that the Dems are facing a tough fight in the key swing state of Ohio. Tomorrow, let's bring in our very own senior columnist, Rick Newman. Rick. We're facing a lot of tough fights and it's looking pretty clear at this point that Republicans are very likely to take back the House. The Senate might be 50-50, but to go to that Senate race in Ohio, that's where Tim Ryan, the current congressman, is facing JD Vance. And I mean, there you see it's tied. This is interesting because President Trump won Ohio in 2020 by a considerable margin. So in this race, the Democrat actually is outperforming, but that is not the case in some other states where Nevada, for example, where Democrat incumbents are in real trouble. So it looks like we're going to have divided government after the midterm elections. That is not a bad thing for markets. What it mostly means is that we're just not going to see any significant legislation during the next two years. Okay, so Rick, with all the key races that we have been watching here, I mean, is there going to be any actual legislative agenda, changes, any policy headway that gets made post-election? The one thing that's gotten a lot of attention recently is Kevin McCarthy in the House, who would probably be speaker if Republicans take the House. He has indicated that Republicans may not sign off on or easily sign off on the next extension of the federal borrowing limit. That's probably going to come up in mid to late 2023. And that means we could have one of these standoffs that we've seen before where the federal government can't borrow money. It goes right down to the wire. This type of standoff led to the downgrade of US debt all the way back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,58,2022-10-24 18:05:29
3977," seen before where the federal government can't borrow money. It goes right down to the wire. This type of standoff led to the downgrade of US debt all the way back in 2011. So we might get another one of those. Republicans have also suggested they may not easily sign off on funding for military aid to Ukraine. McCarthy said, don't expect a blank check on that. So that's another thing to watch. But for markets, we're not going to have any tax increases. That seems very sure. We're not going to have any big new spending programs. So there is often a rally in the stock market after the midterm elections. And some people are saying maybe that'll be a little bit of something fueling a late year rally this year. Right. What do you think? Look, the political wins are constantly changing day to day. But what do you think is the biggest issue in the minds of voters? Is it still gas prices and heating all costs? Like we've been talking to yours. It's something like just popped up recently. The federal, the loan changes to the student loan program being blocked. I, you know, I, this is actually shifted. So obviously the Biden administration paid a lot of attention to gas prices during the last four months, let's say. And Biden has been releasing oil from the strategic reserve to get that down. Gas prices are now around $3.80, which I think is OK. I think what has snuck up on Biden has been these other types of inflation. I mean, we've seen food inflation is now 13%. Moody's Analytics has a nice piece of analysis out today saying they think one of the biggest factors in midterm elections is real disposable income. And on that, so that's your income, your paycheck, after inflation. And Biden, the Biden economy is doing very poorly on real disposable income, mainly just because inflation is eating away at wage gains. So all of this makes people feel really unhappy. And when they're unhappy, they blame the incumbents. So that is one of the big reasons Biden's Democrats are probably going to take it on the chin. You look happy, Rick. I'm happy. Brad's happy. So happy. Let's bring on the wake. Rick Newman, thanks so much. Hi, guys. Coming up, vegetarians listen up. A new Beyond Meat Item is coming soon. And we'll discuss next. Hi.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,59,2022-10-24 18:10:17
3978," Let's check. Welcome back to Y'all for Finance Live, everyone. Just over a little bit, just over an hour actually into today's trading session here. And taking a look at the S&P 500, we actually dipped into negative territory here for a hot moment. Reverse course back in positive territory up by about half a percent right now. And as that composite, you're also seeing that still in the red as right now early morning oscillation that we were tracking, but now we're down by about half a percent there. So we'll keep it close to there. And the Dow Jones industrial average. You're seeing that hold on to gains. It's up by about 9 tenths of a percent right now. Some of the other movers that have been keeping close tabs on this morning as well. Been watching retail, Amazon of course, that's going to be reporting earnings later on this week. But also in tandem with that watching Walmart here. It's up by about 1.6 percent. You're seeing Costco up by about 2.2 percent here early in the morning and Target or Tarje. That's up by about 7 tenths of a percent. But then additionally here, just quickly checking in on some of the pharmacy benefits managers. And here's why the Walgreens Flu Index is actually 10 times higher right now year over year. This comes after the CDC had actually given out warning last week about an elevated level for flu co-inciting with the, of course, COVID, the novel coronavirus as well. And so with that going into the next weeks and months of the winter, we're going to be keeping a close eye on that. Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi seem to be trending in the highest as of right now. We're seeing Walgreens boots, alliance shares down flat, but to the downside right now on the day. A lot of green though on the screen for the other PBM sauce. Yeah, although supermarkets shut out, definitely have me excited about Apple earnings later in the week, Brad. All right, switching gears here. The internal revenue service announced a welcome cost of living adjustment to the US is marginal tax rate that will increase the take home pay for many workers in 2023. Joining us now with more on the latest tax brackets is blue ocean and global wealth CEO Margarita Chang. Margarita, good to see you here this morning. So what do these changes mean to the average consumer? So this is actually a positive. Who would have thought inflation is positive, but because inflation has been at the highest level in 40 years, what that means is you could find yourself in a lower tax bracket because the IRS has raised the income levels. So you could be earning the same if not slightly more and still end up in the same tax brackets. Okay. So, all right. Help me understand this. Like, how quickly does this go into effect? I mean, is this, is this just immediate? Sure, I definitely can understand. So I know that we just finished taxes in April. There are some people who filed an extension, so they just submitted their 2020 return October 15th. And I know we're in 2022 and 2022 is not over, but we are planning for 2023. So here's the takeaway. The US tax system is not a flat tax system. It is progressive. It's graduated. So there are, as you can see on the screen, there are seven tax brackets. The lowest is 10%. The highest is 37. So I want people to understand is if you find yourself in the middle, 24% tax bracket, that does not mean that you pay 24% on all $364,000. You pay 10% on the first 11, then from 11, then it goes up. So that's what we mean by graduated. So this does go into effect for 2023. And the reason why it is going into effect is the IRS has made adjustments. I don't need to tell you all that inflation is real. And this is based on cost of goods and services for 80,000 items. Okay. And so with all of this in mind, how does this actually impact the real take home wages for people? Does it change anything there?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,60,2022-10-24 18:14:17
3979," of beyond meat today. Wow. Gathered down 5% after the plant-based meat company announced a new offering beyond steak. The finalist's book to Palma is here with the details. That's right Brad. Beyond me looking to cook out some excitement here. We're doing the opposite. As you said, shares down nearly 6% this morning. Of course, and frozen food comes out today beyond steak. It's seared. It's bite-sized pieces and can be prepared on what they're saying. Either a skillet or an air fryer in just 5 minutes. Of course, this comes as the frozen food section. Say a bit of a boom here. This year, 70 billion sale, 70 billion dollars in sales happened for the frozen food aisle. That's a 31% jump since 2019. But if you take your closer look at this offering, they're really looking to expand it to a broad audience from meat lovers, flexitarians alike. It includes 21 grams of protein per serving. They're saying it's low and saturated fat, 0 miligame of cholesterol. But if you look at where it's being offering, really looking to hit across the U.S. today, beyond steaks launching at Kroger, Walmart, Albertsons, and A-hole divisions, of course, that's a name that we may not know exactly, but I've seen, especially here in New York. That includes stop and shop giant food lion and fresh direct. Of course, this adds to the Beyond Meat portfolio. Back in 2020, we saw Beyond Meat add meatballs at Costco. We also see that opportunity at Target. But the Beyond Steak yet to be determined if this would be offered there as well. Of course, meat saying here that this was a highly anticipated expansion to its beef lineup, which now includes burgers, beef, sausage, and meatballs. But yet to be determined, just how excited Main Street is and Wall Street this morning, like I said before, down nearly 6% shares of Beyond Meat. So not drumming up too much excitement here. Yeah, bro, yeah, 21 grams of protein call definitely important for folks such as myself and our former FedCore, Sponor, Brian Chung. But look, Beyond Meat just had a lot of layoffs. How do they launch a product like this? Yeah, that's a great question. Of course, last week, the brand announced it's set to cut 19% of its global workforce. Of course, that included their cheap operating officer Doug Ramsey, who is a rest day in late September for allegedly biting a man's nose at an Arkansas football game. In addition to that, if you take a look year to date one year ago, right here, it is down 87%. Now, year to date down 80%. And if you take a look back to their IPO in 2019, it is down 81%. Now, in addition to that, dealing with a lot of other noise out there in October 18th, Beyond Meat and Plant-based Food Maker, Don Lee settled to dispute over previous partnership. Both sides are satisfied with the outcome according to court filings. But Beyond Meat really looking to push forward, looking to come out with these innovations, hoping to grab consumers attention. Of course, here they're keep on pushing on. I guess you could say here, calling it once again, a highly anticipated expansion, really looking to continue to enthuse and excite consumers about these new offerings. Brook, while we have you with all the expansions that they've been making, they had been investing so much into taking the operations under their own home, not licensing or renting space at other manufacturing practices in at least areas. And so with that in mind, investors have had to price in how much they're spending of their own money just to make sure that they can bring more of that operation in houses. Is it clear how they're doing in terms of producing all of these new menu items? Yeah, that's a great question. Well, what we can relate that to is the test that they did with McDonald's in hopes to launch that McPlan and while it launches the UK and Ireland overseas, it's really, you know, TBD on what exactly that will look like. One exactly we might see that nationwide here in the US. So investors really standing by and waiting to see if all these major investments that they're putting out are seeing a return on that share price. Yeah, we'll find this is on Brook to Palmo with a breakdown on Beyond Meat this morning we appreciate it. Appreciate it, Brook. Not beyond. It's Monday. It is Monday. Let's Monday. Brian Brad Brook is the hour. I know we are bullish on BR's around here at Yahoo Finance. Thanks so much, Brook. Appreciate it. Come again, everyone. Walmart, relaunching and renaming.

3980," We'll appreciate it. Come with us everyone, Walmart, relaunching and renaming. It's Sleepwear brand. We've got the details next. Marianne Xu Clinic, The bass. It's time for Cup of Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. Walmart is reinventing its intimits and sleepwear line, replacing the billion dollar brand secret treasures with the more modern and contemporary style brand. Joy's spun. I don't know. I think they've never heard of the other one. Yeah, I didn't even know. It just takes me back to what Walmart did. This was 10 or 15 years ago, it was an analyst. They made it to a big push into more high-end fashion and their parallel is a complete flop. I'm going to be very, very fascinating to see how a brand like this does inside of Walmart, which really for the past 10 years, since that really dreadful push into fashion has been just been focused on very affordable, cheap basics. I don't know the prices on these, but this looks a little bit more fashionable than I think Walmart is known for. It's all about the homegrown brands. I mean, Walmart, of course, has some big partners on the apparel front that has allowed them to move into, you know, of course, all of these storefront locations brick and mortar that Walmart dominates in. But then it comes down to, all right, where is Walmart also growing up their own brands? Walmart doing this target, or Tarje doing that. Amazon also doing this too. Amazon has what, 12 of its own homegrown lines. And so it's really just that ease of knowing you're in the store to perhaps get some of your eggs there. And instead, you know what, I could be intimate. The intimate's from there. I'm not going. Not going. And money geek finding that burger combos are 9% more expensive than last year.

3981," I'm not surprised by this. I believe about a month ago, I ordered myself two breakfast sandwiches from McDonald's. Now I get double leg, I get double meat. I pay $28 and I didn't even get a drink. $28 along Island, New York for two. Again, not the standard order, but I go into the McDonald's, I have a touch screen, I customize everything. I mean, it was $28 for two sandwiches. Do you? What? I know. I had to do a double take. I was just absolutely shocked. Wait, why didn't they were good? You didn't select a combo? No, I just, I like building my own salads because I need the double leg, I need the double meat, like I'm hungry. I'm really hungry. I mean, I get that, but you've got to make sure you're getting the drink. I know. I'm not surprised. Look at these combo meals. You walk into a lot of these restaurants now. I mean, they are no longer, combo meals were started to essentially save people money. Now, look at this. Are you kidding me? But when you look at the history of when some of these combo meals originated to, it was during economic downturns, or at least pullbacks in some of the consumer discretionary categories too, trying to make more of a value push in value play. All right, guys, let's talk about my beloved Philadelphia Phillies here. Today, the latest recession indicator could be the Philadelphia Phillies winning the World Series. Every Phillies World Series win, or I should say, Philadelphia baseball team win in the last 100 years has been followed by an economic downturn. It was the Philadelphia Athletics that kind of kicked that off. They're saying they're 1929, and then later on, the Phillies 1980. I remember 2008 and the pandemonium that just absolutely ensued after the Philadelphia's won the World Series. It was a great time, but not so much economically at least. I've wanted to support everything. I always want to support you, Robert. I can't root for the, I can't root for the Phillies. Because they just boo everybody. What was it, Jill Biden, the first lady two weeks ago at the Eagles game? She got booed. They booed Santa Claus. How am I? I can't put my support behind the Phillies. That's not special. Even though the Astros, even the Astros just demolished my Yankees. And they, you know, some would say they are, were cheaters. They are cheaters. But, you know, the Phillies, you can't boo the first lady and Santa Claus? We boo everybody. Santa Claus. We boo everybody. We got the best mascots. We got Gritty and we got the Philadelphia Athletics. That's Gritty. Yeah, and for a while, we had a bunny rabbit as the sixers mascot as well, hip hop. And so with all of this in mind, I mean, look, we're a fandom that's known to fight our own athletes in parking lot. I understand. All right, coming up, a kick off for GDN. Ojly Kallani will speak to you. A quest. Diagnostics. You won't want to miss it again. Markets are hanging tough, starting the week on a pretty good note. Dow up more. I think you want to hold it.

3982," 🎵 Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what we're watching at this hour. Coronation complete. Chinese president Xi Jinping secures a third term as leader consolidating power, but investors given the cold shoulder as greater China market sell off on economic uncertainty. Bracing for another tech crack, Big Tech prepares to report quarterly results this week. The digital absolute on firmly in focus after snaps free fall last week and looking for stability. Sterling gets a bump as the UK gets its latest Prime Minister former Chancellor Sunak Rishi Sunak steps into 10 downing street as fresh data points to a deep downturn. First let's check in on the market action though. We are 90 minutes into the trading day right now. A bit of a split picture. Obviously the NAS that can be the big focus of the week with those big tech earnings on tap. It is down about 26 points right now. The Dow up to 156 points though and the S&P 500 up 20. We're also watching the bond yields closely here. We've talking about a bit of a pullback last week on potentially a fed pivot up. We are seeing those yields back up today. Take a look at the 10 year yield that 428. The 30 year yield now well above 4.4%. We are beginning this hour though with all eyes on China. President Xi Jinping officially securing a third term on Sunday making him the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Xi consolidating power by packing the Politburo standing committee with the most loyal to him. China's third quarter GDP data delayed by a week came in above estimates with growth at 3.9% in year over year. But a robust recovery remains elusive as China faces challenges such as persistent COVID-19 curves and global recession risks. We should point out that that stocks lower in greater China on investor fears of Xi's new term favoring ideology driven policies over growth. The Hang Seng and Hong Kong captains were stay since the financial crisis in 2008. And the Shanghai comp also down about 2% there. Major Chinese tech names also falling into the red on concerns about Xi's embrace of state-owned firms versus private companies. We have a panel for you to break it all down for us. We have China's Beijing Co-founder and CEO Lila Miller alongside Keith Cracky's Chairman of the Crack Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. Gentlemen, this great to have both of you on today. Lila, let me just start with you on the reaction that we got overnight in the Asia session here. Certainly it looks like investors not feeling very comfortable with which direction China is now heading in with Xi securing his third term. What do you make of this sell off? Well, it's not altogether clear whether markets believe China's economic data this time around. But what's pretty clear is that nobody was very happy with the way that Xi packed the new leadership with loyalists. I think there was always a desire to see somebody who symbolized more market openings, disagreements in the top leadership, some sort of a fulsome pushback against COVID-19. Look, you can read tea leaves a million different ways here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,64,2022-10-24 18:34:17
3983," putting disagreements in the top leadership, some sort of more fulsome pushback against COVID-0. Look, you can read T. Leaves a million different ways here. But when you look at who he put up next to him, it looks like it's gonna be the she-show with very little pushback against him. And I think that worries people who've watched the crackdowns of the last two years. Leland, just to follow up there, I mean, this did seem very much like a focus more on sort of national security, not necessarily on economic policy. And I know we don't come to expect that at the party Congress, but we're still looking at a growth rate here well above that five and a half percent target that was initially set out for the year. What does that tell you about where the economic priorities are for the third term for this president? I just think the economic priorities have completely changed from this time around. You know, we've been taught as China watchers to see the party as prioritizing growth above all. And that has been true for the last five, 10, 15 years. It is not true anymore. Now, the China we're looking at right now led by Xi Jinping is one focused more on security. It's focused more on restructuring the economy. So there's fewer vulnerabilities for the party in terms of reckless credit expansion in the property sector, shadow of finance out of control. They want to take control of the economy, reroute the economic growth model. And to do that, they have to materially slow down the economy, stop pumping credit in. So things are changing dramatically. They're not forgetting about the economy, but the Chinese economic growth model, as we know, it is over. And they're shifting to a more realistic stance. Keith, certainly from the US perspective, a lot to watch here in terms of the language that came out of the party Congress. One thing, certainly those in Washington watching here, the changing in terms of the language with the party's constitution here, specifically on Taiwan, using the word strengthened, fighting spirit and ability, deterring any kind of separatists or saying that they are in fact still moving in the direction of reunification. Why don't you take away from this party Congress in terms of the timeline China is now thinking about in terms of reunification? Well, I don't think there's any doubt, Keiko, that she is committed to that. She is not only the most powerful dictator since Mao, but he's probably the most powerful dictator in the world since Hitler. And he's probably even more dangerous. So I think a question for your viewers is not just what's the data, what's the analysis? Leeland is one of the great experts in the world on that. The question is, we know what's happening. There's no limit to his ambitions. So the question is, in terms of business boardrooms, what are you gonna do about it? And what are the moral responsibilities? What are the fiduciary duties that shareholders have to mitigate risk with these board members have to mitigate that risk for their shareholders? And I've spent a lot of time with the corporate boards out here in Silicon Valley. And all of these folks are putting together China contingency plans because they see the crackdown on the private sector. They see the draconian COVID lockdowns and they see no limit to his ambition for power. To what extent have those risks been elevated because of that consolidation of power that we saw over the weekend? When you said that you're talking to companies and their boards, what do those contingency plans now look like? Well, they cover a number of things. First of all, they cover supply chains because if there's any bottlenecks there, they all saw that during COVID. So that was a wake up call. The other big wake up call was when cheese totalitarian twin, put invaded Russia and 300 companies had to come out, they lost hundreds of billions. The China problems 10 to 20 time X that. So if there's a conflict in Taiwan, it's not only disastrous for the business community, it's catastrophic for the tech business because of Taiwan's lock on semiconductors. They also see the risk of cheap nationalizing firms, nationalizing, not being able to get their money out of there. But there's also a big question now, this pop it up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,65,2022-10-24 18:38:29
3984," of cheap nationalizing, firms nationalizing, not being able to get their money out of there. But the also big question now that's popping up, Akeiko, is these crimes against humanity. They're committing in places like Shinjong, United States, and several other countries have labeled that genocide. So there's a real moral issue because they export that slave labor all throughout China. And we have already seen legislation here in the U.S. to crack down on some of that. Leland, last question to you. You know, as you know, these party congresses are very closely orchestrated every single detail. It is really, it doesn't go without a hitch. And yet we saw what was kind of an awkward moment here, where we saw the former president Huzhintel being escorted out. He's sitting right next to Shinjongping there. It appeared at least that he didn't want to go. And there's been a lot being made of that. You know, what exactly was the message Shinjongping was trying to send if it was, in fact, that? What was your read on that moment that we saw over the weekend? You know, it's hard to know for sure. You know, we know that it was a pretty big humiliation for who. But are we absolutely sure this is part of a public urge of the Communist Youth League faction, which which barely exists anymore? That's not clear at all. Who's son was in the room? You know, he's in the Polo Bureau. So I guess if we track his career over the coming months, we'll be able to get indications of whether this is something that was specific against who, or it was some other dynamic. But very weird, with such a choreographed event, it is weird to have a spectacle like that that left people talking all weekend. So, you know, we're going to just have to watch the politics in the next couple of months to see to see what this was all about. Okay, appreciate you both joining us today. China-Bajibok, co-founder and CEO Lila Miller, along with Keith Krakis, chairman of the Krak Institute for Tech to Policy at Purdue. Well, turning now, looking ahead at the week ahead for markets, we have Yahoo finances and as for here to break it all down and as of course we're talking about the big tech names reporting here, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, you name it. Yeah, it's the Super Bowl of earnings really when you're talking about these big tech names. And as you just mentioned, these are the big mega caps that will be reporting earnings this week. And what's will be interesting to watch is Apple, Microsoft, Tuesday, Alphabet, Amazon on Thursday, Meta on Wednesday. But look, these companies, they're outsized, waiting in the S&P 500 is significant. Earnings per share are expected to fall year over year. But really the ones to watch for in my opinion are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon because Meta, you could say, has already gotten whacked and part of that has to do with advertising part it has to do with also Meta's strategy pivoting towards the Metaverse, which it announced earlier this year. But really, it will be interesting to watch Apple, what Apple says about China, what the advertising looks like when it comes to Meta, when it comes to Alphabet and YouTube, for example. And then most importantly, also is any talk of FX, for an exchange and how the currencies have been impacting revenue for these companies, for these companies that produce services. And also they sell their products abroad. Amazon 30% of its e-commerce comes from the international market. So it'll be interesting to watch to see how the strong dollar is impacting their performance. And it'll be interesting to see if they talk about constant currency, which is basically where they strip out that volatility. Also to watch out for for this week, preliminary reading of GDP. So for the third quarter that's expected to come in at 2.3% after the first and second quarter were contractions. So it'll be interesting to watch. Yeah, you mentioned FX, certainly something that we've heard from so many companies. It's also going to be interesting to hear what Apple has to say about this latest regulation coming down from the Biden administration on semiconductors because they've already frozen the use of YMTC chips, one of those Chinese makers that are now basically, you know, sort of their ban from selling to them. It'll be interesting if they talk about that, if they have any commentary on that. And also, of course, their iPhone demand and China supply chain. I mean, there's so much to talk about when we talk about Apple because it really is one of the bellweathers of the economy. Okay, a big week ahead. And that's thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look at Tesla shares right now, sliding after the EV maker slaps.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,66,2022-10-24 18:42:50
3985," about Apple because it really is one of the bell weather of the economy. OK, a big week ahead and that's thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look at Tesla shares right now sliding after the EV maker slash the price of its model three and model Y vehicles in China. The stock is down nearly 5% in the session. This coming after must comments during last week's Tesla earnings call saying there are elements of a recession in China. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, pros, supermanian. Pros, this has a lot of people saying, look, is he trying to start price war essentially in the EV market or the biggest EV market? Yeah, I mean, I think you see the model three coming down by 5% model Y base level by almost 9%. So there is concern there that demand is letting must, as you said, is much on the call. It's that is related to property market, but that sort of trickles on everywhere. Yeah, so analysts are thinking that, yeah, this could actually boost demand, but also could also lead to a price war. Other competitors like Leonardo, X-Pung, among others, could follow suit and they could actually do that with their pricing strategy. So I'm not surprised to see that. Also want to note that electric has seen that a Tesla is restarting the referral program. So if you buy a car through me through a referral link, you can actually get rewards points for like stuff like free supercharging. You also have raffles to get a bulk buckle and free use of a car for you. So they're trying to like just basically try to get that demand back up there in China. They had a record quarter of September, 80,000 sales or so. But I guess that's still not enough when you have like the Shanghai Gigafactory kind of increasing output and lead times coming down. So there needs to be a way to kind of get those cars off the door. What does that mean in terms of the revenue coming out of China if they have to lower the prices? I would imagine that would revenue be OK. I think of a hit willing. Yeah, I think revenue to be OK is margins will begin impacted. If they're making more than 80,000 cars a month out of China, that's a serious demand. Maybe they'll start exporting more to other places like Europe. But for now in the Chinese local market, it seems like demand slowing down, competition heating up, B-Y-D, 200,000 cars sold last month. So that's a big part of that whole equation. Yeah, B-Y-D giving them big competition in China. Thanks so much for that, Fraz. Well, shares of Meta are falling ahead of its quarterly results after Bank of America downgrade the stock from buy to neutral. It is up and low to the session still down about half a percent here. Analysts also lower the stock's price target from $196 to a share to $150 citing concerns about a decline in online ad spending. B-Y-D now expects that to slow down to accelerate next year with revenue growing at just 4% year on year. That's half of what the street is expecting. Analysts also saying that they are, in their words, incrementally more cautious on this content shift that we're seeing on Facebook and Instagram to reels this coming after those very disappointing snappers' all last week. Well, coming up on the other side, we are staying with the TXORIA's big tech reports allume. We're talking about Amazon, Apple, and Meta all showing their hands in the coming days. How much of an issue is over investment in this struggling ad market in the hawkish fed? We're going to dive into all of those issues on the other side.reu",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,67,2022-10-24 18:47:44
3986," Gerilim Well, it is shaping up to be a big week for the broader tech story with the likes of Apple, Amazon, and Metta all reporting in the coming days. Until now, a big revenue miss for Snap and signs of a dire online ad market has been the major warning sign for the space. The NASDAQ has plummeted over 30% since the start of the year outpacing declines for the S&P. The sector has also been contending with what my next guest calls a COVID hangover because of tech over-investment. Let's bring in Erica Klauer, a Jamison associate tech equity portfolio manager a lot to get through to this week. But let's start by looking back to what happened last week. We saw the huge sell-off coming on the back of Snap that has accelerated concerns about a decline in online ad spend. How much of that are we going to see reflected, especially in Metta and Alphabet? Well, we talked a little bit about the fact that a lot of the advertising at SnapChat has basically been a result of share loss. I think relative share gainers will be companies like Google, like Facebook. Never unless there is a lot more pressure in terms of justifying the price of advertising online that I think will persist throughout 2023. And so when you look at somebody like Alphabet, what we have learned, at least from the past few quarters, is that they are a little more diversified when it comes to this online ad spending. So obviously, it's not like Snap, or we're just talking about one particular app, you know, a specific market. Does that shield Alphabet for some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in a company like Snap? I think you're absolutely right. Google is much more diversified than a Snapchat is. And Sam goes for Facebook as well. What about Amazon? They have made making a lot of big in roads, especially in the advertising space. That's right. That has done a very, very good job with its advertising assets. And I expect that that division will continue to outperform and gain share. So how do you think investors should be looking at that? We'll sort of break down Apple separately, obviously, that there's a lot to get into there. But when you talk specifically about the stocks that are really affected by digital ads, and we're seeing a pullback in general, who is best positioned? Who do you stay away from? Well, I think overall spending will be somewhat pressured because there is a need right now to really look at all costs amongst all enterprises. There is rampant inflation with regards to labor costs and also input costs. So clearly, people are going to be scrutinizing their advertising budgets more than ever. However, in that context, the companies that are really executing and gaining share would include Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Let's talk about Apple. There's the obvious numbers that we look for in terms of where their demand is on iPhones, how they're expanding in services. But there's a larger story that I think a lot of investors are looking at that puts Apple right in the middle. And that is supply chain movements. We were just talking about China and the concerns that persist around there. Apple has a big presence even.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,68,2022-10-24 18:51:56
3987," Investors are looking at that puts Apple right in the middle. And that is supply chain movements. We were just talking about China and the concerns that persist around there. Apple has a big presence. They've been trying to move production into India away from China. And then there's this big tech control crackdown that the Biden administration has put forward that does affect Apple and where they source their chips. Well, if we take a giant step back, what we're looking at this week is accumulative is 7 trillion amount and market value of companies reporting this week amongst the big tech players. The advertising companies are in one bucket and then of course they're the hardware and software companies in the other bucket including the likes of Apple. And what I would say about Apple is that the company is executing extremely well. But it is not immune to the the trends that you just mentioned. It took decades to basically consolidate all of their manufacturing in lower cost regions. That's being undone right now as the supply chain is being diversified. So ultimately that is inflationary in its nature. And at the same time we have a much more difficult to man's environment where many people bought their smartphones. They bought their personal computers during COVID. So there's not that dramatic need that we've seen over the last three years to upgrade or even to attract the first time buyer. We can talk about the shift in where manufacturing is happening, where you source your supplies. What does that specifically mean in terms of inflationary? Are we going to are we looking at higher prices down the road? Is it going to be cushioned by the company just given the cash pile that they have? I mean how do you see that being reflected in the coming quarters? Well, there are companies that are just masters of their supply chain. Apple would be the poster child for that. However, I think that when one is thinking about duplicate efforts to ensure no disruption to supply chain, that inherently means higher costs. And so the company will have to really assert its pricing power in order to offset those higher costs. I think that's going to be a story over the next couple of years. Still the strongest name though in the big tech space? Absolutely. I think Apple is showing very strong gains in market share even now with its dominant position. It's still outpacing its peers in terms of adoption. Erica Klauer, Geneson Associates Technology, Equity Portfolio Manager. Let's get to talk to you today. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Well, one of the 40s of 2022 will happen only the hawkish bed and the occasional market meltdowns. But the lack of safe havens investors thought they could lean on. That's certainly the case with Bitcoin, which has spent much of the year following stocks. Think of America's latest crypto note offers some help for haven status, however, suggesting the possibility of price divergence are trying to today specifically take a closer look at the Bitcoin gold correlation. Something we've talked about before. It shows a negative trend from March 2nd before eventually turning positive on September 5th. And it's been staying there as ever with Bitcoin. Things change quickly. So we're going to continue to watch the space. Well coming up, diagnosing the future for class. We speak without going CEO Steve Ruskowski on a decade in the role. Our record sending 2021 and what our COVID testing revenues will continue trending downward. We certainly don't want to miss that. We'll be right back.

3988," A f so Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Two hours into the trading week. I've been on the split picture emerging, although positive with the Dow trying to build on those gains that we saw from last week, up about 260 points, the S&P 500 up 20, and then I have to act the only one that's down in the red, although slightly. Of course, earnings a big focus this week in terms of sectors that we're watching right now, health care, one of the biggest gainers on the day, and of course we're going to be talking about all those big tech earnings on tap this week. When now we're heading out to my colleague, Anjali Kamlani, who is joined by a special guest, Anjali. That's right, I keep going. Thank you so much. We are joined now by the CEO of Questagnostics, Steve Ryskowski, really a legendary individual in the health care space. Over the last 10 years, at the helm of one of the most important health care companies. Steve, thank you so much for joining here us here today. I just want to start off with obviously the pandemic. One of the most unprecedented situations that any CEO has had to contend with you, of course, seeing that demand on testing like never before. Tell us about it and how you got through it. Yeah, so it's been a busy 2.5 years, Anjali. It all started in the fall, excuse me, in the spring of 2020, when we first realized that this pandemic would be here and really sink its teeth into us. And so in March of 2020, we actually first started",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,70,2022-10-24 19:00:44
3989," you you you. Welcome to Yahoo Finance live on this Monday afternoon. I'm Shauna Sipa long with Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed on today's market action. Take a look at the major averages. You're still looking at gains. Take a look at the Dow up around five hundred points right now. That's a one point six percent gain as a composite up and nearly 1% SMP. You can see it now above thirty $4,800. That's again a nearly one and a half percent Russell 2000 also holding on to gains today Although up just around a two tens of a percent taking look at some of the bond market action here The 10-year yield pushing higher by just around two basis points to 423 30 year yield also pushing just a bit higher at 436 a lot of the focus on the street today on earnings also some of those geopolitical risks Specifically the new developments out of China, which we will get to a little bit more on that in just a minute But take a look at the Nasdaq 100 you can see some of the larger cap tech names that will be out with earnings later this week Apple Amazon Microsoft Google all posting intraday gains today You can see Microsoft leading the way up just around two percent inside the Dow the leadership there coming from some of those largest As well as United Health J&J also pushing to the upside you have murk up just about two percent and taking a look at the sector action Inter-day basis all 11 of S&P sectors as we enter the final hour of trading our posting gains today Healthcare you can see financials among the leaders there real estate those still holding on to gains although the Lager it, I guess you can say of the 11 sectors up just around two tenths of a percent date good stuff Thank you, Shana. Let's get you up to speed now in the situation in the UK A tumultuous period for the British economy getting some certainty today with conservatives naming Rishi Sunak to become the first Person of color to serve as UK prime minister at 42 Sunak also the youngest politician in two centuries Moving to the VRBO we now know as ten downing his predecessor Liz truss, of course in office for just 44 days a disastrous Tax cut plan sealed her immediate downfall in brief remarks Sunak saying there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge We need stability and unity and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together The footsie rallied slightly as did the dollar in response to the selection Let's now get you to Jared Blyckery against you have to speed with more overseas action. Hey Jared Hey there Well, let's take a look at those Chinese stocks that we were taking a look at or at least talking about a few Seconds ago. This is the Nasdaq golden dragon China index and let me tell you somebody this had This was a worst day it has ever had and you can see here's a candlestick chart over the last two days Let me Beat this up with a line chart there. You can see the carnage now here is a max chart and you can see well Let me put this on a six months basis. Maybe we can get that and you can see at the lowest levels in six months But as I said before worst day ever going back over 21 years for the golden dragon index And here is some of the carnage that we're seeing inside that Ali Baba is sinking below it's $68 IPO price you can see 62 52 let's get a max chart of Ali Baba there You can see basically at the lowest levels not quite just yet, but almost at the lowest levels some of those suffered in 2015 2016 Another issued pin duo duo that is down",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,71,2022-10-24 19:04:39
3990," Basically, at the lowest levels, not quite just yet, but almost at the lowest levels. Some of those suffered in 2015, 2016. Another issue, Pindu Oduo, that is down 25 percent. This stock has been hampered many times over the last couple of years. And the overall implications for this, the question on trader's minds, is this about China? Is this some idiosyncratic event? Or is this yet another one of the, I guess, canaries in the coal mine with respect to the global situation and the problem that risk markets have had? So we're going to have to see if this morphs into anything bigger. We didn't even get into the Chinese Yuan, which is at the worst levels, the weakest levels, versus the US dollar. That is the offshore Chinese Yuan we have ever seen. All right, Jared. Thanks so much for that. Of course, a big focus here for Wall Street is what's going on in some of those US listed Chinese names. When you take a look at the broader averages still holding onto gains, Dow off the highs of the day, up just around 489 points. So let's talk about all this with Linda Dissle, Federated Hermes, senior equity strategist. Linda, it's great to see you. Let's start with the losses that we're seeing overseas, specifically some of the concern about what this could mean for the US when it becomes US and China policy. And of course, economic implications there. From a market's perspective, though, do you think the reaction that we're seeing in some of these Chinese names is a bit of an overreaction? Well, thank you for having me, Shana and Dave. And we'll only tell whether this is an overreaction with what we've been through here in these last several years. Anything can happen, I guess we come to see. But the reason I think that the market is behaving so emotionally about this with what you saw with the footage and the leading out of the previous ruler of that country, it just, you know, and kind of a consolidation of power, everybody knew that President Xi would definitely get another term, maybe would be in place for our lifetimes. But this kind of a hold on power. He almost talks as if he doesn't care what markets think. He doesn't care what companies around the globe might do in terms of trying to exit there. I've heard many people say that Russia is uninvestable when we at Federated Hermes don't have exposure there. But we have had exposure internationally, and we've always said that China is the poster child for emerging markets. It's a really tough call right now to decide that that could be uninvestable, you know, so there's a lot of discussion that has to be had here. Yeah, it does appear at least on the outside. He does not care at this point. What do you make of our markets continuing to rally after the S&P gained 4.7 percent and still a strong start to this week? Yeah, much more comfortable talking about the USA here. Much more, well, we have said at Federated Hermes, we think that we're going to be in a broad trading range of 3,400 to 4,200 based on earnings and what price you ought to pay for them. We're kind of in the middle of that range. Benso for some number of months right now. And you know, I'm somebody who travels across the country pretty much every week. And one of the main questions that I get wherever I go is, what should I buy now? I believe there's still too much money on the sidelines. We have too much money. And we remember the great times. And I know that's a fact because we were buying mean stocks as recently as summer of this year. So we're all talking about global recession, slowing down here in the economy, inflation ought coming off as fast as the Fed wants. Why are we bidding up the markets? Well, you know, it's a midterm election year, right after every midterm election year, many of them most. You get a nice rally. You know, and you're starting to see, breadth come up again. It's just a lot of money looking for a place to put it to work. And I guess you may be are going to go buy China today and maybe won't buy Europe today. Well, Linda, let's talk a little bit more about that. I know you were saying that you have been asked this a number of times outside of some of those beaten up stocks today. Where are you seeing the opportunity? OK. So it's an interesting time to traverse. I've been comparing today with the 70s where you had vicious bear market rallies and then big pullbacks. We would call this a bear market rally and it can be a vicious one. And if you are a long-term investor and not a trader and you say, but you know what I have cash and I'd like to put some money to work. And let's look for something that might be a fat pitch. We're starting to look at maybe some more ideas over in Techland, some of the larger cap names, not necessarily speaking of the fang stocks. And some of the semiconductors we've seen are going to be an interesting place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,72,2022-10-24 19:08:59
3991," Maybe some more ideas over in Techland, some of the larger cap names, not necessarily speaking of the fangstarts, even semiconductors we've seen are getting to be an interesting place. And that's an early cycle play, but here we are, they've been bid down as if there were recession. Cheap as sectors, I should say industries, still energy very cheap, and we continue to like that a lot. Homebuilders, I'm low to say this on TV, homebuilders are being crushed right now, but it versus their forward PE is as cheap as it's been, really since the 1970s, you can say the same thing for metals and minings, you could say the same thing for banks. This is for a long-term investor and these are not particularly timely. But neither was the energy call back in November of 20, 21 we said, you know, you might take a flyer here, it's historically cheap. Oh, doubt. Looking forward to this week, it's gonna be a busy one, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta, just to name a few X on it, Chevron, you mentioned energy, just give me one thing you expect that will learn throughout a very pivotal earnings week. Yes, and it is, I believe about 48% of the market kept us going to tell us about their earnings this week, we've all said coming into this quarter, we're not worried about what happened in the last quarter, we're worried about the outlook, we're so afraid of the outlook, and we're going to watch for throughout the various sectors is what we've learned so far, which believe it or not, so far, forward earnings estimates are done just 1%. We're getting no message still yet of a weakness here in the USA corporates that are still having their own big expenses to pay, it's still having to pay up for workers, and that could be a tell that would allow the market to continue to power in a nice rally here into the year end, maybe backwards, back up to those highs of 4,200, then I would say have your cell list ready. This 2023 is going to be a very interesting year. We can all agree on that, Linda Distol, great to have you, appreciate it very much. We're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live, coming up the closer look at the geopolitical implications of Xi Jinping's third term, especially when it comes to US China tensions rising, plus the biggest names in tech in the spotlight this week with earnings on tap, we break down what you need to know and be on the lookout for. And if you thought it was a tough summer for air travel, get ready for a holiday season that could be even worse. Stick around.

3992," [♪OUTRO MUSICен [♪ competition tv Market's plunging today in Hong Kong. After a Chinese leader Xi Jinping solidified control over the ruling Communist Party and secured an unprecedented third term. Some of our founding editor at large, Steve Clemens, joining us now for the first time on Yahoo Finance. Steve, good to see you. Let's first talk about the context of U.S.-China relations, given that the Biden administration just really ramped up that trade war with tripist chip restrictions to China. What does Xi's continued rule mean for U.S.-China relations? Well, I think it means that we're at an inflection point. And Xi Jinping is reading the global map as one in which he sees America in strategic contraction. That made it feel differently than how we see things in Washington or New York, but that's what he sees. And he sees this as a time when China's got to get back to ideological purity, back to the territorial reacquisition of parts of China that had previously been with it, like Taiwan. And that part of the message here is that while Deng Xiaoping, a previous Chinese leader said, it's good for China to be rich. Well now China is rich and it's going to get back to ideology. And that is very uncomfortable for markets and many of the transnational firms that are based there. From a U.S.-China perspective, it means competition and challenge are coming. If we're not already in it actually, it's going to be a fight over standards. And we're going to be fighting over that rising global middle class in the world. Steve, you mentioned the reaction that we're seeing in the markets and markets are certainly taking this news very hard. You look no further than some of the largest U.S.-listed Chinese companies in terms of that reaction today. Do you think that's justified? Well, I think it's, you know, I think markets fall when there's not trust in the future and there's doubt. And I think there's a lot of doubt right now on how much Xi Jinping is going to be friendly to this. Look, we all have this view. And I did two at one point, a couple of decades ago, that the more China got interwoven into the world trade organization became dependent on Chinese trade, held U.S. debt, that it would become a better stakeholder in world affairs. Well, it turns out that equation has some wobbliness to it. And I think right now it looks like China is not going to be, you know, increasingly like us or the West. It's going to set standards in a new and different way. And right now it's one of the reasons it explains why Xi Jinping is so focused on consolidating power. He does not want to be challenged. He knows it's going to be rough. And he's going to be asking his people for a lot of sacrifices as he basically takes on the West, in my view, for more leadership in world affairs and more consolidation within China. None of those are friendly to markets. He has cracked down on big tech leaders there in China, our prior guest Linda Düsseld, essentially said he does not care about the economy in the short term. Can you put that in context for us? How a president would not care about the growth of their economy? Well, I think right now he has been focused on corruption. He's been focused on other elements. And you know, at one level, you know, Xi Jinping has this theory of what he calls great power relations or what it means for China to be great on the world stage. And that does not mean making Ali Baba rich. That means taking the power and assets of China, which he thinks are awesome and basically throwing all of his support behind that. They use that to changing the economy of the People's Republic, depending on the economicization of the interests.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,74,2022-10-24 19:17:52
3993," in Alling Boba Rich. That means taking the power and assets of China, which he thinks are awesome, and basically throwing all of his support behind that. But he's a bit disdainful that China's power is dependent upon its assets and markets being managed all around the world. I saw him in Davos a few years ago, and this was right when the Trump administration that came in and he gave a remarkable speech in which he said, don't worry, world. I'm going to be the one to protect markets and the market trading system in the world, and I'm going to be the one to save us all from climate change. And it turns out that part one, he's not living up to. So when you take a look at the fact that Xi Jinping has been so strict when it comes to COVID, the number of the COVID zero policy, the number of lockdowns that have been instituted in China over the last two and a half years. I guess though, at what point will he need to start listening to the Chinese people, those that are sick of these types of policies? And we're obviously seeing that play out in the economy today. Well, it's really interesting because he's just elevated a number of people that were responsible for that policy. So I don't predict any real weakening of that. And I think it's going to be complicated for China as it tries to reopen next year. I mean, I think we have to be very careful of mirror imaging with China that we would say, don't they want to risk back? Don't they want their people back? Don't they want to have all of the benefits that come with transnational traveling, exchange, and tourism, sure at one level they do. But the obsession with state control, the obsession with making sure, now you have to understand by basically shutting China off, it's also become much, much more vulnerable to a future variant or something. You do not have the antibodies, the natural immunity that has built up in places that have been hit hard by COVID. So to some degree, China's got a staggering problem ahead in that it is basically created a Galapagos island problem for itself, where its own population is now less prepared for a future variant from COVID than it might have otherwise been. And I don't know how they'll handle that. All I know is that this is a person very, very comfortable with asserting a lot of control over people's lives. That's good stuff. What does the third term mean for Taiwan? And if they're to take Taiwan, they do it by force, they do it by economic blockade. Or look, I think that we have to be careful with Taiwan. I do think there are things that we could do or they could do that could trip us into war and it would be a very, very nasty war. And there are geographic realities with Taiwan that are very complex. But look, I think that China is of the view that its incremental growth, the increasing investment it's made in its military power, its naval power, it's looking at how it is focused on what it could do by way of a blockade and others. I think we have to be very careful. And remember, the Taiwanese themselves may not, in fact, want this show down. Some do, but some don't. And I think we need to make sure that they're in the picture. 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors come from Taiwan. China wants it back, but I think right now, we're basically trying to figure out, is the era of strategic ambiguity over Taiwan, which has actually been stable. Is that coming to an end? And this is one of the areas that could lead to an actual kinetic collision between American forces and Chinese forces if we're not careful. And I think it is one of the real hot points in the world. And I think Taiwan is in a vice between them. And we don't have many Henry Kissinger's around to kind of put this deal back together. No, we do not. Speaking of competition, Steve, wanted to hear about your outlet, Semaphore. It's an interesting tech play. I'm just curious how you guys position yourself in an increasingly competitive media environment. Look, we love all of our sibling organizations are out there working in the new media space. We launched about a week ago. We had, I think, largely really good reception from across all the verticals we're doing. I help anchor and host the politics and policy division called Principles, so if they'll be to sign up. But look, the big thing we're trying to say is there is a crisis out there in trust and confidence in news. It's also a market opportunity, honestly. And if we can come back to educating and interacting with the American public and the global public, frankly. And say, it's important to hear Steve Clemens' views on things perhaps, or my analysis of the news or scoop. But I've got to be responsible to the fact that there are alternative views and opinions out there. And we build that in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,75,2022-10-24 19:21:57
3994," It's important to hear Steve Clements' views on things, perhaps, or my analysis of the news or scoop. But I've got to be responsible to the fact that there are alternative views and opinions out there. And we build that in. We build in a disagreement. We build in international perspectives into what we're doing. We show people that you can look at the facts and the scoop out there, but you can get a lot of different views out there and you should demand it and expect it in your media. And that is not, as you know, what is typically happening. You're able to do it in the broadcast format much, much better than the typical print and journalism world that we're in. And so by building in alternative reviews, by building this in, I think we'll have a richer and more trusted news formed down the road. And I look, you know, I encourage people to check us out. Steve, you're talking to a guy who worked at Fox News and CNN, man. So I get it. And I appreciate very much what you are doing. Thank you. We do look forward to following some of them. Of course, I'm a feeling we will be talking much more about that in the future. Steve, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Well, come here next, earning season, kicking into high gear. Up next, we're going to take a look beyond profit and revenue. Instead, focus on what company leaders are saying about the economy and market moves. We got that for you next. Joe, does ease that've still just won I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. I'm going to do a little bit of this. The biggest earnings week of the quarter is upon us with more than a third of S&P 500 companies reporting an almost half of the market cap. What have we learned thus far though about the direction of the economy, the strength and the dollar, and the health and the consumer? Scott Kraseloff is the transcript editor and founder of Avondale Asset Management. Scott, go to CL. Let's start before we dive into specific statements thematically. What have we learned thus far? What have we heard from our business leaders? I think that right now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,76,2022-10-24 19:26:14
3995," dive into specific statements thematically. What have we learned thus far? What have we heard from our business leaders? Yeah, I think that right now, business leaders are really focused, obviously, on the prospects of recession. And people are watching that very closely. See, looking for signs whether or not the economy is tilting into a recession. What we're seeing so far, though, is that consumer spending is held in really strongly. You're hearing from banks, especially at the beginning of the earning season, that consumers are still spending, that consumer spending is up, double digits still year over year. And so there's strength in the economy at the most fundamental level, which is the consumer. And yet you have deteriorating company confidence, I think among the CEOs, thinking that they need to be preparing for a recession. So at a high level, that's what we're really saying right now. It's gotten to that point. I want to bring up what Goldman Sachs, a CEO, David Solomon, did say shortly after the earnings were released. He said, on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States, comparing that to what we've heard from other bank CEOs, other executives. How does it stack up just in terms of the likelihood that we will see a significant slowdown? Yeah, that's a great question. I think David Solomon has probably been on the more bearish end of CEOs, bank CEOs, especially for the last several quarters. I think that it's easier to find a more negative comment from David than from some of the other ones. Obviously, Jamie Diamond has been notably bearish talking about a hurricane, could be coming through the economy. And I would say that Brian Moynihan has been on the most bullish side at Bank of America, of any of the bank CEOs. And that has proven the same case during this earnings season as well. So Brian Moynihan was one who reminded that the consumer is still very strong, relatively Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan CEO's, David Solomon and Jamie Diamond were both a little bit more bearish. And I would say that David Solomon has been the most cautious of anybody, which maybe isn't too surprising because Goldman Sachs obvious has the largest capital markets business of those three, whereas Bank of America would be touching consumers more directly. Right, right. It's not just their interpretation. Some of them certainly have different business models. So let's move over to the consumer and what we're learning from them. Here's the MX CEO. We're confident. Look, the spending speaks for itself. I mean, just look at some of these numbers. You've got goods and services up 16%. Our US consumer is up 22%. Millennial spending is up 39%. Our teeny spending is up 57%. International spending is 37%. We haven't seen any change. And you can look at this quarter over quarter. And the reality is that S quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending. And this is like a billion dollars behind or something like that. But if you look at year over year growth, we're not seeing any changes in consumer spending behavior at all. A remarkable statement given inflation. Was that an outlier statement or does it really sum up what we're hearing? No, I think it sums up honestly with what we're hearing from consumer credit card companies, especially, which is really the most important indicator because credit card companies are obviously seeing all of the spend that consumers are doing, not just in certain categories. And the numbers that they're seeing are significant. So you heard an American Express talk about double-digit increases in some major categories. And so I think what's important and why we focus on what's going on at the credit card spending company or the companies with credit card data is that in some of the other areas of the consumer sector, we're seeing slowdown. And you're seeing this shift from goods back to services that's still playing out post-pandemic. And the card companies are capturing all of that. But if you just listen to certain segments, you may see decline in goods spending or boosts in service spending. But the card companies are encapsulating all of that. It's got another big theme, obviously, is the strong dollar. We've heard it not only this quarter, but of course over the past several quarters when you take a look at the dollars jump up nearly 17% this year alone. I want to play a quick clip from what we heard on Netflix's earnings call after their results. The FX drag is significant. We mentioned in the letter if we look at our, you can do the math on our.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,77,2022-10-24 19:30:38
3996," If again, we mentioned in the letter, if we look at, you know, our, you can do the math on our four quarters now and you kind of roll it out to a full year number. We're still holding to what we're calling FX neutral to the beginning of the year, January one of this year to that 19 to 20% margin range FX neutral. You can, you'll see it's actually is in the mid to higher end of that range. But on a reported basis, it's just a little over 17%. So there's about two and a half points of FX drag in our margin that equates to about it's about a billion dollars of revenue drag about 800 million dollars of of margin drag. And that was Netflix, a CFO Spencer Newman. And Scott, we've heard it from a number of executives, IBM, one of the big companies obviously outwiring about the strong dollar their CFO saying it's a big wild card to what's going to happen to the US dollar, obviously having a huge impact on their business. I'm sure we'll hear it more this week when we hear from some of the larger tech giants. What's on your radar as we look out over the next couple weeks when it comes to the strong dollar. Yeah, I mean, I think the strong dollar is one component, one major component that's impacting earnings growth in this quarter. And I think that's one of the big things that we're seeing this quarter versus previous quarters is that you're really starting to see earnings growth get impacted by some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in the economy. So the dollar is one and Netflix pointed out there. Proctor and Gamble also talked about a nine point headwind just from currency in its most recent quarter. But then also proctor and Gamble talked about a 27 point overall earnings growth headwind, which again, 27 points, a massive number in terms of the growth headwind. And that was not just in terms of strong dollar, but that was also just the general inflation area environment, both in terms of their input costs and then also their free delivery costs. And so those things, you know, that what we've been talking about thematically and markets and capital markets for a long time, I think are starting to actually hit the financial statements of companies in this quarter. And that's that's really important for two reasons. Not only is it it's it's impacting and showing where the economy is going. But as we think about what multiples to give to stocks to equities and ability to repay debt for companies as well, capital markets can get get impacted further lag here by by decreasing earnings and some of these dynamics finally flowing through. Alright, that's great stuff. The transcript editor and avidale asset management founder Scott Kraseloff, appreciate it man. Thanks. I hope you enjoyed the details for your next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,78,2022-10-24 19:35:17
3997," What are you doing, D winner? I'm going to make sure to break everything down. I'm going to have friends. Yeah, you're having a hard time, he's just sitting there. Do you remember what's going to happen, Ed? Anyway, they're really-, This time for our triple play, three stocks that were watching in the final 25 minutes of trading. We have Starbucks, Atesla and Las Vegas, San's, Jareblicrate on set to help us break down some of these movers. All right, let's start with my pick and that is Starbucks. Shares falling today. One more that China president as Xi Jinping's tighter control is going to lead to the continuation of the COVID-0 approach. The drop today, early on a drop of just around 5% now earlier in the day with the largest single drop that we have seen, single day drop that we have seen in nearly a year. China is a critical market for Starbucks. We've heard that many times from the company that has more than 50s of 100 stores in the region. Shares year to date well in the red. Things are going to be paying very close attention to any further detail that we get on the earnings call from Starbucks next week just in terms of their China business. What this could potentially mean for Starbucks over the coming months. And Jareb, when you take a look at that year-to-day chart, you're looking at shares firmly in the red and we know that it has been a stock that has struggled not only overseas but of course with the sewing economy here in the US too. Yes, and I want to go to the Wi-Fi Interactive where I have the Nasdaq 100 daily heat map here and look at all that nice screen except for the bottom. And I like how all of our picks today are basically around the same theme which is weakness in China because of that big consolidation of power. Here's Starbucks over the last 20 years. Now I just want to show you it's still, here's the good news for the bulls. Let me see if I can draw this trend line ever so haphazardly. But still, I guess on the right side of this trend line, although we have had a very, very big decline here. But in the same vein, I do want to highlight some of the Chinese stocks that are suffering as a result of the weekend action and notably Tesla is going to be among them. Now that is of course a US stock. You can see all that red in your page. I want to go to Tesla now which also has some other news. It lowered the price of its Model 3 in China. By about 5%, you can pick one up for about 37,600. Now over the last year, look at the price action and you can see that is from the upper left to the lower right. It has now exceeded to the downside these lows that we had earlier in the year. So right now, perch at a pretty precarious level, I would say here's a three year chart and you can see now in danger of violating this really big what might be considered a topping formation here. If that is a topping formation, considerable downside remains. However, if it were to launch from here, given all this price history around let's say 170 to 175, 200, could mark a bottom. But only price action can tell Dave. Still let's talk to it was down 47% year to date prior to this news out of China. So you think a lot of the bad news is already baked in there. I've just had a little counter story. Reuters reporting today in Toyota may entirely retool their entire EV program with sites set on catching Tesla. But literally going back to the drawing board which is a fascinating development there. And because we've got a triple play of China's related stocks, mine is LVS, Las Vegas Sands. LVS currently a trending ticker on Yahoo Finance, the stock folding on Xi Jinping securing a third term as Chinese president. This implies a continuation of those strict COVID-19 policies that's proven ruinous for many of these businesses. In particular, the Macau casinos earlier today, officials in the Economic Center of Guangzhou announced that all schools and restaurants will be closed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,79,2022-10-24 19:39:33
3998," Many of these businesses, in particular the Macau casinos earlier today, officials in the Economic Center of Guangzhou announced that all schools and restaurants would be closed to control the sudden rise of positive cases, really a confirmation of the widely held COVID-0 fears. Las Vegas Sands reported third quarter earnings last week, beating revenue expectations. Today, however, shares down 10 percent, though that is climbed back quite a bit from what they were down earlier. And when is also climbed back, some of their losses down less than 4 percent now. They were report Q3 earnings, November 9th, China. Yeah, Dave, I mean it's a worse performer among the peers. We know their exposure because of Macau. How critical that is to their business. We're seeing that reflected in this stock today. What was surprising to me though, when you take a look at analyst ratings on the stock, there is 12 buys, two holds and no sell ratings. So you could, I guess you could make sense if you're taking a look at it from a valuation perspective and that year-to-date drop. But when you take a look at the fact that it's going to be a pretty challenging couple of quarters, maybe ahead for this company, I want to be surprised if maybe we see some downward revisions here over the coming weeks. All right, coming up next, we are looking ahead to a big week for tech, the implications from snaps, disappointing results. What that means for the rest of the sector, mefster. Alright, here's a quick comment, right? Good using the ES Sauce content? Excellent. All right. The price war is in streaming heating up Apple, the latest company to make a change to its strategy, raising the price for Apple TV Plus and Apple Music. Now, the price of Apple TV Plus will now cost $6.99 a month from $4.99. Apple Music is going to go up to $10.99 from $9.99 per month. The company is saying licensing costs are the reason for the increase in rates. It's part of a broader trend that we're seeing across the space, especially in this inflationary environment. Netflix and Disney both raising prices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,80,2022-10-24 19:43:59
3999," for the increase in rates and it's part of a broader trend that we're seeing across the space especially in this inflationary environment. Netflix and Disney both raising prices earlier this year and now both are launching lower tier ad supported packages as well. Apple shares today taking a look at that move is still in the green up just around 1.6%. Well, let's talk about this announcement from Apple and also what we're expecting to hear from some of the earnings from the big tech companies over the next couple of days. And for that, we want to bring in Dan Morgan. He is a centenuous trust a senior portfolio manager. Dan, it's great to see you. So first is your reaction to Apple raising prices here. I think was largely expected. A lot of people were waiting for when they were going to do so. But what do you make of it from an analyst perspective? Well, I mean, it's a very competitive environment and they're trying to offset some of the things that are happening with some of the competitors that you mentioned. We had Netflix last week. We know they're going to an ad tier model. We know Disney is already on one. So it's not surprising that Apple is trying to do what they can to try to leverage that unit. It's not a big part of their business. It's a component in their service side. But it is something that they've been working on to try to grow over a period of time. Dan, of course, it is a huge earnings week. Apple among them reporting, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, you name it just about all the big heavy weights. And the question being as we lead in is what have we learned from SNAP? Does there issue more of a SNAP problem or an entire environment problem? They're now down more than 80% year to date, although interestingly, back up 8% today. So what did we learn from SNAP that we'll see later in the week? Dave, I think the SNAP report came in overall ad revenues, which is basically their revenue component was up 6%. They did beat and daily average users. But it does give us a window into obviously Meta, we're expecting them to report about a 5% drop in ad revenues. We've got Alphabet coming in tomorrow. They're expected to report about a 6% growth rate in ad revenues, very similar to SNAP. And then it rolls into other companies like Twitter. You've got Amazon and so forth in the ad revenue space. So I think it is an indication and it basically just gives more evidence that we continue to see a slow down in terms of ad spend on the internet. I think you're going to see those reflective in both Alphabet and Meta's numbers on Tuesday and Wednesday. And then speaking of Meta Bank of America downgrading the stock today, in part due to that pullback that we would likely see in advertising spending, what that could mean here for the company going forward. Year to date, the stock is off just over 60%. They certainly had a hard time selling their metaverse vision to Wall Street. What needs to happen in order for Wall Street to get on board with Meta's vision? What's a tough vision, Shawna, because we know they switched the reporting segments around a couple quarters ago. They have their reality labs group. They're very big on their virtual reality headgear. They're trying to put a lot into that. You talked about the movement towards metaverse. And you know what? We just don't know if that's going to pay off, right? We know what their bread and butter is. It's selling advertising over the internet. It's keeping people engaged, it's increasing their monthly and daily average users. So Wall Street just got to kind of embrace going forward whether this strategy is going to pay off. And you know, let's face it, Meta is not in the same position that AlphaBet it is. They don't have a GCP. They don't have an entry in the data center space. So it's a big question, guys, whether this is going to pay off for them or they are just going to kind of slowly go down as ad spend rates deaccelerate. Any collateral damage to AlphaBet and the stories that we've talked about? What are your expectations for them this week? Just the snap report, obviously rolling in, but I would expect good things in regards to their GCP business. Data center should be strong. AWS should grow 30%. We're looking for GCP at about 33%. Azer which is Microsoft, that should go up about 43%. We know that they've had some struggles with their YouTube franchise, the last two quarters, competition from TikTok, also privacy rule changes with iOS. But if they can leverage their GCP business to try to offset some of that slower demand in terms of ad revenues, they should come out okay. And hopefully post revenues about 10% growth. Live it a week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,81,2022-10-24 19:48:00
4000," to try to offset some of that slower demand in terms of ad revenues, they should come out okay and hopefully post revenues of about 10 percent growth. Pivotal week in Big Tech, Dan Morgan, thanks so much for your analysis, appreciate all that. All right, what are the limits of cancel culture? With every passing day and every deplorable anti-Semitic comment, Kanye West is testing its limits to the Italian agency CIA, cutting ties with Kanye, fashion powerhouse Balenciaga, did the same last week, Kanye ended his deal with Gap last month, Gap Brands decided to quote, wind down at the partnership in their eyes because their vision was not aligned. What about Adidas though? That is the question, the hashtag boycottadidas is spreading on social media, but still nothing from the global shoe giant that's home to Yeezy Steakers. Kanye said recently on a podcast, I can say anti-Semitic things and Adidas can't drop me and quote, why can't they drop them? Well, if that's the truth, it's because Morningstar analyst David Schwartz estimates Yeezy sales are around $2 billion annually. That is 10 percent of Adidas sales. So Shana, it's easy to sit here in this seat on the financial journalist side of things and say, you have to cut ties with someone making these disgusting, deplorable comments day after day, but it ain't that easy when you're the CEO, when you're sitting in the C-suite and you know Yeezy Steakers are your window into a demographic you cannot otherwise touch, let alone 10 percent of your sales. I guess you can make that argument for now. One, I do think this backlash is going to pick up. I think Adidas is already under a tremendous amount of pressure to sever their ties with Kanye West. I am surprised that they haven't been more outspoken about this issue. The only thing that they have said is that their partnership is under review. And that was a couple of weeks ago. We've heard that Kanye West continued to make these types of antisemitic comments over the past couple of weeks here in terms of what this could mean for sales. I know you don't agree with me on this, but I would not be surprised if we do see a drop off in these sales of Kanye's, of Yeezy Shows when it comes to Adidas. Yes, right now the Morningstar analyst estimated that it makes up about 10 percent of Adidas's sales. Cowan was out with another estimate more recently saying that they expected to be around 8 percent of Adidas's sales. But maybe we will see the consumers speak up and the consumer no longer willing to buy Yeezy's brand, willing to spend the money on his products. And of course that could also have a massive impact on Adidas. If in fact they do sit there and do nothing. Don't get me wrong. I hope you're right. I know. I fear you're wrong. I do have a window into Yeezy buyers, the teenagers that I know still love these sneakers. They are not as socially conscious as you might hope. They are teenagers. They are busy and these sneakers are a status symbol whether we like it or not. Now hopefully the pressure comes from the private sector and there are forced to do something, at least say something, Adidas, that you condemn these morally reprehensible comments. If you're not going to sever said relationship, that deal goes through 2026. It's got a lot of legs left on it. A lot of people stop buying these sneakers, they just came out with the new color and the past couple of days I'm not entirely sold on that. But it will be one of the biggest stories in business in the weeks ahead. Coming up, we're learning more about the US Amoxicillin shortage that details after the break. Bye.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,82,2022-10-24 19:52:32
4001," GLORIA. three of the top four makers of a Moxasillian are reporting a supply shortages across the US Yahoo finances. Angela Kim Lonnie's been following the story for us and on what's the latest? That's right, Chana. As we know last week, we started off with just a select shortages in certain pharmacies, but it's grown to a little bit of still a sporadic but nationwide shortage of a Moxasillian specifically the doses that are needed in liquid form for children. So the pediatric use of this drug that anti-bacterial there. We're looking at, sorry, antibiotic. We're looking at specifically the makers, Hickma, Tava and Sandos, which is a Novartis company. All three of those are the ones that have reported shortages or shortages have been reported for them either by the FDA or other sources. And while there is efforts to sort of plug the holes there are, like the antibiotic situation where, for example, CBS has reported shortages, but Walmart has not. So it is quite a mixed bag of a situation right now, and we know that at least the regulatory body is keeping an eye on it. And the backstory is a little bit of what you might expect with, you know, all the world situation right now where it comes to supply chain issues, raw material shortages and the like and high energy costs all really much more than the market situation. As I said right now, still sporadic situation, but keeping an eye on it. All right, Audrey also the recent spike in RSV cases has been alarming in particular with children's hospitals. And I went hard for Connecticut. And absolute tobacco. What's the latest? That's right. You're hearing about pediatric hospitals filling up and needing beds. This is something that is kind of like the most important thing in the world. And I think that we're seeing in the with the same level of aggression and does affect individuals we've seen annually on average 58,000 hospitalization in kids and roughly 100 to 150 deaths reported each year. And that is the concern health experts have been warning about what could be a tri-demic this winter and we're already starting to see it a little bit with the RSV as well as the health care system. And the danger for kids, of course, under five is that this can present just like COVID as well as flew. So it is hard to figure out with an at home test. There is no at home test for that right now. And it's one of those things that's really pressuring the health care system as we speak.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,83,2022-10-24 19:57:11

Certainly an alarming surge in the number of cases. And Angelica Mlani, thanks so much. Well, coming up, we are counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. You're still looking at gains across the board. Dow of 376 points, S&B Nasdaq also in the green. We'll be right back. That's enough. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. I'm going to do a little bit more of this. We're just minutes away from the closing bell. Let's bring in a Jared Blyckery for a closer look at some of the gains that we're seeing this afternoon. That's right, Sean. We have the Dow leading the way. That's up 1.3%, roughly, SMB 500, a little bit less. Nasdaq lagging. It's up about 8% of a percent. We're not for the route in Chinese stocks. I think it would be a bit higher. We'll get to that in a second. First, we want to check out our sector action. Healthcare is still in the lead here, followed by staples, tech, industrials, financials. All of those outperforming. All of those up more than 1% to the downside. Materials in real estate. Those are the only two in the red. Let me just check out some of our leaders here to the upside. The transports, that is the top spot, DJT, rocking in about 3% today, followed by homebuilders, retail and value stocks. Also momentum outperforming. All of those above the SMB 500 to the downside. Guess what stands out? K-web. That is a Chinese internet ETF. That is often astounding 14% emerging markets. A lot of that is China. That's down over 3% and cannabis stocks as well. Let's get straight to the action one more time before. It looks like we got less than 30 seconds to the bell. JD.com, down 13%, Pinduoduo, off about 1 quarter of its entire value. All of the above it down 12% there. Now, closing in on the other with the travel sector. We can see it's kind of a mix board here. Delta up 2% united. Delta up over 3.5%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,84,2022-10-24 20:01:03
4003," Now, closing in on the other with the travel sector, we can see it's kind of a mixboard here delta up 2% united up a workday in the half. Alright, that'll do it. There's your closing bell on Wall Street. Let's check out the markets as the Dow is Jared just told us solid rise 1.34% up more than 400 points. The NASDAQ has solid gained just under 1% for 93 points and the S&P up 1.2% after an incredible week, really up 4.7% last week the best week since June for a closer look at the broader markets. Let's bring in a Lestio DeLongis, Invest Go investment solution, Senior Portfolio Manager and Megan Horniman, Verdun's Capital Advisors Chief Investment Officer. Nice to see you both. Megan will start with you. What do you make of the rally that really persisted through last week? And continue today despite the macro outlook? I think there's a couple things. Keep in mind that we came into earning season with earnings being downgraded for the third quarter by a pretty significant amount. So, you know, any there I think there was a lot of the pessimism already priced in there and I think earnings have come in a little bit better than expected. And then when you look at economic data, yeah, this is kind of one of those stories where you know bad news can be good news. And the economic data has been pretty dismal and that has people now looking at possibly the Fed to slow down in their interest rate hikes, possibly as early as December. Well, let's say what do you think of the gains that we've seen recently coming off the best week that we've had since June pushing further to the upside today? Do you think these gains are going to last? Yeah, I agree with the assessment. I think these gains are largely reflecting expectations relative to sentiment going into earnings season, but the revisions and the guidance on future earnings are actually more more worrisome. So, as we have outlined in the past, we think this is a good opportunity to use these rallies to lighten up the risk in the portfolio and take advantage of to become a little bit more defensive. So, we don't expect these gains or at least these pace of gains to hold in the near future, but markets to resume a little bit more of a choppy high risk behavior. And Megan, we've had many a guests come on this program and say we think the S&P is going to fall 20% from here. What do you think is around the bend? Yeah, I don't necessarily think that we're going to see another 20% from here. Keep in mind that even though we've had a bit of a rally here recently, we were basically trading around the historical average that you tend to see with bear markets. So, we don't think we're going to fall another 20% from here. Can we go back and retest the lows for short? There's a lot of economic data coming out this week. There's a lot of earnings coming out this week. We have political uncertainty coming up with the midterm elections. So, there is a possibility that we'll see volatility, but keep in mind is well that volatility comes in both forms. And we're kind of seeing that lately. It can be volatility to the upside and volatility to the downside. So, in this situation, you've got to understand you're not going to be able to find in time perfectly the bottom of this bear market instead focus on the long term. And what we do tend to see is whether it's positive seasonality in the fourth quarter of a calendar year, or whether it's positive seasonality in the year after a midterm election. But I think that these are things that you have to take into consideration as you look for the long term and focus on what we've seen and what's pricing in that peak pessimism already. Let's say we just heard Megan quickly mentioned earnings. Let's talk about what we've seen so far because up until this point, we've had about 20% of the S&P that have reported earnings about 72% topping estimates. But we know that bar was set extremely low. I guess what's your assessment for of the result that we've gotten so far and what that could mean that we will likely see over the coming weeks? I think the results are encouraging, but they're also back we're looking and we shouldn't really put too much emphasis on them. The results for the summer months are yet to really reflect what is the perspective impact of the massive tightening in financial conditions and monetary policy that we have seen over the last few months as we know monetary policy operates with variable lags and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,85,2022-10-24 20:05:18
4004," massive tightening in financial conditions and monetary policy that we have seen over the last few months. As we know, monetary policy operates with variable lags. And so what is more important is to look at how earnings revisions are evolving. What is the guidance? And on that front, the news is a little bit more defensive, I would say. I think we need to prepare. We have been arguing for a using episodes like this quarter or this earning season to really move on with the rotation out of cyclicals into more defensive sectors of the market, be it healthcare, communication services, even information technology, high tech, mega companies tend to have more of a quality bias or not as cyclical as they used to be. But certainly a defensive orientation. And we think that the dynamic in bond yields should peak soon and provide some relief to these defensive sectors. And Megan, let's stay there with your, how do you position yourself given the situation ahead? Well, I think that I do agree with the guests that there is some room for downward revisions to earnings for next calendar year. I do agree with that, but I think that's going to be focused more in that high growth technology sector. I don't think that the interest rate increase that we've seen and the potential for the future interest rate increases is fully priced into those areas. So we would be careful with that growth technology side of the market. We think there's still some more room in what we consider price discovery there. Instead, we would look at obviously from the large cap space in the value area. And then also look at some areas of the market that have already priced in what we think is is going to be a volatile environment and a challenging economic environment. Look at small and big cap stocks. These areas of the market are still down 30, 40 percent from their 52 week high. These have priced in a lot of that downside. Plus, you've seen a pretty big decline in earnings expectations in those areas. So valuations, we think are very fair value and we would focus on those areas of the market. Let's quickly talk about the geopolitical risk. Because when you look over to Europe, the recession that's likely playing out over there, the uncertainty when it comes to the UK. And then the news today on China, obviously that's adding some uncertainty here to the markets. What's your assessment just in terms of how big of a risk that is potentially for US investors? Well, US investors have over the last decade enjoyed the benefit of the US being the lead, the leader in global markets performance. And that's been true everywhere. So that home bias has reflected itself. We don't see US investors having a outsized exposure to international stocks or emerging markets stocks. So from a wealth preservation standpoint, I think the direct exposure has been lower compared to say the pre-GFC time where there was really a ramp up in emerging markets, equities and fixed income exposure. We don't see that today. With that being said, emerging markets are always your best bell weather of the highest propensity to take risk in capital markets. When emerging markets suffer the way they do, it is a reminder that we don't see that the ampole liquidity support and unconditional propensity of investors to take risk. Investors are not seeking to increase risk in their portfolio. They're seeking to consolidate risk, especially when they see cash rates at 4%. Investment grade quality at 5% at 6%. I think this is a reminder of a catalyst of a gradual rotation out of equities into fixed income. Now the fixed income assets offer yields that we haven't seen in nearly 20 years. All right, let's say it's a longest and Megan Hurneman, thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, coming up next, the man said to be UK's new prime minister may also be the first major leader to be a crypto bull.

4005," vão The U.S.-South-E relations on the brink rising tensions between President Biden and Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, putting the longstanding relationship between the two countries at risk. We want to bring Yahoo Finance, senior columnist Rick Newman joining us now with the latest. Hey there, Rick. So even though relationship obviously between Saudi Arabia and U.S. not at the best, we are expected to see a number of U.S. business leaders make their trip to Saudi Arabia later this week. Right. This is a three day. It's kind of a business and networking event similar to the Davos event that we attend. This is focused on the Middle East. And the idea is to generate business activity, business deals, Saudi Arabia is trying to diversify its economy beyond fossil fuels. And that's part of why they kicked this off. This conference was not controversial until four years ago when we now know the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman ordered the execution and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Kashoggi in Turkey. And since then there's been a lot of pressure on Western companies and American companies in particular to basically boycott this event. But I guess that pressure is fading because we're going to see CEOs of many of the big U.S. banks and some other companies attending this event. And of course this comes as the United States has been asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to produce more oil to put pressure on Russia in its war on Ukraine, but they had said recently no, they're going to do the opposite. They're going to produce less oil. So that has generated a lot of apparent visible friction between Washington and Riyadh, President Biden said there will be consequences for Saudi Arabia, basically engineering this cut in production, but no word yet on what those consequences are. Meanwhile, there's a big business fet in Saudi Arabia. Yeah, the consequences we've heard a little bit about the potential for stopping arms sales to Saudis. I am guessing Lockheed Martin and Raytheon had a little something to say about that, but we don't know the behind the scenes, but these just aren't any executives. We're talking JP Morgan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,87,2022-10-24 20:14:26
4006," I am guessing Lockheed Martin and Raytheon had a little something to say about that, but we don't know the behind the scenes, but these just aren't any executives. We're talking JP Morgan, Goldman and Wells CEOs, Blackstone and Bridgewater CEOs, arguably some of the biggest in the world. But let's get back to oil. Has any of this back and forth, the OPEC plus move, changed the price of oil? Move the needle. Well, it's not a disaster for those of us in oil consuming nations. So I think when OPEC said it was going to cut production, there was an expectation that we'd see a bump in oil prices and we didn't. So if we did, it was very temporary. So last time I looked, what is oil around $82 a barrel? That's tolerable. I guess you could argue that if the Saudis and the other OPEC plus nations were continuing production at current levels. And remember, this is a gradual drop-off in production, not a one-time overnight drop-off. I guess we'd see oil prices lower. But President Biden has, he has been able to watch his gas prices, gasoline prices have fallen from $5 a gallon in June. They're now around $3.80. I mean, that is a dramatic improvement in gas prices. Of course, everybody would love for gasoline to be $1 per gallon, but we're never going to go back to those days. So I mean, this hasn't turned into like a crisis for Biden. I think it's just an irritant at this point. No doubt about that, but not apparently much sway with the big bank CEOs. I guess. At least not on paper right now. Rick Newman, good to see you, sir. Thank you. I guess. All right, incoming UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is the youngest PM in modern history. He's the first to do in first person of color to lead the UK. Will he also be the first crypto-bro leader, David Holler with here with that story? I know crypto-bro may not be the correct term, maybe it's crypto-bro, David, but is that the deal? Yeah, I mean, the former finance ministers, New Girl is leader of the UK's conservative party. Obviously, PAPES is way to becoming the Prime Minister. And this is interesting in the fact that just back in April, under as part of Boris Johnson's cabinet. Sunak proposed a series of initiatives to make the UK more crypto-friendly. This included sort of pushing forward a new law that would allow dollar pegs, stablecoins to be used in everyday payments and also asking the UK's royal mint to well, mint an NFT. And in preparation, he has actually met with members of the more of the venture community side of crypto. And also done round tables with other crypto companies such as asset manager, Bitwise, and Salona Labs. So we're looking at a politician here, I think, at the bare minimum, who has a lot more direct exposure to the crypto industry than say most world leaders. So this is obviously a very interesting development from that standpoint. It could potentially be very bullish here. Four crypto, at least in the longer term. What do you think, though, does this mean just in terms of the odds of making the UK a crypto hub? Yeah, I mean, I think, Sean, it's, you know, I think a lot of this does become a marketing thing, you know, where a country wants to sort of tout, you know, what they can do. We've seen this with, you know, smaller cities in the US, for example. And obviously, the US itself has also been pushing forward with crypto with Biden ever since Biden's executive order on cryptocurrency. But that being said, I think that really what the industry and regulators want to see is some sort of clarification on regulations. Now, whether those regulations are tougher or more friendly is sort of what it comes down to. And sort of taking a step back, Sunnack obviously is inheriting, you know, increasing financial stability concerns in the UK, you know, ever since we've seen trouble with the British pound. So I think right now, you know, it is, it might be a little bit early to expect any sort of, you know, extreme sort of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,88,2022-10-24 20:18:24
4007," So I think right now, it might be a little bit early to expect any extreme policy recoveries sort of of what he talked about back in April before the crypto market showed its own example of financial instability. But I think it's definitely on the menu down the line and it does build well for the UK more broadly in terms of its fintech industry. Yeah, given the recent crypto fall, I don't think now is the best time to be making risky plays after the 44 day interim Liz Truss term. So David Holler, interesting stuff though. We'll keep our eyes on that. Appreciate the story. Get your popcorn ready folks will break down black atoms performance at the box office this weekend. That's a big rock film. There he is.

4008," Fortability challenges really rain on buyers' budgets and sellers' decisions on whether or not to list their homes. We're going to continue to see affordability constraints and in constrained inventory throughout the next year in this housing market. Nicole, you just mentioned constrained inventory. I guess you don't expect that to improve anytime soon, taking a longer-term outlook maybe year to years, three years down the line. When do you expect to see that balance return when it comes to supply versus demand? Well, when we look at where inventory is at right now, we're not anywhere near where we were before the pandemic and I don't think we're going to get back to that point anytime soon. We're still seeing new construction at a higher level than it was pre-pandemic, but it's pulled back quite a bit from the 2021 highs when the construction market was really booming. Now that affordability has started to hit both buyers and sellers, we're seeing a lot of existing homeowners locked into their current interest rates. That's going to lead to lower new homes coming onto the market from those existing inventory stock. That's going to lead to more inventory constraints and with the large number of demand, the people who want to be buying homes, if those homes are affordable, that's not going anywhere. This constraint inventory is really what's going to be keeping affordability pressures on the market and keeping prices from dipping down too low. Some pretty dire predictions though about the expected fall of home prices, one from the National Association of Realtors said, 20% drop in home values next year. Are you buying that? I don't think we're going to see anything near those extreme levels of price drops. We're going to continue to see these small declines throughout the rest of this year as the rebalancing takes place. But again, because we're going to see such low levels of inventory, that will likely keep us from seeing too low of drops of those home prices. So, especially when we look at the fact that home values are still up over 40% from where they were in 2019 at this time in that year. And so, existing homeowners still have a huge swath of equity that they've gained over the last couple of years. And the majority of that is likely not going to go anywhere. So to be clear, when you say rebalancing, no one's going to lose value in their home compared to 2019 levels, just coming down a bit from record highs. Yeah, for the majority of markets, we're just going to see this kind of smoothing out from where we're at right now. And especially in terms of affordability, markets that have seen the biggest borsening of affordability, right? When you look at local incomes versus where mortgage rates are taking current mortgage payments, the markets where we see the biggest increase in that affordability burden, that's where we're going to see prices coming down the most. But it's not likely going to be anywhere near the amount of appreciation we've seen in the past two and a half years. Mortgage rates, of course, are the story of 30 or fixed right now, averaging 6, 9, 4, up slightly from the week prior, but more than double from a year prior. How high do you think they'll get? The Fed still has what appears to be a 75 point hike if not a 50 after that in December. And some field mortgage rates could eclipse 8%. Yeah, it's absolutely. It's very challenging to estimate where exactly we're going to see mortgage rates going. There are a lot of factors that influence mortgage rate changes. We know that rates are likely going to stay much higher than those pandemic error lows. And so we're not going to be expecting to return anywhere near 3% anytime soon. So when looking at the next couple of months to the next couple of years, we're likely looking at higher rates than we had when there was this big frenzied housing market. And we're likely not going to return to that because the supportability challenge is going to be existing. Even if rates went down to 5%, we're still going to see affordability challenges with current home prices. And if rates get any higher, affordability is going to be a major challenge for most households. So that's likely not going to change much as rates are fluctuating throughout this year. Do we see 8% or 5% first? Yeah, that's really hard to tell. I think rates are likely going to stick around the level that they're at now with minor fluctuations, but it's really difficult to pin that down. Yeah, more reliant on the 10 year than they are the exact correlation to Fed Hikes. Rent has been a different story. It appears we're seeing a little leveling out. What are you seeing in the data? Yes, so rents are definitely strong compared to where they were pre-pandemic. Even as the four sales side of the market is softening, we're still seeing rents being pretty strong in terms of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,90,2022-10-24 20:27:05
4009," Friends are definitely strong compared to where they were, you know, pre-pandemic. Even as the four sales side of the market is softening, we're still seeing rents being pretty strong in terms of rent growth and rent price levels. It's actually cheaper in most markets to rent than it is to pay for a monthly mortgage payment. And that's definitely weighing on people's decision-making of, you know, should I rent or should I buy? We're seeing a lot of people, you know, who are being priced out of the four- sale market, going back to rentals, and that's gonna boost demand for that market. We're seeing gluelow vacancy rates. We're seeing new construction builders switching over to multifamily properties, which will help reduce some of that burden. But it's likely that rent growth is gonna stay high, especially compared to the appreciation levels that we saw pre-pandemic. You know, we've got the biggest level of multifamily construction going on since the mid-1970s. So that is certainly a good rental news story. Are there sectors, regions of the country, or even cities, Nicole, that you think might not apply to that balancing out rule that might be actually a jeopardy of losing a lot of home value in the year ahead? What we're seeing is markets that have seen the biggest change in affordability over home prices are slowing down and dropping the most. That's mostly in the western half of the United States. Everything from Austin, which experience, you know, near 50% annual appreciation during the pandemic, over to Phoenix and San Francisco. All of those markets are seeing pretty significant declines in prices over the past couple of months. But again, nowhere near the level of appreciation that we saw since 2019. So even though we're seeing, you know, maybe 2% drops in Phoenix the last couple of months in a row, that's not eating into that 60% growth we've seen since 2019. Yeah, you just worry about those people that bought at the pandemic peaks and made some point realize they could be underwater. But hopefully we do not see that level in the cold, but show we really appreciate you being with us. Thank you so much ahead. All right, now let's talk to the box office, actually, roaring back in 2022. Thanks to movies like Top Gun Maverick and Minions, The Rise of Groo. Well, last weekend, Dwayne, The Rock, Johnson's new action movie, Black Adam also turned out to be a box office blowout. My son sacrificed his life to save me. Oh, my God! Oh, a fire! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Now, I kneel before no one. The Rock, our Yahoo Finance is Ali Canal here with us to talk about the weekend performance. Ali, I'm checking out Rotten Tomatoes. I don't know that I've ever seen a spread like this. The audience says 90% the critics say 39. How to do? Ooh, I know. And you know what? That's an interesting spread as well, because we've been seeing the critics be more harsh to some of these types of movies where the audience score tends to be a little higher. But overall though, pretty strong weekend, if we take a look at the numbers, Black Adam delivered a very big opening weekend, 67 million in its domestic debut. And the first film since July to top 50 million, this is great news for Warner Brothers, which has been really committed to reviving the DC franchise to better compete with Disney's Marvel franchise. And obviously, great news for The Rock as well. This film delivering his best domestic opening as a leading man, a long time coming from him. And according to the studio, premium formats. So I'm X screens, they accounted for about 44% of overall domestic ticket sales. So another sign when it comes to strong box office appetite as those types of tickets tend to be a bit more expensive. Now elsewhere at the box office, we had George Clooney and Julia Roberts ticket to Paradise. That's all domestic debut that topped 16 million bucks. Expectations were set in the low to mid teens. So another B on industry estimates there. Analysts that I've spoken with so that this romcom could have some potential staying power through the holidays, even through the end of this year as these types of films tend to play the long game when it comes to ticket sales. But obviously, as strong keys can be made, especially when we think about those reviews. And depending on the genre, of course, that you have an A-list star audiences are going to show up. Year to date, box office attendant levels are still down about 30% compared to pre-pandemic times. However, the amount of movies is also significantly down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,91,2022-10-24 20:31:27
4010," day box office attendant levels are still down about 30% compared to pre pandemic times. However, the amount of movies is also significantly down. So that's really important to think about. We just have a little more than one third of what we saw in 2019. And that's been the biggest uphill battle for theaters. And that's not going to really improve until 2023. We only have three big releases that will take us through the end of the year. We have Black Panther, while Conza forever that's out November 11th. Disney Strange World is out November 23rd. And then Avatar the way of water on December 16th. So those are the big three that are going to take us to 2023. But I don't think we're going to see that type of recovery that we want to until next year. Probably not. I'm looking forward to that George Clooney Julia Roberts. I'm a wrong confan, Ali. I have no problem admitting that. I'll see it. Ali, can I go to see you? Thank you. All right, more Americans are expected to take to the skies this holiday season. Is it too late to score a deal? Find out after the break. American or eager to travel. That's the clear takeaway from airline executive so far this quarter. And that willingness to spend doesn't seem to be slowing down at least anytime soon. Delta highlighted the strong appetite on its recent earnings call telling analysts that demand for the entire holiday period is quote very robust. American Airlines, a CFO, Derek Kerr echoed that same sentiment saying that quote, he doesn't see any signs of demand slowing down as we enter into the new year. So for more on this, and what we could expect from the travel industry going forward, we want to bring in Scott Kies, a founder of Scott's cheap flight. So Scott, the earnings calls that we've gotten so far, a lot of the largest US carriers very bullish about travel demand heading",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,92,2022-10-24 20:36:01
4011," Highs a founder of Scott's cheap flight. So Scott, the earnings calls that we've gotten so far, a lot of the largest US carriers, very bullish about travel demand heading into the holiday season even beyond into 2023. Is that consistent with what you're seeing on your site? Yeah, absolutely. Look, we're seeing a really, really strong amount of travel demand going forward into the holiday season. The number of people that are looking to take vacations or visit family and relatives is as high if not higher than it was pre-pandemic. And the reason why we still don't see passenger numbers quite at pre-pandemic levels is that business travel is still down about 25%. So the makeup of folks on a plane right now, which are actually fuller today than they were in 2019 because of fewer flights in the air, is skewed towards vacationers and leisure travelers and away from those business travelers. Are you talking business travelers? You talk leisure travelers, but we hear from all these CEOs is this blended travel concept. And I know some call it bleezer. Is that something you're able to track? You're able to see in the amount of demand? Yeah, look, I think there is some amount of bleezer that's happening today in a way that it hadn't pre-pandemic because it's so much more common or acceptable to be doing remote work, to be flying out on a Thursday, work on Thursday and Friday. And then have vacation in through your weekend. That is a kind of tested and proven model today in a way that it wasn't in 2018 or 2019. But the fact is still that airlines would far prefer to have a business traveler than a leisure traveler because business travelers tend to pay more for their flights. They will, you know, they're far more valuable than a given vacation traveler who purchases a ticket out of their own funds and therefore is more price sensitive. So even with the rise in bleezer travel, I still don't think that's an equal substitute for airlines from a business perspective. They're probably still losing out in that trade and still hoping for a more full recovery of business travel to come. And Scott, when you take a look at the rebound that we're seeing carriers are in a tough spot because they're having trouble adding to routes because of the labor shortage, also the plane shortages, adding some complications there. I guess from your assessment, are we seeing any improvement on this front? You know, gradual. It's a bit by bit piece by piece type of improvement because the fact is that pilots, not to mention all, you know, mechanics and other aspects of air travel that normally don't think much about, but pilots is not an entry level job. It's something that takes months, years of training, you know, tens, hundreds of thousands of dollars to go through the process and 1500 hours of cockpit time before you can be certified to fly commercial jets in the United States and that takes time to try to train up new pilots, especially given the thousands and thousands of pilot shortage that we are facing at the moment. And so like this is something that impacts smaller airports and more regional carriers more than folks in, let's say New York or LA or Chicago, but it has an impact across the board and is leading to higher fares today than we would have seen in a parallel universe where the number of pilots had kept pace with where we were heading on a pre-pandemic trend level. Yeah, fears are some of these smaller destinations will disappear entirely from some of the regional airlines. So you talk about fewer pilots and fewer planes, adds up to scarcity, how far our price is up, how much is inflation factoring in to the airline picture? Yeah, look, it is quite a bit compared to last year, 2021, it's up over 25% air fare levels. But when you zoom out a little bit further and adjust for inflation, it actually looks like it's basically in line with pre-pandemic trends when it comes to air fare that we have been on a gradual downward slide in overall air fare cost starting in around 2014, 2015. And it's just been gradually getting cheaper and cheaper on a real dollar basis. And so while it had quite a few swings over the past couple of years, really dropping in 2020, rising up pretty rapidly this spring, it seemed to have evened out now. And I think for the first time since the pandemic began, we can say that the outlook for...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,93,2022-10-24 20:40:02
4012," dropping in 2020, rising up pretty rapidly this spring. It seemed to have evened out now. And I think for the first time since the pandemic began, we can say that the outlook for airfare looks something basically normal. It looks pretty close to what we saw pre pandemic, which means that a lot of those winter holiday flights or peak summer flights are going to be in many cases eye-poppingly expensive. But that was the case in 2018 and 2019 as well. What a pros, Scott, you put it on a T for me. So it's holiday travel time. Is it too late to score yourself a deal? If not, how do we do it? So a couple thoughts here. It's not too late, but it's getting too late. Not you generally want to try to avoid last minute flights because they tend to be quite a bit more expensive, but not all last minute flights are equal. A flight booked a day before travel is almost certainly going to be more expensive than a flight booked a week before travel. And that's almost certainly going to be more expensive than a flight booked a month before travel. So you want to try to book sooner rather than later. You want to remember that last minute flights tend to go in one direction when it comes to prices and it's not down. But the other thing that I would add is that Thanksgiving, in particular, if you got the week off work or the kids are out of school, it is the hidden best week for international travel. Folks don't think of Thanksgiving as a cheap time to fly, but that's because most folks are traveling domestically where Thanksgiving is a big holiday. Internationally, it is not a holiday and late November is very much low season. That's what I took a look just before coming on. If you live in New York City right now, flights over Thanksgiving cost the same to fly to Milan in northern Italy, 548 bucks round trip, as it cost to fly to Fargo in North Dakota. I, nothing against the Midwest, I grew up there, I loved the place. I would rather spend Thanksgiving in Italy than in North Dakota. Oh man, Fargo's coming for you, Scott. I don't know. Italy, Fargo, I've been to Fargo. It's a nice place. Scott, Kai, good stuff. Scott's cheap flights. You're placed to find those last minute deals. Sean, I don't know. Fargo is coming for him. There it is. I think I'm with Scott on that one. I don't know if I'd say it though. I'm earning's beat for Italy. Exactly. All right, let's take a look at some of these act hours. Movers, we have four free. We have Twitter, Discover Financial, Qualtrics, and Cadence Design. Let's kick it off with Twitter, some breaking news here within the last just couple of minutes when asked whether the Biden administration is putting Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter under national security review White House press secretary, Karin Jean Pierre, replying that quote, we've heard those reporting those reporting are not true. We know that Elon Musk has until 5 p.m. Eastern time on Friday to complete his deal to buy Twitter or face a possible trial here. You can see Twitter closing the day up just over 3% over the last three months. If you take a look at that chart, you can see the stock up 29% year to date. We are still in the green. Up just around 9% 19% trading at 51, 52. And we know Musk's deal to buy Twitter was for 44 billion. So we're trading just below that 54 or 20 value. Let's take a look at Discover Financial Services moving to the downside here after hours and earnings miss is what's weighing on the stock EPS totally 354 during the quarter, the estimate out there or at least what the street was looking for was 377. Discover also saying that provision for credit losses totaled 773 million. The SMA was for 430 million. So make sure you think twice about maybe the slowdown that we will potentially see here in this quarter and then into next year. Take a look at Discover Financial year to date that stock off 17%. Let's take a look at Qualtrics International reporting better than expected quarterly results also raising their full year forecast. We're seeing that reflected after hours with the stock up just around 11% a strong sign here about the willingness of enterprise IT to spend at this point here today. It's a totally different story. You can see the stock off 70% over the past three months at least. It has performed okay. I guess we can say at this point as we take a look at the broader market but over the past three months Qualtrics off just around 14%. And wrapping up with cadence design systems another software play here that company boosting its full year adjusted EPS forecast also beating the street's estimates when it comes to earnings a dollar and six cents the estimate out there was for 97 cents over the past.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,94,2022-10-24 20:44:21

4014," is booming and sometimes scary face of that business is spirit Halloween. The National Retail Chain expanded this year to nearly 1500 stores and even to the silver screen with a new movie that hit theaters last month will show you that in a minute. We are seven days out from the big night and here with us spirit Halloween CEO Steven Silverstein. Steven, good to have you here. Really appreciate it. We are very big Halloween people, Sean. Nice to have you. We're very excited. We've got our plans. I'm just curious. How does one store come to dominate one holiday? I know mother's day belongs to hallmark and the like and maybe Valentine's day. But how did over your 20 years that you come to own this day? Because 20 years ago we identified and said this is what we do. We are so incredibly passionate about Halloween up and down and it's been the commitment of the entire organization to be building a brand. This is not just about a store. This is a story about a brand and a lifestyle. And Steven, speaking of that brand, obviously it's a very strong brand, a very recognizable brand this year. Like Dave just said, open a record 14 or 1,450 retail locations, hiring 35,000 associates doubling that retail presence that you've seen since 2009. Just give us your sense just on expanding in the brick and mortar space and how you're competing with some of those larger e-commerce players. Well, I like to say that you buy online but you shop in a store. What spirit provides in our brick and mortar format is a Halloween experience. You walk through the store you're enveloped. It's a sensory experience. We're coming at you every way we can. Sights and sounds and even smells and taste and touch. And it's a very engaging experience and that's what separates us from any kind of e-commerce experience. But the store itself goes that much further. I've always said if we could want it to charge admission, people would pay because the store is that much fun. And that's what spirit is all about. I've only been five times this year with my three kids. I assume tonight will probably make it six. You're not just an experience. You are a real estate play with those 14, 50 locations. What are you seeing in terms of vacancies, real estate prices? Are you moving away from malls and towards strip malls? What are you seeing in the real estate trends? Well, our choice location is always out actually in strip malls because we come back every year. It's really the visibility of the real estate that's probably most important to us. But as the brand has evolved, people are now starting to look for spirits. So we're getting a little more of an advantage there. But the reality is there's always been a vacancy in the real estate market, even during the paydays. Because once there was real estate was taken up, more would be built. So we're looking at the surplus real estate market and always have. The thing that makes us unique is that we're very flexible about the footprint that we can take. So we like the big box, but we'll take smaller boxes. We'll take car dealerships. We'll take movie theaters. We'll take furniture stores. Anything that really where we have the visibility and the location that work. And Steven, real quick, before we get into the hottest costumes of this season, are you able to find the workers that you need 35,000 seasonal workers? You know, one of the things we pride ourselves on is that we have a tremendous culture in our organization. People love Halloween. And there's this enthusiasm that takes place every year. And so there's an excitement about coming to work at Spirit Halloween because quite frankly, it's fun. And the other thing that I think of the mentality, we're sort of in the gig economy. You know, we're people who are doing lots of different things and then they come to us for a short period of time. And you would be surprised how often they come to us year after year after year. And quite frankly, it's a tremendous experience. And that's multiple times a year. Well, yeah. I mean, your session proves in every way what are speaking of the hot Halloween costumes on your streaming plays quite a big role in that this year. You know, everything influences Halloween costumes, right? Certainly the media, streaming, TV, movies are all part of the influences, but also things that are going on in our environment. And the way I'm looking at this year is kind of interesting, right? We're sort of in that post-COVID where all the reds come out for Halloween everywhere. And so in many ways, there's sort of a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,96,2022-10-24 20:53:04
4015," We're sort of in that post-COVID where all redies come out for Halloween everywhere. And so in many ways there's sort of a reversion to kind of classic Halloween ideas in genres. So what are the leading areas is classic horror licenses. So Chucky and Mike Myers, which is at Halloween Ends, right? That was the last one of that. Fred at Krueger, Friday the 13th, ghost face, scream. I just came out with scream seven or whatever it is. So there's a lot of that that is of great influence. But then of course you go on beyond that and you get into what you see on TV. You mentioned Yellowstone. Yellowstone. Yellowstone. Top Gun is out there, certainly creating us charge. But you know what? The real answers question, I'm asking this question so often. The answer to this question is the best Halloween costume is the one you want to be. And that's the beauty of Halloween. It's so many different places, so many different interpretations horror, it's humor, it's classic, it's fantasy, it's everything. Yeah, as long as you're creative then that is a good costume. That's the only one. See, what have you seen just pricing wise? Because we talk about so much how inflation is hitting nearly every aspect of our lives. Have you been forced to raise prices at all for the costumes this year? Well, the reality that says really impacted what we do is the supply chain. So in our case, you know, that's been, we've seen a real shock. And since we are seasonal retailer, I don't react well to shocks. We're here for the long term. So the reality is we did not take significant price changes this year because that shock is not something that's long term in nature. And I think most of that's going to be coming back to us next year. So we've heard of held the line to the extent that we can. What do you got for me? I saw you bring presents, you got a costume over here. I have presents. I'm inspired. I'm inspired by, I know what your personal interests are. And this is completely unique to you. But we have, we have Dr. Greenweez for you in your pro cannabis. Oh my goodness. You did, Steven did his homework. Wow. That's a creative one. You got one for me? Yeah, for you. For you. And you're going to look lovely. You will look lovely and be the bell of the wall. And the keyly Jones from Ted Blossom. Oh, okay. I actually love Ted Lasso. One of the few shows that I have watched recently. That is beautiful. I like this one. But, but we also, we don't want to leave your family out of this. And family is a very important to Halloween, right? So for your kids, we have the very popular, bluey. Bluey. They have blue. They do. They do. Bluey. They are too old. Oh, bluey is. Oh, you don't? It's a great show. It's actually pretty entertaining for the parents too. I have to tell you. See, Barry, are you going to be dressing up this year? I really should. You don't, man. You're all right. I will now. I will now. I will now. I will now. You don't wait until Saturday. That's a bad idea. Yeah. I know. Everything's going to be sold out. All right, Steven Silverstein. Thanks so much for having on with us. We really appreciate it. All right. We'll be right back. You don't. Thank you so much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_oQWsK-sM4,97,2022-10-24 20:57:58

4020, such promise and Weber. I had an interesting story to tell to investors when it came public. I lost so many people during the pandemic picked up and went and bought homes and many for the first time and they needed a grill or they wanted a grill so they bought out there and bought a Weber. So they saw a lot of demand there as well. Here's some yellow finance analysis on why this deal is probably getting served up. Post COVID results for Weber have been dreadful. Their longtime CEO recently left a couple months ago so the news has not been good. A lot of people now that they bought the grill during the pandemic they have not been going out there to buy a new grill. If you bought one a year and a half ago you do not need a new grill right now. Also strong U.S. manufacturing presence for Weber. When you compare Weber to its longtime rival Trigger Weber gets real high marks for having a lot of its manufacturing. Good chunk of it actually here in the United States where Trigger is that is not necessarily the case. They rely a lot more on China. Strong brand name. Everybody knows Weber has been around for decades. Largest player in the space with very very large deals of course with the likes of Home Depot lows and many other distribution outfits. And then lastly more millennials are owning homes. I know the rise in interest rates might shut a lot of millennials out but longer term. It's almost our time to start buying a house and we will need some form of grill and the likely two choices are going to be a Weber or Trigger. Now this comes and this is a good point by our friend Simeon Segal over at BMO Capital Markets. This is just the latest in a string of deals of upstart companies. You have at home group recently acquired you have Casper acquired you have. I won't put I robot in a in the upstart category but it was recently bought by Amazon. But you're starting to see big companies and big financial sponsors kick tires and some of these brands with strong names that have just been routed here in the market. So that is very interesting to see I do suspect you will see more deals and that is of course my take. You have a lot of companies sitting on a lot of excess capital whether it is financial sponsors they have to put this money to work and why not put it to work on a company like Weber with a strong name. And likely a strong long long term outlook once they get past you know the recent challenges. Yeah a lot of strong household names that you were mentioning there in the deal making ether right now beyond meat sausage right there. No. No. Cooking for broke to palm are beyond meat meat reporter. Okay. I'm not touching the beyond meat today but I think for some of the grills that have been bought or have not been bought it's only have not been bought side right now with the replenishment rate that we need to think about too because a lot of their whole government know as well. Look at that girl. Plottersweet rate again. The replenishment rate of your body. Wow. Yes. You can call it. You can call it. We were discussing it with Simeon Seagull. Yes. So with regards to the wholesale partners that they rely on to get these grills into stores if you have stores that are saying hey look people just aren't buying the grills. So we don't need to place an order for more but it's all of the tertiary products around that experience that Weber Trigger you can expect in the leaner. I am giving you power over that name. You create as far as I'm concerned you created that is the grill replenishment rate Brad. It's all yours. I will not I will not push back. Put Dr. LinkedIn profile credit. We're going to get a pulse check on the state of the consumer. We're breaking down consumer confidence on the other side plus UPS delivers the CFO of the region joins us to break down that company's report. That's an interview that you do not want to miss.

4021," 1 foot Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saozi alongside Brad Smith, Julie Heiming. As the day off, it has been an earnings heavy morning, but let's lock in on some breaking news crossing the wires just about right now as you're seeing all three markets up higher on this. That is consumer confidence, Brad, coming in from the conference board. Yeah, that's right. 102.5 is the reading that we just had come in from the conference board here. And as we're continuing to look through some of the data and get it all refreshed on our side, this is particularly interesting to see how the markets will react to this as we move on throughout the rest of the day right now. The Dow Jones industrial leverage is still seeing that hold on to gains still net positive by about half percent a little bit more than that. The S&P 500 still holding on to gains. That's up by about nine tenths of a percent. And the Nasdaq composite that's been the leader largely throughout the day here. And that's up by about one and a half percent at this point in time. But again, consumer confidence coming in at a reading of 102.5 here this morning. But we're going to continue to see if we get even more of the data that rolls in from this report. And we can add a little bit more context to this as well. Yeah, consumer confidence. Interesting. But I look at these quarters from Coca-Cola, Assurance Williams, these companies are out there raising prices. And the consumers by and large, they've been able to withstand these prices. Yeah. But this is still a miss on what was actually estimated here. We were looking for 105.9. So coming in at 102.5, the markets right now still holding on to some of the move higher. And of course, this is kind of permeated from yesterday's trading activity. And even last week with this little bippity bought bounce, if you want to call it that, where we have seen, of course, in this larger bear market, at least these bounces in the near term. And a larger question of where consumers sit within that. And where the strength of the consumer is, where demand is actually coming in from. And I think that's a lot of really what's spelling out how confident the consumer really is at this point in time. You see demand is far different regardless of with the industries that we're looking at. Demand for travel, far different than demand for even Coca-Cola, as we're talking about. Even though you may see, it actually show up in the results and outpace some of the expectations, the expectations for the companies on the equity front have actually been lowered. So it's a question of, all right, where will the consumer continue to see some of that strength even as we're continuing to discuss the risk of recession too? All right. Let's stay on all things economy and the consumer. Strikingly different tone from shipping giant UPS this morning on its earnings report, compared to longtime rival FedEx. UPS showing good growth in the US and reaffirming its full year guidance ranges. This comes on the heels of FedEx badly whipping on earnings and on corking a fresh restructuring plan just a few weeks ago, UPS CFO Brian Newman just got off his earnings call and joins us now. Good to see you here. Brian is always just for the late.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,2,2022-10-25 14:04:05
4022," Horking a fresh, restructuring plan just a few weeks ago, UPS CFO Brian Newman just got off his earnings call and joins us now. Good to see you here. Brian is always just for the lay investor out there. These stories between a UPS and a FedEx are now strikingly different, like I just mentioned. Why do you think you and your team are out executing a FedEx? Hey, Brian, good morning. It's great to see you. Listen, we have a mantra around here, which is control, which you can control. And we've been really focused on doing that over the last couple of quarters. The macros have been challenging domestically and particularly internationally. But we've been focused on with softer volumes across the world, really. How do we ensure we drive the right pricing mix and dynamics and also control the cost by doing that? You protect your margins and deliver to the shareholders. And Brian, I just want to stand that before we jump onto the broader quarter. So you're not out there closing sorting facilities, laying people off, right? I just want to make sure I have it right. So we are tightening the belt. Certainly at the corporate, we spend a lot of money in GNA. We've been tightening the belt there. But we've been doing that for a couple of years trying to right size the business. Carol introduced a better, not bigger strategy to the company. And what that really is, optimize the volume that comes into the system. So it's more profitable and then take the cost down. So we have been certainly right sizing the business over the last couple of years. But no, we're not closing sorting facilities right now. We have the ability to take our variable to set every variable cost down should the case arise. And so where are you seeing continued strength within the business? And the customers that you're servicing right now? That's a great question, Brad. The healthcare segment is a particularly strong one. We're doing very, very well there. The, as you think about the small and medium business, that's been a core focus over the last couple of years. We've been addressing the capabilities that those customers want. And by doing that, you create a wonderful environment for a very profitable customer. So we've been focused on the SMB, small and medium business, the healthcare segment. And then overall, trying to look at that international business because there's lots of growth opportunity there for us. We've been talking a lot about FX headwinds. That companies are seeing right now. When you think about that international business, of course, UPS is going to be rolling out some pricing increases. This also impacts the international segment in December, I believe. And that really going to be reflected as you finally get into 2023 as well. What is your anticipation around where the consumers and the strength that you were just laying out? Where they'll continue to take that price increase? So we announced a price increase for next year at 6.9%. That's supposed to be representative of a combination of inflation as well as the service we provide. So that will help drive the base rate in terms of the pricing equation. As we think about the currency impact that you mentioned, Brett, the currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business. But we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. Brian, I recently spoke to another Brian, Brian Cornell over a target for our all market summit conference last week. You see the holiday season is, is he's expecting to be pretty good? What's your read on things? So Brian and I used to work together at PepsiCoast. So I know him and target is a very important customer for UPS. I actually think it's going to be a decent peak season. We're ramping up right now. We're hiring. We hire over 100,000 people for the peak season to get ready. And with targets, customers like target, we're out there committing to them that we're going to be there with the excellent service that UPS provide. So I think that Brian, the peak season, our peak season volume goes up 50, 60% from a normal run rate. So it is a meaningful increase. But as we think about peak this year, you don't have the low inventory levels that we saw last year, which drove an earlier peak. People were rushing out to buy because they were afraid the inventory wouldn't be there for the holiday season. This year, inventories are much higher at the retail stores. So I think it'll be a bit of a later peak, Brian. All right, competing against Santa Claus like efficiency there in the logistics business. When you think about some of the future investments as well, they're Brian, and going out into next year and even beyond, what are the investments that you would like to see the company get right the first time in order to build a logistical network in a system that can really see its margins excel over the future? So that's a great question, Brad. The digital investments we're making, it's really shifting dynamic of UPS, old school package delivery. To now, it's more of an orchestrator of volume from end to end. We're putting investments into things like RFID technology so that every package in our system will have a code on it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,3,2022-10-25 14:08:09
4023," orchestrator of volume from end to end. We're putting investments into things like RFID technology so that every package in our system will have a code on it that we know where it is. And if there's nothing more frustrating for consumers or customers when they lose a package or they have an issue, they want to know where that package is by deploying this kind of technology. We're going to be able to tell people where are your packages and how can we recover and make sure we get them there on time for when the customers want them. And we do that at an incredible mid-90s percent in terms of on-time delivery. Brian, I made this comment earlier in the show before you came on. And I said, UPS is benefiting from, of course, having you as CFO, but also Carol too. Long time CFO, a home depot before she came to you. Am I off base there? Are you guys just looking at the quarter or your business differently than other big public companies? Brian, it's wonderful to have a boss. There used to be a CFO because we have great conversations. But Carol's done an amazing job shifting the culture. So as we think about the future of UPS, the yesterday's UPS is not going to get us tomorrow to where we want to be. We're 115-year-old company. Very proud of our past. But Carol is shifting the company to a place called Better and Boulder. The Boulder is growth and margin improvement. And so where is that going to come from? Areas of basically leaning into the most attractive parts of the market. I mentioned SMB. Margin's are great. It's a very attractive area. Healthcare. That's a high growth, high margin area. International. We're actually number two and three. And a number of markets overseas. So we're focused on stealing revenue share, value share as we call it, and going out there. So we're putting our investments in those areas that will be a credo from an investment perspective. UPS, CFO, Brian Newman. Thanks so much for joining us here this morning and breaking down the most recent quarter. Appreciate it. Thanks, Brian. Brian Brad, thank you. You got it. And everyone, switching gears here, let's take a look at some of the market activity that we've been tracking here. Out of the gate this morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at least about 38 minutes into trading, holding on to gains. And this after what was weaker than expected, consumer confidence reading from the conference board here this morning. But as of right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still up by about 110 points. Also, you've got the NASDAQ composite. That's higher by about 1.4%. And the S&P 500, you're seeing that hold on to gains to the tune of about 8% to 10% here. Also checking in on some of the other activity that we're seeing here on the day. We saw some electric vehicle, well, what category is it? It's electric vehicle earnings that have come out. But GM, really talking about their market share within this most recent quarter, shares are holding on to gains of about 2.4% that electric vehicle market share reaching about 8%. They said in this most recent report, we're also going to get results out from Ford. And that's going to be coming later on this week as well. And so as of right now, holding on to gains of about 1.4% there for Ford 2-Saus. All right, thanks, Brad. Before we head to break, let's flex some cautious comments on Meta into its earnings report on Wednesday from Jeffey Zanel's Brent Phil says that while Meta's stock appears cheap, we believe investors need four key levers to drive the stock higher. One, revenue growth above 2% and guidance of a possible acceleration in the fourth quarter. Two, flat or even declining year of a year expense growth, three, increased focus on the core business away from the metaverse. And four, the re-acceleration of share it repurchases, indeed, a tall order for Meta on its earnings report. Check the label on that dry shampoo.

4025," but still incredibly high prices, as you just noted, by the increase in final prices for US households, as well as affordability tied to interest rate hikes. So in both cases, we think the consumers will slow down dramatically, leading into a very shallow recession for early next year. Interesting. So with that in mind, where do you believe the mindset of the consumer would be by that point? Well, we're looking at the numbers from a consumer confidence a bit weaker than what we in market had expected. The idea is there that even that we expected a little bit not as extreme, largely because we saw a bit of a pick up in stock market, as well as pooling of gasoline prices. Well, that's not enough for consumers. They're still disappointed. And because it's not just about gasoline, it's about affordability and pretty much all aspects of society, particularly for shelter, not just how purchasing a home, but also renting a home. And that means less money to spend elsewhere. People are squeezed and we do think they'll finally buckle. Bethan, I've really been surprised by how many or how much price increases. A lot of these big companies have been reporting in recent weeks as they've come out with earnings. I continue to double-gen, double-gen increases for products and services, really for the second quarter in a row. When does it stop? When are we beyond these double-digit increases? Well, we're expecting to see eventually one of the reasons the good news about a recession and also the big difference lower prices. And the big question of is, what if consumers do slow down as we expect, that means there's going to be more inventory on businesses' books. So if we do see a sleep slowdown for consumers, then we end up seeing as a lot of inventory used to be unloaded. And unfortunately, that inventory is unloaded at lower prices. So indeed, the fact gets its wish in the end. But of course, there's a cost to both businesses and consumers as well. We've got a lot of companies that have started reporting earnings fast and furious in this most recent quarter. But the forward guidance here is going to be the big question. What are your expectations for where companies will continue to either reiterate their guidance or for some of them? We've already seen at least in the case of SNAP. No, a specific name. But where they might start to say, you know what, we have to either pull back our guidance or just pull it in entirety. And what net impact would that have? Well, speaking from an economic position, again, I don't cover particular industries or companies. But I can say that given this environment, this is a classic overheating situation for the United States, where the Fed has to come in and be incredibly aggressive. Understandably, we have core inflation still at a 40-year high on a year over your basis. So they have to move. And with that said, what I suspect we could see for those businesses that switched from just in time in inventory accumulation to just in case inventory accumulation, that means that they're going to be squeezed. And so I suspect the floor of guidance would be basically what happens to profits when we have to unload all those impenetories. That's where I suspect we can see some activity, particularly for retail, the retail sector who have been holding on to things. But I suppose other areas would be squeezed as well. Within your outlook, Beth Ann, for a mild recession, is the economy shedding jobs? Are we talking about non-farm payroll reports where maybe there's 50,000 jobs should? In our business cycle barometer, the one indicator that is still showing positive, everything else is neutral or negative and extremely negative. But the one area that we're seeing still positive territories in that jobs market that you pointed to, we're looking at job openings coming down, slowing down, but still rather high. So the question is, are businesses canceling that job opening and still want to hold on to those workers? I suspect in certain areas that we're going to see the crunch retail, I mentioned housing. Also, I suspect we're going to see some kind of a cutting of jobs, but overall we suspect a mild impact on jobs. And we do expect to see the unemployment rate rise, but we're looking at something that's going to be by 2024 about 5.5% in normal times. That's what we used to get to. So indeed, we'll see a pickup, but nothing dramatically. Dramatically so. Beth Ann Bovino, S&P Global Ratings, US Chief of Com's always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon.

Starting season rolls off at reports from Big Tech Giants, Microsoft and Alphabet expected after the closing bell today. Y'all find TechEd or Dan Halley joins us now to preview what to expect. And Dan, it could be another interesting quarter for both these companies. We have that strong dollar, you have growth slowing down. How do you see things? Yeah, we also have, you know, starting with Microsoft, obviously their cloud business, doing well. But then there's the drop in consumer spending on the personal computer front. So that could really sting Microsoft. Let's take a look at the numbers here. We have revenue estimates coming in at $49.6 billion. That's according to the street's consensus estimate. And then EPS, adjusted EPS, we have that coming in at $2.29. We have the productivity and business processes revenue. That's $16.12 billion. And then we have the intelligent cloud that's going to be at $20.31 billion. These are again, all those estimates. And then the more personal computing at $13.09 billion, that's a slight, slight increase. So, you know, we're starting to see the effects on Microsoft's bottom line of this kind of pullback in consumer spending on those types of devices. Not just because, you know, there's not enough on the market as there may have been during the pandemic, but because so many people purchased during the pandemic, but there's no reason for them to go back out and buy computers. Again, those usually last, you know, anywhere from three to five to seven years for some consumer. So there's really no reason for them to jump back out into the market. And then, you know, on the Google front, we're looking at revenue X-TAC, which is a traffic acquisition cost. That's at $58.18 billion or $58.2 billion. And then we have EPS, adjusted EPS, estimated at $1.36. An advertising revenue is going to be the big issue here, whether or not they're stung.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,7,2022-10-25 14:25:34
4027," billion or 58.2 billion and then we have EPS adjusted EPS estimated at dollar 36. An advertising revenue was going to be the big issue here whether or not they're stung similar to how we saw SNAP stung when it reported last week taking that huge one in their stock price after reporting those disappointing earnings. We're looking at potential revenue of 57 billion from advertising and then cloud services at 6.61 billion. They're still being kind of work through to try and improve those make it one of the larger offerings on the market still well behind Amazon and Microsoft which are number one and number two and then we also have the other bets at 204 million. We also had reports that Google was coming back on some of its projects that may be visible in some of the the earnings we'll have to see there what the cap X looks like. So yeah obviously two important reports from two important companies especially when it comes to both the cloud and the digital advertising markets. We also got meta up there on the screen too they're expected to report you mentioned that you're going to be tracking across all of these companies where it does apply FX, cloud and ads but what about the metaverse and the spending perhaps if I was to sum it up to that for all of these tech companies and how that should be in focus too. Yeah I think for you know meta obviously the question is how much did it earn as far as ad revenue how much has been hurt as far as ad revenue and then how much is it continuing to spend on the metaverse project you know we had Mark Zuckerberg talking it meta connect basically laying out what he sees is the the future of the metaverse how the company is going to kind of build that out and the different opportunities they're available focusing heavily on you know work environment obviously Microsoft CEO Sanctinadel had made an appearance for that and then on the gaming environment but you know there's been calls obviously for there to be a reduced reduction in spending on the metaverse and there's been reports you know where the the worlds that they're building just aren't exciting for customers and that the headsets they offer aren't something that people usually use as you know months after they purchase the one like you know a gaming console or or PC so it'll be interesting to see what kind of the the situation is like on meta as far as what the ad revenue is and then what that means as far as the metaverse goes and the spending there because they have been just plowing money into it and you know they they're putting this as a long-term goal but you know for now it doesn't look like anybody's very much interested in it outside of you know a few use cases that may benefit the work environment but you know for the average consumer I don't think it's something that's really getting them going yeah who finances Dan Howley the tech DH if you will hear Dan appreciate the time breaking down and teeing up some of these earnings reports set to come out appreciate it and switching gears here everyone cutting ties Adidas has become the latest company to end its partnership with Yeh formerly known as Kanye West following his anti-semitic remarks the athletic brand says it will stop production of Yeezy branded products immediately along with all payments to Yeh and his companies Bernstein senior analyst Anisha Sherman joins us now to discuss alongside Yeh who finances Alexandra Canal Anisha great to have you here with us today help us really put this kind of into perspective on the business front $250 million net income short-term negative impact Adidas is saying that this is going to mean at a time when the brand was already seeing some of that waning popularity within their core consumer groups Yes this is coming at a tough time for the company they just have their second of two early earnings releases and guidelines for the year they're now expecting Q4 to come in negative profitability anyway you know ex this Yeezy impact and will this 250 million will further reduce the bottom line for Q4 the Q3 results have already been pre-released the Yeezy day which was in August counted towards Q3 performance and was quite successful however the launches that were slated for Q4 which were meant to come out in the kind of you know October November timeframe have now been completely pulled and thus the impacts of the sales and the bottom line and what's more important is Adidas is going to stop using the Yeezy label altogether although the company does own the rights to the product they're going to rebrand it as Adidas product and stop using the Yeezy brand label completely",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,8,2022-10-25 14:29:42
4028," the easy label altogether. Although the company does own the rights to the product, they're gonna rebrand it as Adidas product and stop using the easy brand label completely, which should take a haircut off the 2023 and beyond sales as well. Because that was quite a successful brand branchized for the company. And in Asia, there's no denying how successful the easy brand has been for Adidas, largely because it catered to Gen Z. It had that social currency with Yeh, who at the time of the partnership in 2013, he was at the top of his game. So what other types of partnerships or alternative revenue streams should Adidas consider exploring in order to cater to that Gen Z consumer base? Yeah, that's a good question. So Yeh, he has been one of their more successful franchises. But in recent years, they have tried to diversify that by adding a few additional franchises. We've seen them come out this year with launches, with Gucci and with Prada. The Gucci collection in particular was very successful and they view it as a multi-year partnership. They're continuing their partnership with Stella McCartney, which is also a multi-year long-term partnership. It's also premium product, higher margin product, and they're continuing their work with Beyonce with the Adi Part collection, which also released a new line this year and will continue to be a multi-year partnership. So they do have several other partnerships. This isn't their only one, but that being said, Yeh, Z has been, as you said, one of the more successful ones. So it will require a haircut to sales estimates as well as margins for the coming year or so. Andisha, why do you think it took so long for a deedist to make this decision? Because I do think it says a lot about the corporate governance of a company like that. Yeah, I mean, this debate has been going on since August. So it started when, actually Kanye West came out against Adidas, alleging that they had stolen his intellectual property. Adidas insisted that they own all the IP of the easy franchise that's been released today. And that's for kind of normal terms of when, you know, these kinds of partnerships. But this debate has continued for the last two months. They were trying to make amends and trying to make things work. They had a few years left on the contract, but it's been under review for the last couple of weeks. They probably could have come to an agreement sooner. I don't know the details behind their legal disagreements, but essentially, I mean, it's a big part of their revenue and profit print that this franchise is one of them more successful. So I think they were trying to figure out a way to break things off whether they would continue using the easy name, whether they had the right to continue, how that would impact both this years and ongoing sales and how they would kind of position the brand going forward, which is why it took a few days longer. And there's been increasing pressure on the company to drop him, as we've seen other companies drop him over the last couple of weeks, thanks to his all of his statements in the past few weeks. Relative to what's going on with Adidas at the moment and his Brad was saying, there's a lot of other issues at this company besides the just EA. How do you view the competitive landscape? Yeah, it's a tough year for sportswear in general because China has continued to be a very slow market, both partly due to macro concerns as people have been held back by COVID restrictions, but also due to a continued prominence of local brands of Chinese-owned brands that have taken share from the big Western brands. So that's been a market that's continued to be tough, particularly for Adidas, as they underinvested in the region in the past and are now trying to make up for lost ground. At the same time, North America, as I'm sure you know, is going into a pretty heavy inventory quarter as your guest speaker was talking about a few minutes ago, and that's going to impact them as well. So we have the bearish China outlook, the kind of short-term bearish North American outlook, and then Amia. Amia is also under pressure. The consumer continues to pull back on discretionary spend. So it's been a tough year overall for the competitive landscape in general. It's been a tougher year for Adidas because they've had specific challenges in China to get their brand back on track. And so even preceding this easy announcement, they were expecting net income to drop below 500 million for the year, and that number is now even lower. Do you believe that there's a trickle through here to the resale market as well, considering what led to the termination of this deal? Do people now go on a stadium goods who's owned by Farfetch, a publicly traded company, and say, I don't want to buy easy shoes? Do they go on a stock X and say, you know, I'm not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,9,2022-10-25 14:34:06
4029," will now go on a stadium goods whose owned by Farfetch, a publicly traded company, and say, I don't want to buy easy shoes. Do they go on a stock ex and say, I'm not any longer interested in buying this product? Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think if the product were continuing to be sold by Adidas, I would expect a general boycott of it. Now that the product is not going to be sold by Adidas, I think there might be a reversal of effect where this becomes the easy product becomes somewhat of a collector's item, maybe not right now or nobody wants to touch it. But in over the next couple of years, it becomes a limited edition collector's item that's sold in resale. But I think the decision to stop branding the easy brand was a good decision for Adidas because at the moment, that brand is associated very strongly with the creator, with the artist, and they want to cut the disassociate themselves completely. So I think what happens in the resale market is because of this restricted supply, it could continue to trade, but in the primary market, that was probably the right decision for that to do. And you said that the Yeezy line has been popular, almost it hit the market. And because of that popularity, I think an argument could be made, it has taken market share from a company like Nike. But now if that brand is no longer going to be, at Adidas is a Nike winner here. Yeah, I think they lose that portion of the market share, which was the Yeezy premium product. They are going to relaunch, they're going to continue to launch the designs. I mean, it's unclear where they're going to launch it as a sub brand or as just a kind of under the, Adidas and Brella overall, they obviously aren't going to use the Yeezy name anymore, but the sneaker heads and the loyal customers will know it's the same product as just being launched under the Adidas and brand and Brella. So I think they will retain some of those sales, they're not going to lose that entire kind of, you know, 1.5 to 2 billion worth of sales, but it will take a haircut because it's not being branded under that Yeezy brand anymore. It will probably seed some share to some of the other sneaker head brands, including Nike. The real sneaker heads will always know Anisha Sherman. Thanks so much for joining us here on the morning Bernstein Senior Analyst Anisha Sherman and Yahoo Finance's own, Allie Canal. Appreciate it. You guys coming up, turbulence guys, and expensive times for JetBlue shares of the company moving lower by about 6.5% after the company posted the profit in the last quarter. CEO, the CEO, excuse me, warning that every penny matters as cost, the support fuel, continue to rise. We've got the full breakdown from the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,10,2022-10-25 14:38:42
4030," a Welcome back everyone. Let's turn now to some market movers this morning. Let's start with JetBlueEarnings, ticker symbol JBLU. Shares moving lower by a little more than 6%. This is after the airline company reported earnings for the third quarter, missing estimates on the bottom line while beating out revenue expectations here. A few things to really consider here, the fact that many of the airline operators are still getting back to full capacity compared to 2019 for JetBlue. You've also got this near term deal and the finalization of that deal that is still very much just hanging in the balance waiting to be fully done and investors have had time to realize what that might mean to the balance sheets of JetBlue once that finally goes through. In the near term though, they are still being one of the beneficiaries of this north eastern alliance along with American Airlines too, which really helped them during the summer travel season. But in the near term, I believe that those fuel prices still being up, I think it was up 87% comparable to last year. That's something that American Airlines had also cited in their most recent earnings. And just like we were talking about, excuse me earlier Brad, between the now emerging different investing stories between a UPS and FedEx, I would argue, I put forth that same thesis on JetBlue. You talked to Delta CEO Ed Bastion, very good quarter, American Airlines, very good quarter. What was United reported to? Already? Strong demand. Strong demand, very good quarter. A little bit of different tone from JetBlue and it makes you wonder, are they going to get distracted or have they been distracted by trying to first solidify the spirit deal? And now, oh yeah, they're going to have to integrate it at some point if it gets approval. Yeah, and that integration, when you're thinking about updating an entire airline, everything from painting planes to try and get rid of that ugly yellow color all the way to making sure that you've just got a different aircraft that maybe doesn't feel like a canister in the sky. All of those things get taken into consideration. So updates of the fleets, also the integration of the teams and the operation. And it's also going to be a consideration around which actual flight gates that you're positioned at so that you can kind of condense what that operational space looks like at the hubs that you're working in and out of as well. They're all in on the anti yellow. They're in on the yellow. 100%. You're in. All right. Chairs of Tesla, they're up after surprisingly, bearers take from Morgan Stanley, the bank cutting, it's price target to $3 and $3 down from $350, sending a highly volatile economic environment and anticipating unexpected headwinds. And of course, this call comes from our friend of the show, Adam Jonas, over at Morgan Stanley, always a market mover on Tesla. He's still staying bullish, of course, on Tesla. He's been a long time bull in this company. He's really noting for what he, making, he's saying, quote, making room for unexpected, unexpected headwinds in the current economic environment, our argue Brad, some of those unexpected headwinds are coming out of China. When he talked about China was yesterday, Tesla cutting prices in that China market, that is a complete new term from what Tesla had been experiencing last year and even the first part of this year. Right. And for Tesla, they have to acknowledge what's happening in the region too. That sounded like when they were on the call that they didn't want to really discuss what is really taking place within that region in China. You have so much competition that is being brought online that much quicker, that is improving their capacity for production, improving their relations with customers in the region too, who have the propensity to buy some of the electric vehicles, either on the mass market side or on the more expensive side. And the propensity right now is leaning towards some of the homegrown brands in the region too. And it doesn't want to acknowledge that of course, they want to continue to focus on their products, but I think it still is a realization that has to be factored in to what their forecasts are actually looking like in the region too. Right. And I mentioned that X-PUN is really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,11,2022-10-25 14:42:47
4031," Still is a realization that has to be factored in to what their forecasts are actually looking like in the region too. Right. And on this too, you know, yesterday I mentioned that X-Pung is really going toe-to-toe with Tessel and China. And I got raked over the calls on Twitter for it. I do think folks, even the Tesla bulls pull up some of the specs on these X-Pung vehicles. They are very impressive. That technology package in that car is very, very impressive indeed. All right. For Tessel, let's stand all things industrial. UPS had a good quarter as CFO Brian Newman explained to us just moments ago that is just not the vibe over at rival FedEx. We'll talk to it one-allest downgraded FedEx recently. That's next. I saw a quarter from UPS this morning, but the company did reiterate full year guidance unlike its rival FedEx. You folks, to UPS CFO Brian Newman said the company has been working on new plans for the past couple of years. So, let's take a listen. We spend a lot of money in GNA. We've been tightening the belt there, but we've been doing that for a couple of years trying to right size the business. Carol introduced a better, not bigger strategy to the company and what that really is, optimize the volume that comes into the system. So, it's more profitable and then take the cost down. So, we have been certainly right sizing the business over the last couple of years, but no, we're not closing sorting facilities right now. We have the ability to take our variable and set every variable cost down should the case arise. And a little bit of set of different circumstances over FedEx, which led to Wells Fargo analyst, Alison Pliniaccusic to slash or rating on the stock. Alison joins us now. Alison, really a different tone between what UPS reported today and what has been happening over FedEx. Why do you think that's the case? Well, first good morning and it was clear, you know, I would say it's execution, right. And as Brian mentioned in the previous comments, they've been on this path, right. And right sizing the network, they're driving increased agility.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,12,2022-10-25 14:47:18
4032," It was clear, you know, I would say it's execution, right? And as Brian mentioned in the previous comments, they've been on this path, right? They've been right sizing the network. They're driving increased agility in the network. BetX is maybe a couple of steps behind at this point. They laid out there, certainly their cross plan restructuring plan going forward to adjust to the current volume environment. Just the execution, I would say, you certainly saw that divergence is quarter. There's a differing strategy in terms of where these businesses are investing and perhaps one of those operational expenses that could change in the future for FedEx might be in even the employee classification. Do you think that there's going to be some successful push for unionization among the employee base at FedEx? Well, if you're looking to the ground, right? It's an outsourced objective, you know, potentially I wouldn't comment on the union piece about, you know, obviously EPS is unionized drivers at this point. BetX is certainly working with their providers on the ground piece domestically to adjust to the current environment. When might the FedEx investment thesis become just a little more stable? I think what they reported a couple weeks ago really shocked a lot of investors. When does that start to turn in the other way? And that was part of reason for our downgrade. You know, if you look to the pre-announcement relative to what our numbers were, you know, sense of the mis was really driven by revenue. A $1.50 that mis was operations. That's the piece that they're trying to attack today. And I would say just given the recent execution, our confidence in their ability to execute with the increasing headwinds is a little bit more relaxed at this point. So we're looking for, I would say, success at the execution initiatives, whether it's right sizing the aircraft network, bringing down facilities, you know, essentially just relining their network, not only for the current environment, but obviously for the, you know, the potential pivot chart. Well, as far as security is analysts, Alison Poliniac, Chris, thanks so much for joining us and breaking down your FedEx expectations going forward from here. We appreciate the time. You guys coming up, gotta catch all the McRibs from Pokemon Games. So McRib, Fairwell, tour who we're ending the show in high class fashion. That's always really here. Getting how it takes on the other side. Just love Peter. It's like a rons of toilet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,13,2022-10-25 14:51:38
4033," [""Deck No Welcome back everyone. It is time for Cretan Time. We've got three stories. One minute each. We start with this today, Warner Brothers says the cost of its scrapped shows and sitcoms it could total $2.5 billion. This is as it restructures itself financially. Now the thing to remember for so many of the production houses as they have been shifting into streaming, there's a ton more data that they're being able to leverage to really determine whether or not a show even before it goes to production is going to be successful. Which makes it even more alarming perhaps that there's a $2.5 billion hit that you could see when you are having that massive shift towards a streaming platform launching that streaming service and then actually forecasting what will perform well in that environment too. Yeah, look, there's just a continues to be a rapid changes in the environment, how content is consumed, of course led by the streaming movement and I just think a lot of these companies, legacy media companies are realizing there's still a lot of bloat inside of them. You have one person that reports to another person and they all report to one other person. There's just too many people in there given this changing dynamic. So again, I think you'll probably see more layoffs or more changes like this. And is there a change in the binging trends as well as the business of binge? Is that kind of the thing in the past now? No, we're all, we're still watching. We're all binging. We're still binging. Yeah, I'm definitely binging. All right, Mattel, catching the best Pokemon of their all, Pokemon of them all, the Toymaker securing a franchise deal to make Pokemon toys under license. This is, I would say, yet another big win for Mattel and CEO and on cries. They are going to report earnings to Nights. This has just been, you know, in addition to the revival of the Barbie brand, this is just another feather in the hat of a non in that team over there. This is just, I mean, it's a home run deal. Essentially, just really stealing it off from the nose of Hasbro. This is massive. You've got an international brand, one that has had so much success across gaming and some of the digital spaces as well has had a successful entertainment side of the business that directly dovetails into how many people want to buy the toys over time. And I was one of those kids growing up. I had these toys. That was your generation. That and Pokemon toys. And Power Rangers. Yes. They had one of the most virally successful AR apps in game experiences. You remember back in 2015, 2016? People would just stop in the middle of the street. People lawns trying to catch a virtual Pokemon. There you go. My generation, it was Bugs Bunny, you know, mid-80s, late 80s, Bugs Bunny on Saturday morning. It was Space Yard. Well, no AR. Oh man, the dark days of no AR. A parking pig. Yes. That's all folks. And Leslie here in McDonald's is bringing back the beloved Mick Rib pork sandwich for what it calls a farewell tour here. Oh gosh. Okay. You call this the Mick Heart or the Mick Shoulder because if you Google search what's in these? What's in that? It's not actual rib. I think McDonald's has said this in the past. That is not rib. It is a mashup of all these different parts of an animal slathered. And I will give this. You know, that barbecue sauce on the Mick Rib is very, very good. I'm hoping. I'm hoping, Brad. Yeah. They are going to pull this off the menu and start selling a real rib product like Arbises out there right now selling. Love me some Arbises rib. But you've been telling me that to this point the Mick Rib is actually a Mick Scrapple. Yeah. Essentially what it's telling me. If you go online you can see it's usually a stripe, heart and shoulder, all mixed together. I'm just reporting what's out there. Look, I mean, it is kind of tasty sometimes when you... It's on our Mick Heart flunch. Give me a Mick Heart. I mean, well, thank goodness for the fail world tour of the Mick Rib. We hope it's well received. Perhaps among those who celebrate Mick Ribs out there in the world. Any with a Mick Calorie? 520 Calories here for the Mick Rib. Definitely not, dude.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,14,2022-10-25 14:55:50

4035," Music Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Lake Ego from Gina. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Stocks getting a tailwind as GM, UPS and Coca-Cola all beat the street. The NASDAQ pushing higher ahead of big results from Alphabet and Microsoft. So to the moon, we're going to ask D-Full about the $4,300 call on $4,300 call. I should say on the S&P. The corporate dropout, Adidas terminates this relationship with Kanye West and the Yeezy brand, saying it doesn't condone any form of hate speech. It sees a short-term negative impact on finances, but is there a bigger fallout to come? We've got a panel standing by to discuss. And return of the SPAC former House Speaker Paul Ryan backs his company all the way to the New York Stock Exchange. Listening, a listing will ask Kim about market choppiness and how he feels two weeks ahead of his all-important midterms. First though, let's check in on the market action right now. We are seeing green across the board. As we look at all three major indices right now, 90 minutes into the trading day. The Dow up about 175 points right now. The S&P 500 up 36 and the NASDAQ up 157. As always, or I should say, especially this week, the NASDAQ, the big one to watch with Microsoft and Alphabet on tap today after the bell. But we are kicking off this hour with General Motors. Out with better than expected earning today. And we are seeing that reflected in the shares up more than 3% as the auto manufacturer reaffirms its full-year outlook despite a challenging environment. GM reporting a record third quarter revenue of $41.9 billion, driving $3.3 billion of net income attributable to stockholders for a closer look at GM and the auto space. Let's turn to our very on-pros a supermanian. It does feel like they've kind of turned the corner in terms of those big headwinds they've been facing, whether it is the supply shortage inventory. Not quite up to where they want it to be, but it is headed in the right direction. Yeah, for sure. They had a record quarter revenue just barely below analyst expectations. Big profit here, 4.3 billion in adjusted net income. That's almost 50% higher than a year ago. Like you said, they were able to hit these sort of numbers. Demand is strong. Supply constraints easing. You saw that they reaffirms their EBIT clients for the year, which a lot of people thought they would maybe take that down because of the fact that maybe things are slowing down. Maybe there are some issues with supply and pricing. Mary Barra in her letter said that they reaffirmed the guys despite a challenging environment because demand continues to be strong for GM products and we're actively managing headwinds that we face. Also talking about how they captured 8% of the EV market share with the Bolt and Bolt EV doing really well. They're an increase in production of that car. And they're on track for their EV game plan. They're going to release the Equinox, the blazer, the Silverado next year. And they again maintain that they acquire materials enough materials for 1 million EV run rate in 2025. So a lot of good things here in this quarter for GM. Ford obviously the next one on tap to report their results. Is there anything we can take away from what GM reported today in terms of where things are headed in the car space particularly on EVs? Well it sounds like demand isn't an issue at least for US automakers and I think for the price of the same thing potentially tomorrow. Big question is are they going to also reaffirm their guides. We're not as lucky as sure. They're sort of hinting at they're having issues with kind of headwinds like.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,16,2022-10-25 15:04:46
4036," to the same thing potentially tomorrow. Big question is, are they going to also reaffirm their guins? We're not as lucky as you're sure. They're sort of hinting at they're having issues with kind of headwinds like the pricing pressures they're facing. So could that take down their guinets or for profit guins? We'll see. But it sounds like demand is not a concern. Despite the fact that we have so many kind of the negative drum beat of is the global macro economy, economy kind of withering, is pricing coming down. I think what we're seeing is that it's not affecting demand for cars at least. Yeah, we've heard sort of the question, I guess the verdict still out, whether in fact we're at that tipping point with EVs gas prices creeping back up again. So we'll continue to watch the demand there. Thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look now at more big name earnings starting with Coca-Cola, the beverage giant topping estimates in its latest quarter as well as raising its revenue outlook for 2022. Though unable to avoid the currency headwinds weighing on others shares just slightly there. Joining me now is Yahoo Finance, his brand, Sasi, itching to get into all those numbers. Where do we start? I think I start on pricing. It's been the theme of the morning. It's not just with a Coca-Cola. It's a UPSU name. But anyway, with Coca-Cola pricing up 12% in that third quarter, also Coke Zero. Coke Zero, up 11% in terms of sales. It's been, I think it was a blowout quarter for Coca-Cola. A little bit of a squishy guidance outlook from the company, but still very much mirrored what we heard from Pepsi Co. last week. Strong pricing, strong demand. Consumers not really blocking at these price increases. And I think the next big thing for Coca-Cola is this really next wave of innovation. More new flavors for Coke Zero. More new flavors for Costa coffee. That's a brand they bought. I believe two and a half years ago, I think the company is really winning high marks on the street after a quarter like this. UPSU, another name that you're watching really closely. There are FX headwinds yet again being mentioned like so many earnings calls. Really make me work today. But yes, UPSU, good quarter for UPS, strikingly different compared to what we heard from FedEx, which later real egg in terms of this earnings two and a half weeks ago. But look what CFO Brian Newman told us about FX challenges on its business in the third quarter. The currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business. But we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. And right up there we're pricing Kiko. It is the currency headwind, of course impacting UPS, but also heard Coca-Cola by 8% in terms of their sales in the most recent quarter. We talked to Beth Ann Bovino in the prior hour and the 10 o'clock hour. And these currency headwinds are likely to be around for some time. They're not going away in the fourth quarter. They might stick around into the first half of next year and likely continue to weigh on sales. Yeah, and something that we're tracking every day in terms of dollar strength. All right, we got you on set. We're going to keep working you, Brian. I know we're doing all right. G-E, let's do it. Let's go. G and 3M. All right, well G-E later, another dud. I'm surprised the stock is not completely falling off a cliff here. One of the hottest tickers on the out of finance platform here this morning. That is G-E and 3M. I'll start with G-E. They actually warned on their full year. And I think you could really tie to two things. First, the renewable energy segment was again a dreadful quarter. Orders down 43% operate at a loss on an adjusted operating profit base. Not a good quarter for them. And I do think this is a management team severely distracted by trying to split up its company into three businesses. GE Healthcare will be the first one out of the shoot as a public company in early January. And then 3M, like GE, lowering its full year outlook. And again, another one, just not some, I'm really surprised not see a stronger negative market reaction when you see a 3M warn, warn about currency, concerned about higher inflation in the supply chain. But again, two industrial giants right now, hot tickers on our platform, both warning for the full year. Not a great, I would say, read on the global economy. Yeah, you're right, not as big of a reaction with 3M down about 6. You want to do it anymore? Any more? You got it? I can keep going. You have to write like five stories, right? I'll count you, okay. Very fair. Go to Yahoo Finance.com. How about that? We'll pitch all your stories. All right, friends, as a thanks so much for that. And let's move on to our trending ticker. Terpilins for Jeff Blue shares in the airline carrier under heavy pressure after the company missed analyst estimates on its latest results. The company earned 21 cents a share on revenue of $2.5 billion. Revenue per available seat mile, which is a key metric we track. Increased by more than 23%, a strong travel demand and higher ticket prices helps offset those higher costs. Still though, Jeff Blue expects some of that demand to soften in the current quarter, but the president's a chief operating officer saying he expects capacity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,17,2022-10-25 15:08:58

Still though, JetBlue expects some of that demand to soften in the current quarter, but the president's chief operating officer saying he expects capacity to be up just one to 4% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Well, coming up, Yeezy doesn't. Adidas parts ways with the artist formerly known as Kanye West after a string of controversies. Because of the battle over his namesake brand, that had been poor. We've got a lot to discuss on this headline here. That's coming up on the other side. Well, stocks currently looking positive across all three major indices, right now with a Dow up, more than 200 points. There's a relief rally on their rise, and our next guest thinks so, and says the S&P could make its way back to 4,300 by April. That is barring outside factors. Joining us now is Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at C. Fullbury. We could all use some positive news after the last month that we've had. Certainly, we have seen gains pick up over the last few weeks on this expectation, potentially, of a Fed pivot. What are you watching right now in terms of levels that really you think could push things in the right direction? Well, you know a lot of the bad news was known. And we had a violent sell-off in the first 10 months of this year. If you look at the nominal peak of the S&P 500 index, it was 4,800 on January 3rd, but the real inflation adjusted purchasing power peak was 5,100 on December 29th. So we fell about 31.5%, which if you look at the 14 bear markets since 1947, the Post World War II era really, the 14 bear markets associated with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,18,2022-10-25 15:13:39
4038," the 14 bear markets since 1947, in the post-World War II era, really, the 14 bear markets associated with recessions, the average and what we call the trend mean, taking out the highest and the lowest, was 31.7, so we had a bear market, a vicious mauling bear market due to fed policy, but when we analyze all the fixed income currency, futures, political, economic, geopolitical factors, we come up with a view that if the Fed is not turning the dial to tighten every single day, that's effectively a second derivative easing. In other words, not raising the volume is a form of lowering the volume. And I don't think the Fed gets tighter than what's embodied in futures. In fact, I think futures are probably over-stated in May of 2023 at nearly 5% on short rates, inflation is going to come down. Any first-year economic student in college could do what we did. All you do is break down inflation into its sub-components and all of them point down. All of them. So Barry, does that mean that you're in the camp that you think the Fed could potentially pause some of these rate hikes because you think that inflation is starting to show some signs of moderating and that the Fed can't move to aggressively? Well, we look at GDP on a quarterly annualized. So we take the most recent quarter, we annualize it, multiply it to the fourth power. We annualize GDP. Well, let's annualize inflation. So CPI inflation for the three months ended September annualized was only 2%. Yes, it's 2%. So the momentum of inflation has already turned down. If you take the core, it consists of services. And that is shelter services. So that would be housing related. Those are already turning down. Yes, there's a lag, but they are turning down decisively on rents, home prices. You saw the data today. You look at non-shelter services. Wages are the key driver. And wages such as the Atlanta Fed, wage tracker, and average hourly earnings year to year change. And hopefully, on the 28th, the employment cost index all points down. So again, you have to steer the ship with a long lead time. The Fed knows that. And they've done their job. They flatten the curve by end of year. The curve will be completely flat, if not inverted in some points, obviously, tend to twos. But as they do that, we have to be ahead of that. We have to think, OK, well, the Treasury is worried about bond market liquidity. Treasury Secretary Yellen, former chair Yellen of the Fed made a statement yesterday. The Treasury is intently focused on bond market risk due to liquidity and other concerns. So if the market is always ahead of reality, we have to get ahead of that. And so it looks to us like there'll be a rally October to about April. I wouldn't overstay the rally. There are a lot of tail risks later in 23. But again, the market is always looking ahead. And we're trying to keep up with it. And I admit, it's a really hard job. So Barry, you mentioned some key risks there that could derail that upwards climb to 4,300. One of them being oil shots. What's the big concern there right now? No. The G7 and the West collectively are desperately trying to establish what's called a buyer's cartel on Russian oil. And naturally, and you can't blame them, OPEC Plus, which is OPEC's many member states plus Russia, they don't want with their sellers cartel to have a competing buyer's cartel. So they're not cooperating. And they shouldn't cooperate. That would just be a logical to expect them to do so. So the early December, there is this planned cap on Russian oil. That could create tremendous volatility. Russia has a lot of avenues. I personally would be thinking they might target the CPC pipeline out of Kazakhstan to reduce flows without cutting their own production to drive the price up. And if oil rockets higher, oil is at the core of inflation. This is what the ESG people never understood. They don't think they could stop again from whatnot. That's why what the captain said and that the whole system of oil like?""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,19,2022-10-25 15:17:36
4039," own production to drive the price up. And if oil rockets higher, oil is at the core of inflation. This is what the ESG people never understood. That all energy is, all GDP is the conversion of energy. And because of some of the dragging risks on GDP growth, demographics, debt, we don't have the kind of growth we used to have. And as a consequence, we need cheap energy. And so more expensive energy is not going to solve this problem. So if energy goes up, that's the core of inflation. That drives everything, including core CPI and core PCE. So we don't need an oil shock. And that's the risk here. You know, I remember the 1970s very well. We had a 73, 74 oil embargo. And then in 79, we had a second oil shock due to the shower around falling in Iran. We don't need that. And so geopolitically, I think we've got some very poor diplomatic policy out of Washington. And hopefully they don't drive us over the edge with a secondary oil shock, having already depleted the strategic petroleum reserve. Seinfeld Chief Equity Strategist, Barry Bannister, it's good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Well, partnership over Adidas is ending its massive deal with Yee, artist formerly known as Kanye West. Following a series of anti-Semitic remarks, the shoemaker, the latest high profile brand to cut ties with the artist saying it will stop production of Yeezy branded products immediately, as well as all payments to Yee and his companies. Joining us to discuss the implications we've got Brad Smith as well as Alexis Keenan. And Brad, let's start with you because we are trying to figure out what the financial hit is likely to be. I mean, we talked about Yeezy. I mean, Kanye produced products of what, been driving 8 to 10 percent of the revenue. Yeah, for Adidas, they're saying near term, this could be upwards of $250 million to their net income, but you also think about some of the tertiary dollars as well. We were discussing just last hour with Bernstein, analyst, Anisha Sherman, and the resale community as well. This could also take a hit in the near term. You think about companies like Stadium Goods owned by a company Farfetch publicly traded FTCH, I believe, and with all of that in mind, and how so many of those companies have looked across the product lines that have been the most hype beast X. Yeezy has been squarely within the fold, same to the success of almost mirroring the success of how well Nike dunks have done. And so for a brand that has largely fallen out of favor and seen waning favor over a core consumer constituent in Millennials and Gen Z recently losing or having this type of instance that hits on the brand in concert with what's already taking place with the deterioration of the brand could have a much longer term impact as well. There's been a lot of criticism about how long Adidas took to make this decision. I wonder if we have any idea about the financial hit they did take or they're likely to take not necessarily of the resale side that you're talking about, but you know how many consumers that look I'm just not going to buy this based on his remarks. Well his remarks let's just lay it out on the table. It was antisemitic. He had even prior to that going on rants and war t-shirts that were saying white lives matter and kind of in throwing especially within the black community where black lives matter throwing that on its head almost. And so for a consumer group that you have co-zied up to for so many years to now go and do the exact opposite. And what I was saying within our show this morning is he is now kind of shifted his entire brand in this era of influencer economy and said I'm going to pander into such a different direction that is hurtful to so many consumers out there and the population more broadly that now if you're going to continue that pander you also have to be comfortable with knowing that brands are going to step away. It's Adidas. It is JP Morgan. It is a company in CAA the creative artist agency and they're you're seeing on the screen GAP which he had had the partnership with Balenciaga and so this is far more ranging than just the financial hit of Adidas. It's all of those other companies as well that are going to see some type of impact in the near future. And Alexis I know you've been looking at sort of the legal side of things you know who actually owns the rights to reproduce some of the things that Kanye just designed. I mean where does that stand right now because it was just what last week if you be so or you heard Kanye coming out and saying look they can't drop me. Right and also demanding and posting on social media.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,20,2022-10-25 15:21:48
4040," Where does that stand right now? Because it was just what? Last week, a few of you were so reheard, God, I'm coming out and saying, look, they can't drop me. Right. And also demanding and posting on social media, expecting a $2 billion payout to terminate this deal. But look, I think we first need to put an umbrella on this situation to say, this is somebody who is outwardly expressed that they have mental illness since 2018. So these companies that are contracting with him as the sole owner of some of these brands, Yeezy in particular, they are contracting with a company whose chief is known to have expressed that he has bipolar. So there's some knowing this going into this. But look, that statement that you read going into the segment here with Adidas saying that after this review, they've decided to end production of the Yeezy branded products. Not necessarily the sale of them right now. It doesn't sound exactly like they're committing to that. But also saying that they'll stop all payments to Yee and his companies. It isn't a full blanket statement that they're ending it there, at least the way I read it. Now, these contracts, they're usually, in this case, there's a private contract. So we don't know what it says between Adidas and his company. But typically, they're licensing agreements where Yee is creating the designs. And then Adidas would own 100% of those designs. So all of the designs that would have been made under that contract, they would typically belong to Adidas. But I'll just caveat it and say, we haven't seen those actual words on that paper. We're not sure. These licenses, they can change hands, they can be sold, they can be assigned as well. Yeah, I mean, to your point about what he has said publicly about having bipolar, I mean, the whole conversation, I will say, just on a personal level, it's just a little uncomfortable, the word. I mean, not only the anti-Semitic comments that he's made, but you have seen a lot of these companies to your point, sort of understanding the situation, but going into an agreement, you know, knowing that there are still risks on this side. And I wonder, you know, bad or Alexis, both of you can weigh in on this. I mean, what is, you know, where does his brand go? His personal brand go beyond this. You could argue, you know, he moves away from the public eye, he gets some help. Who knows what's going to transpire, but compared to what we have seen in the past, I mean, this feels like the damage is really great. Yeah, and this is where it's a, if I may, the separation of a musician who has built up their brand on who they had been as a musician to what that actual brand has become as a result of the partnerships that move forward and the millions, billions of dollars that were thrown around to make his brand even more appetizing to a range of consumers, whether that be a range of consumers in apparel and fashion or whether that be in some of the other technological landscapes that we, he wants to operate. And this is still a person that's trying to buy parlor too. So his brand is clearly going in that direction right now with the commentary hurtful as it is, has been. And so he is fully delving his brand, fuller into that and even more full steam ahead into some of the hateful commentary that has been known to persist on a platform like that technologically. Well, and it runs counter, right, to the exact fan base that he builds. It's run counter to some of his own lyrics. Yeah, well, I mean, you're exactly right. When you go back and listen to some of his early albums, this is exactly what he real against and now he's become a part of that. So a story that really to your point sort of covers not just the music industry, the fashion industry, it has wide range of implications, but I may both continue to watch it.

4041,"scan.... to the New York stock exchange oil and gas investment vehicle. Granite Ridge making its market debut today via a SPAC, the company backed by former House Speaker of Paul Ryan, rang the opening bell this morning and joining us to discuss we've got Paul Ryan, of course, former Speaker of the House and Chairman of the Executive Network Partner and Corporation SPAC. We've also got Luke Graniteberg, who's Granite Ridge CEO and it's great to have both of you on today. Speaker, I want to start with you first because it's been a rough patch coming here. We were just alluding to some of the big exodus that you saw in terms of investors when they saw that you were partnering up with Granite. Talk to me about how you're thinking about this as you mark this milestone moving forward. Yeah, well, it's a pretty tough market for any company trying to go public. So we were very careful in who we chose as partners because we wanted to get it done and stick to the landing like we did today. So that's why we're very excited to be partnering with these Granite Ridge guys. We wanted to find a business that had very good balance sheet. These guys are unlevered. They got good free cash flow and it's in a very, very attractive sector of oil and gas. They're non-operating oil and gas platform company. So we wanted to find someone that we knew should go public and would be able to make it through the distance so that we're really excited to partner with these guys. Luke, when you think about the space oil and gas, certainly been very lucrative this year. We have seen some of these big oil majors hit key records in earnings as we look ahead to the winter and looking at the headwinds, whether it's within the U.S. but globally on demand as well as supply. How do you think about the investment environment in this space right now? I think we're starting to see just a lot more positive investors sentiment than we had for quite some time. I think that the storyline about oil and gas is really changing and you're seeing that transition to how important energy security is, energy reliability, both on the national and even more so now on an international scale. So it's been great. I'd say investor in-bounds were quite quiet for some time. But we're starting to see that pick up and folks that are really more interested in what we're doing. And look at what extent you see that accelerating going into the winter where we're really expected to see it crunch and supply. Well, I think that it's a great question, Kiko. And I really think that this is a defining moment. But the fact of matter is a really cold winter will create immense...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,22,2022-10-25 15:31:04
4042," Well, I think that it's a great question, Kiko, and I really think that this is a defining moment. The fact of the matter is, a really cold winter will create immense pressure on the global energy supply chain. And I think a lot of investors are looking at that, they want to prepare for it. And I hope that the takeaway is that this is something that we need to focus on for the long term, and that we're able to have some resilient investors in the space that are willing to stay in and truly understand what we can do in the big picture. And I think that we have to speak to the media, and we have to talk about the midterms, or what, just two weeks out exactly from where things stand. It felt like a month ago we were talking about this momentum for Democrats on some of the social issues, including abortion. The latest polls show a big swing in favor of Republicans and the economy. What do you think shifted in the last month? I think everybody knows we're in or headed to a recession. The last headline inflation numbers, core inflation numbers, were really high. So I think people got more concerned about their pocketbooks, about jobs, about what the economy is going to look like, than they were about social issues. I think you're right. I think the Democrats peaked probably in August, maybe early September. But now I think people are much, much more concerned about the direction of the economy. Democrats are not, they don't poll needle as well in the economy. I think they try to wreck it basically, with Bill Beck better. I'm not a big fan of the inflation reduction act. And they try to do much worse tax policy. They didn't. So I think what voters want to do is set a check on Washington. They don't want one party rule by the left. And that's why I really feel pretty confident in saying that we're going to win the House. And I think we got a really good chance to win in the Senate. And I think in large measure, because voters want to check on all this left-ward lurch, and they want some calm economic policies. And so that's why I think we're peaking at the right time. That's why I think the momentum is with us right now. And so yeah, two weeks out, I feel very good, much better than I felt, say back in August. Obviously, you know, we watched the midterms always to see a gauge of where things could go two years from now in the presidential election. We've seen some headlines recently where you said that you believe the former president Trump would be unelectable, come 2024. And yet we're looking at some very competitive races in places like Arizona, places like Pennsylvania, where there are Trump-backed candidates who are polling pretty well. So what do you make of that disconnect there? I mean, why do you think that's been the case if you don't know that? Not him. They are not him. And look, we lost the House, the Senate and the White House, in the span of two years with Trump. Never before is my party lost as much that fast. So my point is, come 2024, we want to win. We want to beat Biden or the Democrats, whoever they're running. And we know it's just a factual statement, polling wise, we are worse off with Trump as our nominee than with somebody else. So I just think it's going to be palpable in 2024 that because we want to win and beat the Democrats, we know as a party we're better off with somebody else to be our nominee, to more guarantee a victory because we know we lose with Trump. It's the suburban voter, they're the big difference maker. I can tell you in Wisconsin, 64,000 Wisconsinites voted for all the Republicans on the ballot and not Donald Trump. That gets translated across the country in the swing states. It's a huge difference maker. So I just think from just winning, we are going to want to win come 2024. And that means we need to elect somebody to be our nominee that's going to better deliver a victory. And I think it's going to be pretty well known at that time. Luke, when you think about what's been playing out in the energy space, there's been a lot made of some tensions between the Biden administration, as well as the oil and gas companies in terms of the lack of investment or at least as the White House sees it. If in fact these predictions hold, we're talking about a Republican majority in the House, potentially in the Senate. How do you see that shifting that strategy around energy moving forward? The goal and what we really hope to accomplish is just a rational conversation about energy. What you're seeing in particularly midterm season, you just have folks that are taking one extreme side, one of the other, either piter carbons need to go away forever or how do carbons need to stay forever. The fact of the matter isn't as Speaker Ryan has said this before. We needed all of the above strategy. And to get there, we just need a rational conversation. I'd say that's the most frustrating part for folks that are in the industry. You've got hundreds of thousands, millions of people that are coming to work every day working hard trying to create oil and gas to create energy to provide energy security and reliability.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,23,2022-10-25 15:34:50
4043," For folks that are in the industry, you've got hundreds of thousands of millions of people that are coming to work every day working hard, trying to create oil and gas, to create energy, to provide energy security and reliability. And then you go out and the president of your country is condemning you for doing that. And it's not fun. I really hope that we can create a more practical conversation where we can have a real dialogue about what is the best way, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, to power this country and to power the world and the growth of anticipated things. Yeah, I would just say, Kiko, look, American oil and gas producers are the cleanest producers, the most efficient producers. This is really good for American jobs. It's good for bringing inflation down and it's very good for foreign policy to be able to give our allies access to our oil and gas. And by the way, gas is a great bridge fuel to a lower carbon future. So I think it's an attractive sector. I think it's very good for America. And I do believe that my friends in Congress, when they take the majority, which I think they will, understand this. And they're going to bring some more common sense conversation to the whole energy discussion. Let's talk about one more thing that could potentially flare up again, depending on the outcome, we should say, of the midterms, the debt ceiling. This is another fight that could potentially emerge as a flashpoint, come 2023. You're a veteran of that. And I wonder how you're thinking about the Republicans using this as leverage. Do you think they should be, or is it time to abolish the debt ceiling altogether? I've been through so many debts. I can't even count how many debt ceiling fights I've been through. America is going to keep its full faith in credit. We're not going to re-knick on the debt. And yeah, always. Democrats have done this to Republicans. Republicans have done this to Democrats. It's a moment for a fiscal, it's a fiscal impasse moment where you should get a down payment on good fiscal policy. I was on the Bulls Simpson Commission, which Democrats held hostage in order to get a commission during the debt limit debate. So we've had spending caps on debt limit debates. We've had so many fiscal policies being attached to debt limit because you don't want to just keep rubber stamping more borrowing. You want to try and get some kind of policy in place to get the curve going in the right direction. Try and bend the curve on debt. We will have a debt crisis in this country in the not-to-distant future if we don't get our fiscal house in order. And so I think it's a very important point. Having said all of that, I'm very confident that the U.S. dollar is secure and that our bonds we paid and that the full faith in credit of the United States government is going to be intact in this divided government that we're likely to have in the future. Paul Ryan, former Speaker of the House and Chairman of the Executive Network Partnering Corporation SPAC and Luke Brandenburg, Granite Ridge CEO. Thanks to both of you today. Really appreciate the time. Thank you, Keith. Well, coming up, easing the pain, China Central Bank looks to capital inflows to shore up a slumping yuan, making it simpler for domestic companies to raise funds from overseas.

4044," We are located on the versch first Volvo Jan6n That´s really cool This is the final Perfect the Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live or some of you seeing some of those gains pick up here in the session with the Dow up nearly 300 points now for more on today's Friday's Friday market action. Let's go to Jared Blyckery at the Wi-Fi interactive and Jared, you've got your eyes on Bon Yield, especially on the shorter end of the curve. That's right. The shorter and the let's put this to the 13 week T bill yield. This has just been racing higher and that is because it tracks the federal funds benchmark and that is on the very short side. And so we know that the fed the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates at a faster clip than previously thought blah, blah, blah 75 basis points in November in another week 50 basis points in December. And let's check out the chart here. This is over the last three months. Now the rest of the yield curve heading down in a pretty quick fashion today. We'll show that in a second, but just wanted to show you the relentless trek higher here by the 13 week T bill yield and it has been doing this all throughout the month of October here. There was just a brief respite in the second half of September. And let me just show you a max chart. These are the highest levels that we've seen since October of 2007 coincidentally, that was when the stock market peaked about a year before the financial crisis, the global financial crisis. Now here's a five year T-note yield. We can see that is racing higher as well, although it is backing off 14 basis points. Huge volatility, by the way, in the bond market like we've been seeing 10, 15 basis points per day, that spills over to equities. It's very difficult to manage these highly leveraged positions in the currency and bond market and have stocks up. Nevertheless, stocks are up today. So you can see 30 year T bond yield, very similar story, all of these things coming off multi year highs. Now, let me also show you what's happening in the currency market because US dollar taking a little bit of a breather today. Let me show you all of this. If it's red, that means the dollar is down versus these various currencies. But we've seen this relentless trek higher by the US dollar versus, for instance, the Japanese yen. We have this big bank of Japan meeting this Friday that Kiko Yuenai have been talking about, Karota the head of the bank of Japan. He's out in April, but he's been saying he's gonna stand his ground. Nevertheless, 28% increase in the dollar versus the yen creates a lot of pressure over there. Another pair I've been watching is the Chinese Yuan versus Japan, the Japanese yen. That could get some kind of a reset here. So all kinds of things possible as we've been saying day after day in the currency market, spilling over to equities, but today everybody, at least on the equities side, looking green. Yeah, and we got that headline from the PBOC as well making it sort of easier to borrow from overseas and that points to the pullback that we have seen in the Yuan level as well, at least on short trade. Jared, thanks so much for that. Let's switch gears and go back to shares of general motors. A company we've been tracking all morning here. That stock is up three and a half percent after the company posted a big earnings beat but maintained its guidance for a deeper dive in the auto space. Let's bring an auto blog editor in chief, Greg Migliore, Greg, good to talk to you today. We were kind of diving through the numbers with our auto correspondent, Praz earlier, who said, look, it feels like at least with the GM story, things have started to turn the corner, things are looking a little better on supply chains, the chip shortage in terms of inventory. What was your big takeaway from the numbers we got this morning?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,25,2022-10-25 15:43:48
4045," things are looking a little better on supply chains, the chip shortage in terms of inventory. What was your big takeaway from the numbers we got this morning? Sure, well, good morning. Thanks for having me back. General Motors had a record third quarter for revenue based on profitable sales. It trucks of SUVs in North America. They really got the supply chain under control, which quite simply allowed them to make and sell more vehicles. It really, you know, wasn't a rocket science. It all really came together for them in the last quarter. They also had a lot of good publicity too. They had the reveal of the GMC Sierra and the Chevy Equinox electric vehicles. Even the Chevy Bolt, which is their smaller electric crossover in car, had strong salesdubers. And it bounced back from some recall issues that they had had previously. So this is basically General Motors near-term strategy. Sell lucrative trucks of SUVs to fund the electric vehicle programs. And they do this while consumers and sort of the company figure out what's to come next as far as EVs. And how do you see demand shaping up, especially with some of those EV trucks that you say will be the revenue driver that accelerates the transition or the company's transition to all EVs? I think of the next couple of years, you're going to see demand really increase for some of these vehicles from General Motors. They're really targeting high-volume segments, like the Sierra and the Silverado. These are full-sized pickup trucks. They already sell a lot of vehicles with internal combustion engines in these segments. So quite simply adding some electric versions. I mean, it's really a part of the market where they can capture and grow market share. And that's actually what they did in the third quarter. They, their market share hovered around 16% which was up from about 13% a year ago. Now that might not sound like a lot, but in the auto industry, it's so competitive just to get even a sliver of market share. So to me, that was another sign that things are going in the right direction for General Motors. Looking ahead here, Greg, we're going to be watching for numbers out from four. This is another one of those legacy companies that has gone through a lot of transition in the process of going all electric, including staff cuts. How do you think that's going to be reflected in the quarterly numbers? I think it'll be a little too early to tell as far as some of the moves that they've made just in the last couple quarters, how that will shake out for Ford's bottom line. What's interesting to me is how they're setting up their electric vehicles and their internal combustion vehicles is almost like separate units. And they're going to break those out and display those numbers in the future. I think that'll be painted in an interesting picture as far as where Ford is right now and where they're going in the future. It's a very creative approach to accounting to reporting financial numbers. So we'll be looking to see how that lands. Okay, that's stock at least getting a lift from GM's numbers today to AutoBug Editor in Chief Greg Migliori. Good to talk to you today. What is now time for our chart of the day? And today, we are honing in on the West Coast as I like to call it the best coast. The state of California poised to overtake Germany as a world's number four economy moving up the ranks just behind the U.S., China and Japan with recent data and flying California's already $72 billion ahead of Germany when you account for the state's recent growth rate. Now this chart we're watching from Bloomberg points to the diverging paths. Europe's largest economy, the largest economy in the U.S. have taken. California has 379 companies with a market value of at least a billion dollars. Germany has just 155 when you look at the top 10 firms in each region. California companies, including Alphabet and Apple. Yes, a lot of those tech names have outperformed the German ones on every metric. On the macro front, California's economy is also ahead of Germany's with its unemployment rate at 3.9 percent compared to Germany's at 5.3 percent. We should point out by the way, California also the unemployment rate there coming down from Texas, which is of course second largest economy in the U.S. It's the first time that's happened since 2006. While coming up seeking AC's fire, 30 Democratic House members urge President Biden to shift his strategy on the Russia Ukraine conflict. All this comes just two weeks before the midterms. I mean, warnings, there were no longer be a blank check. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,26,2022-10-25 15:47:47
4046," Two weeks before the midterms. I've been worrying. There will no longer be a blank check. That's next. � oblivious to the Come 2024 we want to win. We want to beat Biden or the Democrats, whoever they're running. And we know it's just a factual statement polling wise. We are worse off with Trump as our nominee than with somebody else. So I just think it's going to be palpable in 2024 that because we want to win and beat the Democrats, we know as a party we're better off with somebody else to be our nominee, to more guarantee a victory because we know we lose with Trump. That was former House Speaker Paul Ryan talking about their Republicans. Where the party stands going into 2024 elections before then, but before then we have to go first to the midterms, economic indicators that best predict the fate of the Democratic Party are pointing to a gloomy or outlook than desired. More on this we have Yahoo Finance, Rick Newman who's on top of the latest poll numbers. I mean exactly what the former House Speaker was also pointing to saying he's feeling pretty good. I guess the question is if the Republicans take the House, how big will that majority be? And we're getting closer to what might look like a red wave that seemed to be receding just a month or six weeks ago. Now it seems to be going the other way. So I saw an interesting piece of analysis. Everybody's been focused on gas prices. Us and everybody else, the Biden White House follows this almost by the minute. And those have come down that has worked out for a present by now around $380, well below $4 a gallon. Moody's Analytics has an interesting piece out and they say there's a strong correlation, not so much between gas prices, but between what happens with real disposable income. Real incomes adjusted for inflation a month or two or three before the election. And by this measure, things look terrible for Biden. Real incomes, depending on how you measure it, but on a year over year basis, almost at record lows. And there's some COVID distortion in there, but you can kind of factor that out. And what's happening is the rate of inflation is now 8.2%. Paychecks are only going up by about 5%. So inflation is just going up way more than pay. So people really are falling behind. Purchasing power is falling behind. That does not normally happen. oh, that could happen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,27,2022-10-25 15:52:31
4047," And paychecks are only going up by about 5%. So inflation is just going up way more than pay. So people really are falling behind. Purchasing power is falling behind. That does not normally happen. That's really unusual. And that is probably what voters mean when they say they're really concerned about the economy. Yes, gas prices, but a lot of other things too. Yeah, and it sort of comes down to, well, how much of my wallet is taking a hit every time I go out and buy groceries? Forget the fact that the labor market's strong. You know, it's not necessarily how voters sort of break things down. There's an interesting headline that came out yesterday, the progressive wing of the House Democrats putting out a letter, essentially calling for a shift in the stance for what's playing out between Russian, Ukraine, essentially saying that there should be a blank check. There should be some kind of negotiation. I mean, this is a shift from where the Biden administration has been pushing for. What's the strategy here? Well, I don't know if there is a strategy. This may have explode. It's ridiculous. And it's really stupid. And I think the 30 Democratic progressives who signed this really wish that they had this letter had never gone to the White House and they started walking it back right away. Basically what they're saying is, let's continue to think that there could be a diplomatic solution here and that we could somehow negotiate with Putin. Putin himself could have written that letter. And the reason is, Ukraine's army is kicking Russia's ass on the battlefields inside Ukraine. So of course, Putin would like to say, hey, before we lose any more territory, let's see if we can negotiate a solution here, which in theory would keep Russian forces occupying the parts of Ukraine they already have. And Ukraine has momentum and they've been making a lot of progress. The Russian army, by some measures, is falling apart in Ukraine. So no, this is not a time when you would negotiate with Putin who is dishonest and is a thief anyway. I mean, he wouldn't live it. So Putin would love to cement all his gains through some kind of negotiation with the United States. So what these 30 Democrats did is they kind of weakened President Biden's hand. And the moment this letter became public, you had a lot of other Democrats, mainstream Democrats saying, this is all wrong. Now, of course, Republicans are happy to sit back and let Democrats score an own goal, as you would say in soccer, two weeks before the midterm elections. This was just a completely foolish move. Yeah. Especially ahead of the midterms where we've already heard some of the Republicans saying that maybe we're not going to give a blank check to Ukraine. So a debate that will continue. Rick Newman, as always, thanks so much for that. Coming up on the other side, Warner Bros. Discovery could encourage as much as $4 billion in restructuring charges. So how much content could hit the cutting room floor? We've got Ali Canal on the story after the break. This is how the Party, especially the generation of four Democrats to sit back and really listen a lot to開心. And they'll just even think for it to win more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,28,2022-10-25 15:56:46
4048," natuurl Well, no question downsizing comes with a cost. Warner Bros. Discovery planning to incur between $3.2 billion and $4.3 billion in pre-tax restructuring costs for 2024. That's according to a new SEC filing. We've got Allie Canal on the story for us today. And Allie, the question is, after what's happened with Discovery, are there more projects that are going to be cut? Definitely, because a bulk of these charges are on the content side of the business between $2.5 billion are tied to restructuring that part. So, thank you, you know, the cancellation of the Back Girl movie that was supposed to be on HBO Max. That's gone. There's a lot of projects in development that they had to cut. They physically went and removed certain movies and shows from the platform. And ultimately, this is because David Zazov wants to keep his promise to Wall Street slash $3 billion worth of costs over the next two years. We've seen a significant amount of layoffs as a result of that. Most recently, the company's television studio cut 26% of its head count. So not the brightest picture heading into earnings next week, especially as we have this overhang of mechroconomic headwinds like foreign exchange pressures, as well as losses and subscribers for linear television. So a lot to think about for this company. Yeah, I've heard more and more from people who were saying I'm thinking about cutting some of my streaming content to save costs. So it'll be interesting to see what kind of commentary we hear on that front. Thanks so much for that, Ali. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. We've been seeing all three majors in the green right now with a doubt up to 175 points, big tech earnings on tap after the bell today. Microsoft and Alphabet is what we're watching. Well, we got all that covered for you right here on Yahoo Finance. And we'll meet later next week. All right. You're looking for those havings pretty, you had just had an update today. Excuse me.

4049," The housing market and climbing mortgage rates could be pushing more perspective buyers back into the rental market. Our next guest says this makes it the perfect time to invest in residential areas of the commercial real estate market. Let's bring in Nouveau and real estate global chief investment officer Carly Trip. Carly, good to see you this morning. So where should investors look in this backdrop? You know, I think that with all the data coming out, we're looking at a moderated home price appreciation scenario. And I think especially with the chart you just showed and mortgage rates ending the week last week above 7%, so even higher than that chart shows. That's going to continue pressure on the ability to buy and sell a home. And so what that's going to do is increase the demand for rental housing. Wow. Okay, that's not good news for me, a renter. So with all of this in mind, on the existing home side, you've got this conundrum as well, because people aren't necessarily jumping to list their homes or add that inventory to the market knowing that there might not be prospective buyers out there right now because of the rising rate environment. 100%. I mean, inventory levels, keeping a cap on inventory levels is going to be the saving grace of the housing market no doubt. So the data that we saw last week, the data that's coming out this week, existing home sales, pending home sales, inventories, under units under construction, et cetera, percent increase just from one year ago. Carly, when we do get the sense of that Fed pivot, how does that change how you put money to work? The sense of the Fed pivot, if they start to temper back their rate hikes, what happens? I think is that the US is really, really strongly positioned right now to have a foothold in the global economy. So we took a much more hawkish stance on our central bank policy and what that's resulted in is this currency destabilization across major markets throughout the world. And I think given that the US is really able to export energy, we can supply our own food, we can supply our own manufacturing, we are the second largest manufacturer globally. That's setting up the United States to be well positioned to come out of whatever cycle we are going to see over the next 12 months. So as a real estate investor, I would definitely focus on the US and I would focus on more non-sickical inflation linked assets such as housing, industrial, healthcare, related assets, et cetera. So this home builder confidence from which you're tracking, is that starting to improve or show any signs of alleviation from the declines that we had seen because delivering a house fully at this point, given some of the logistics and supply chain challenges, that has been cited, that's been noteworthy and impacted that confidence. Yeah, absolutely not. Absolutely not. I do not expect home builder confidence to come back anytime soon. As you saw, it's plummeted and it's expected to continue to plummet with that will result in for investors like us as an opportunity actually to scoop up some new inventory and master plan communities. I think prices that will be well below what we could have seen last year. How long after the Fed sees what it needs to on the housing side and home ownership side, do you believe that it will take for actual rental prices to start to come down? I think rental prices are going to start to come down. So if you just look at certain simplistic stats, like home prices to wages, that index is well above a normalized mean. That is not a good indicator. I think that leads to a softening in rents. Also if you look at just inflation numbers, particularly score CPI, shelter accounts for 40% so an increase in shelter costs. So there is going to be continued pressure to get those prices down, particularly in the rental market and the home market. But I would say that if you look across your rental options, single family rental, we're really seeing a lot of tempering in new starts and under construction versus multi-family, which is continuing to outdo historical numbers. And have been real estate global, even.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,30,2022-10-25 16:05:32

4051," DR especially e-commerce related offerings. There is an integration with Shopify. There are other others like that out there. That's what you have to prove. And you have to start monetizing these ventures where you are not seeing ads right now, especially Spotlight, which will draw some of these tick-tock budgets, you know, think about, you know, like also other video budgets coming live with respect to Netflix and Disney Plus and so on, which will draw a lot of the linear TV budgets over into digital and they are likely also going to end up in some of these social media networks. All of the social media networks right now are trying to become the shopping mall or at least replace them need for going to physical retail and drive more conversion. Can they successfully fill the void where perhaps that in-person shopping experience can be offset by that virtual shopping experience driven by interest and then actual purchase decisions. And do you see that actual amount of money that's going to be spent on this platform on these platforms improving over the near term as well? Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a few things that need to happen. First, we have to work on friction. Friction between looking at products, buying them, after-sale service with respect to messaging integrations and so on. And these platforms are working on that. You see that was picked to messaging functionality on WhatsApp, you know, in the meta universe, and we are going to see more of that. The second thing that we need to see is more integration of inventory. So literally everyone of these social media platforms has integrated with Shopify now. There are many more similar offerings like Shopify out there to think about like a WooCommerce, for example, and so on. These need to happen and need to be smooth as well. And you have to think about like combined baskets so that a checkout experience, you know, might work significantly easier than it is today. And then lastly, when you also think about all these ID headwinds that we're having and Apple's ATT is just the beginning, right? You have to think about like SDK runtime on Android, you have to think about cookies disappearing for many of these retailers. Both OmniChannel and smaller DTC brands, it is becoming significantly harder to track from an ad to a conversion if there is not an on-platform checkout functionality embedded into that. So the more we are going towards in that direction of IDs disappearing, the more likely we're going to see adoption of these on-platform functionalities and that should increase the shopping that we're seeing on these platforms. Okay, and so with so much of that focus on shopping, being either prompted by the consumer data that the companies, the social media platforms are looking at or just by the trends of how many people are just comfortable spending their money through a social media platform. Does that mean that there's an authenticity vacuum with legacy social media right now? If everybody's just trying to sell me on something and content creators, I know that they're in partnership with someone who wants to get my dollar at the end of the day, then where do I go to actually just have that valuable connection? Yeah, I mean, if you think about some of the larger retailers out there, right? So name Amazon, name Etsy, name eBay. All of these have an issue that they don't really have any social media connections or offerings on the side. Amazon might be with Twitch, but still small compared to other social media networks. But what all of them have and throw a Shopify in the bucket as well is they have huge audiences and they have huge intent and conversion data. And if that sort of data can be made actionable into these social media environments and that brings us into the discussion of clean rooms and privacy laws and so on, but if that data can be made actionable, then we're not going to be overloaded with shopping related ads and it's going to be likely significantly more targeted than we have seen it so far. Okay, all right. Perhaps just my own sugar in the night inserted there into the conversation. We're gonna take research, senior analysts, and Rocker Strauss, we appreciate your analysis of all these companies and breaking that down for us this morning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,32,2022-10-25 16:14:09
4052, you you all eyes are on big tech this week with apple amazon and meta plus alpha bed all set to report earnings but how will this impact ETF investors that if i head of research tod Rosenbluth joins us now to discuss okay so help us break this down i mean with regards to some of the ETF trends that we've seen thus far what are inflows looking like into tech sector ETFs well the technology sector has been relatively strong in 2022 we've seen over six billion dollars of money go into technology ETFs that's following on with some of the more defensive sectors so we've seen strong inflows into consumer staples strong inflows into utilities health care has actually been the leading sector whereas discretionary and communication services sectors have seen net outflows and as we tie into the big tech earnings that you talked about it really matters what ETF we're talking about and whether how it's classified tall where do you see investors gravitating to more specifically in the in the tech are they still staying clear of anything that owns a social media stock i think what the real focus for them is understanding what is inside these portfolios so we mentioned earlier meta and alpha bed are reporting results those are classified as communication services companies in many of the sector ETFs so you would find that in xlc which is a communication services selector spider ETF but you would not find meta or alpha bed within the technology selector spider which is xlk or the vanguard information technology ETF vgt because of those these sector ETFs are tied to the gix sector framework and s and p and msci classified companies like apple and microsoft as technology companies like meta and alpha bed as communication services companies and so the devil is in the details as to what's inside these portfolios so with regard to all of these big tech names it's still going to come down to what their free cash flow looks like and and where their mer maintaining margins within their businesses some of them very much advertising focused or all of their businesses advertising whereas some of them have a little bit more at play with regard to amazon there and so what would you be watching kind of throughout the tech earnings to see where they're maintaining some of those margins so i think the focus for all of these companies we're likely to see the currency headwinds happen all of these companies are multinational in nature it's different how their exposure happens to be but we've had a strong u.s dollar that is going to weigh down on overall profitability it just comes down to how profitable they were before the currency impact and so a company like apple which is again in the technology sector and part of vgt or xlk the demand for iphone is going to be important a company like meta of course it's tied to search you're going to have different impact uh... at search as well as social media you're going to have a different impact as well so i'm not an expert on individual companies but i do think investors are looking to get exposure to these companies through the diversification benefits of an ETF and they need to know what's inside those ETFs taught us anything surprised you this earnings season i think it's been better than,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,33,2022-10-25 16:18:23
4053," through the diversification benefits of an ETF, and they need to know what's inside those ETFs. Todd, is anything surprised you this earnings season? I think it's been better than we've seen and expected. I think financials has been relatively strong and you get exposure to financials through the financial selector, spider ETF and through bank oriented ETFs like the spider S&P bank ETF. I think that's been relatively strong. The bar tends to be set relatively low, heading into earnings season and companies have been exceeding that roadily low bar, but we'll see what happens. And again, ETF investors get the benefits of diversification across the sector as opposed to having to pick an individual winner heading into and after earning season. Do you expect that any of these companies will either revise downward their guidance or pull guidance? I don't think we're going, I don't have the expertise to be able to dive into individual companies, but what tends to happen when companies report results, they tend to beat the expectations and then the guidance takes a look at where we are from an economic perspective. And so the dollar is likely to continue to be strong or likely to see the impact of rising interest rates, impact the overall economy and recession has been top of mind for many companies. So they're more likely to lower the bar and again seek to exceed that during your earnings season, giving investors something else to watch beyond the current forecast, looking further into the future. I wish you were here Todd because the big energy is flowing on this desk between me and Brad, we are psych frapp earnings. This is a big, big week of earnings, always an exciting time for all of us. Vetify head of research Todd, Rosemblitz, good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. All right, switching gears here. The Internal Revenue Service announced a welcome cost of living adjustments to the US's marginal tax rate that will increase the take home pay for many workers in 2023. Joining us now with more on the latest tax brackets is Blue Ocean and Global Wealth CEO, Margarita Cheng. Margarita, good to see you here this morning. So what do these changes mean to the average consumer? So this is actually a positive. Who would have thought inflation is positive, but because inflation has been at the highest level in 40 years, what that means is you could find yourself in a lower tax bracket because the IRS has raised the income level. So you could be earning the same if not slightly more and still end up in the same tax brackets. OK, so all right, help me understand this. Like how quickly does this go into effect? I mean, is this just immediate? Sure, I definitely can understand. So I know that we just finished taxes in April. There are some people who filed an extension so they just submitted their 2020 return October 15th. And I know we're in 2022. And 2022 is not over, but we are planning for 2023. So here's the takeaway. The US tax system is not a flat tax system. It is progressive. It's graduated. So there are. As you can see on the screen, there are seven tax brackets. The lowest is 10%. The highest is 37. So I want people to understand is if you find yourself a certain [""Why me unholy έlann dans le wi wrth van introduced sf futus laughing anh for the interest of b",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,34,2022-10-25 16:22:59
4054," on the screen there are seven tax brackets. The lowest is 10% the highest is 37. So I want people to understand is if you find yourself in the middle 24% tax bracket, that does not mean that you pay 24% on all to 364,000 dollars. You pay 10% on the first 11 then from 11 then it goes up. So that's what we mean by graduated from the last year. So my this does go into effect for 2023 and the reason why it is going into effect is the IRS has made adjustments. I don't need to tell you all that inflation is real and this is based on costs of goods and services for 80,000 items. Okay, and so with all of this in mind, how does this actually impact the real take home wages for people? Does does it? Assuming your income is the same and your income has not gone up, you very well could be in a lower tax brackets. The other takeaway is the IRS has raised the standard deduction. So they have raised the standard deduction for somebody who is single by $900 and they've raised the standard deduction for somebody who's married by $1800. So what that means is you certainly can have a higher tax rate of $1800. So if you're not able to get the standard deduction, what if your itemized deductions do not exceed the standard deduction, you'd be better off taking the standard deduction. So that's essentially how it can impact everyday individuals and families. Marguerio, since these changes have come to light, what are some of the biggest questions you've gotten from your clients? So the first question is, and this was surprising for folks. So what can we do about this? How does this affect me? So the first thing I've told people is that the IRS tax with holding calculator, just because you don't want to be unpleasantly surprised. So the first thing is check that out. And if you do need to adjust your withholding, you want to complete a W4. The other thing that people have asked about is the limits. The IRS has increased the 401k contribution limit by $2000. So that is a very significant increase. So for individuals under 50, they can now contribute $22,500. They can also contribute 500 more to an IRA or Roth IRA. They have also increased their contribution to a health care flexible spending account. The thing that has been shocking for people who have young children is the dependent care spending account amount has not been adjusted. It is still at $5,000. So this is how it has impacted individuals and families. All right. Our taxes. For retirees as well. There you go. Thank you so much for breaking this down.

4055," Well, it is shaping up to be a big week for the broader tech story with the likes of Apple, Amazon, and Metta all reporting in the coming days. Until now, a big revenue miss for Snap and signs of a dire online ad market has been the major warning sign for the space. The NASEC has plummeted over 30% since the start of the year outpacing declines for the S&P. The sector has also been contending with what my next guest calls a COVID hangover because of tech over investment. Let's bring in Erica Klauer, a Jemisin associate tech equity portfolio manager, a lot to get through to this week. But let's start by looking back to what happened last week. We saw the huge sell-off coming on the back of Snap that has accelerated concerns about a decline in online ad spend. How much of that are we going to see reflected, especially in Metta and Elphabet? Well, we talked a little bit about the fact that a lot of the advertising at SnapChat has basically been a result of share loss. I think relative share gainers will be companies like Google, like Facebook. Nevertheless, there is a lot more pressure in terms of justifying the price of advertising online that I think will persist throughout 2023. And so when you look at somebody like Elphabet, what we have learned, at least from the past few quarters, is that they are a little more diversified when it comes to this online ad spending. So obviously, it's not like Snap, where we're just talking about one particular app, you know, a specific market. Does that shield Elphabet for some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in a company like Snap? I think you're absolutely right. Google is much more diversified than a Snapchat is. And Sam goes for Facebook as well. What about Amazon? They have made making a lot of big in roads, especially in the advertising space. That's right. I think Amazon has done a very, very good job with its advertising assets. And I expect that that division will continue to outperform and gain share. So how do you think investors should be looking at that? We'll sort of break down Apple separately, obviously, that there's a lot to get into there. But when you talk specifically about the stocks that are really affected by digital ads, and we're seeing a pullback in general, who's best positioned? Who do you stay away from? Well, I think overall spending will be somewhat pressured because there is a need right now to really look at all costs amongst all enterprises. There is rampant inflation with regards to labor costs and also input costs. So clearly, people are going to be scrutinizing their advertising budgets more than ever. However, in that context, the companies that are really executing and gaining share would include Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Let's talk about Apple. There's the obvious numbers that we look for in terms of where their demand is on iPhones, how they're expanding in services. But there's a larger story that I think a lot of investors are looking at that puts Apple right in the middle. And that is supply chain movements. We were just talking about China and the concerns that persist around there. Apple has a big presence. They've been trying to move production into India away from China. And then there's this big tech control crackdown that the Biden administration has put forward that does affect Apple and where they source their chips. Well, if we take a giant step back, what we're looking at this week is accumulative 7 trillion amount and market value of companies reporting this week amongst the big tech players. The advertising companies are in one bucket and then of course, they're the hardware and software companies in the other bucket, including the likes of Apple. And what I would say about Apple is that the company is executing extremely well. But it is not immune to the the trends that you just mentioned. It took decades to basically consolidate all of their manufacturing in lower cost regions. That's being undone right now as the supply chain is being diversified. So ultimately, that is inflationary in its nature. And at the same time, we have a much more difficult demand environment where many people bought their smartphones. They bought their personal computers during COVID. So there's not that dramatic need that we've seen over the last three years to upgrade or even to attract the first time buyer. We can talk about the shift in where manufacturing is happening, where you source your supplies. What does that specifically mean in terms of inflation? Are we looking at higher prices down the road?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,36,2022-10-25 16:31:35
4056," Explain me in terms of inflation, are we looking at higher prices down the road? Is it going to be cushioned by the company just given the cash pile that they have? How do you see that being reflected in the coming quarters? Well, there are companies that are just masters of their supply chain. Apple would be the poster child for that. However, I think that when one is thinking about duplicate efforts to ensure no disruption to supply chain, that inherently means higher costs. And so the company will have to really assert its pricing power in order to offset those higher costs. I think that's going to be a story over the next couple of years. Still the strongest name though in the big tech space? Absolutely. I think Apple is showing very strong gains in market share. Even now with its dominant position, it's still outpacing its peers in terms of adoption. Eric, a cloud-wide genocent associate, technology equity portfolio manager. It's good to talk to you today. Appreciate your time. Thank you. We are beginning this hour though.青回合 such as persistent COVID-19 curbs and global recession risks. We should point out that that stocks lower in greater China on investor fears of Xi's new term, favoring ideology, driven policies over growth, the Hang Seng and Hong Kong Capt. It's worse day since the financial crisis in 2008, and the Shanghai Comp also down about 2% there. Major Chinese tech names also falling into the red on concerns about Xi's embrace of state-owned firms versus private companies. We've got a panel for you to break it all down for us. We've got China-Bajibok co-founder and CEO Lila Miller alongside Keith Crack, his chairman of the Crack Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue. Gentlemen, this great to have both of you on today. Lila, let me just start with you on the reaction that we got overnight in the Asia session here. Certainly, it looks like investors not feeling very comfortable with which direction China is now heading in with Xi securing his third term. What do you make of this sell off? Well, it's not altogether clear whether markets believe China's economic data this time around, but what's pretty clear is that nobody was very happy with the way that Xi packed the new leadership with loyalists. I think there was always a desire to see somebody who symbolized more market openings, disagreements in the top leadership, some sort of fulsome pushback against COVID-0. Look, you can read to leaves a million different ways here, but when you look at who he put up next to him, it looks like it's going to be the Xi show with very little pushback against him. I think that worries people who have watched the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,37,2022-10-25 16:36:00
4057," here, but when you look at who he put up next to him, it looks like it's going to be the she-show with very little pushback against him. And I think that worries people who have watched the crackdowns of the last two years. Leland, just to follow up there, I mean, this did seem very much like a focus more on sort of national security, not necessarily on economic policy. And I know we don't come to expect that at the party congress, but we're still looking at a growth rate here, well above that 5.5 percent target that was initially set out for the year. What does that tell you about where the economic priorities are for the third term for this president? I just think the economic priorities have completely changed from this time around. You know, we've been taught as China watchers to see the party as prioritizing growth above all. And that has been true for the last 5, 10, 15 years. It is not true anymore. Now, the China we're looking at right now led by Xi Jinping is one focused more on security. It's focused more on restructuring the economy, so there's fewer vulnerabilities for the party in terms of reckless credit expansion, the property sector, shadow, finance out of control. They want to take control of the economy, reroute the economic growth model. And to do that, they have to materially slow down the economy, stop pumping credit in. So things are changing dramatically. They're not forgetting about the economy, but the Chinese economic growth model, as we know, it is over. And they're shifting to a more realistic stance. Keith, certainly from the U.S. perspective, a lot to watch here in terms of the language that came out of the party congress. One thing, certainly those in Washington watching here, the changing in terms of the language with the party's constitution here, specifically on Taiwan, using the word strengthened, fighting spirit and ability, deterring any kind of separatists, or saying that they are, in fact, still moving in the direction of reunification. Why don't you take away from this party congress in terms of the timeline China is now thinking about in terms of reunification? Well, I don't think there's any doubt. Keith go that she is committed to that. You know, she is not only the most powerful dictator since Mao, but he's probably the most powerful dictator in the world since Hitler. And you know, he's probably even more dangerous. So I think a question for your viewers is not just what are, you know, what's the data, what's the analysis? Leeland is one of the great experts of the world on that. The question is, we know what's happening. There's no limit to his ambitions. So the question is, in terms of business boardrooms, what are you going to do about it? And what are the moral responsibilities? What are the fiduciary duties that shareholders have to mitigate risk with these board members have to mitigate that risk for their shareholders? And you know, I've spent a lot of time with the corporate boards out here in Silicon Valley. And all of these folks are putting together China contingency plans because they see the crackdown on the private sector. They see the draconian COVID lockdowns and they see no limit to his ambition for power. To what extent have those risks been elevated because of that consolidation of power that we saw over the weekend? When you said that you're talking to companies and their boards, what do those contingency plans now look like? Well, they cover a number of things. First of all, they cover supply chains because if there's any bottlenecks there, they all saw that during COVID. So that was a wake up call. The other big wake up call was when cheese totalitarian twin, put invaded Russia and 300 companies had to come out. They lost hundreds of billions. The China problems 10 to 20 time X that. So there's a conflict in Taiwan. It's not only disastrous for the business community. It's catastrophic for the tech business because of Taiwan's lock on semi-conduct. They also see the risk of cheap nationalizing firms, nationalizing, not being able to get their money out of there. But the also big question now that's popping up, Akiko is these crimes against humanity. They're committing in places like Xinjiang, United States and several other countries. I'll take a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,38,2022-10-25 16:40:26
4058," in up a key goal is these crimes against humanity. They're committing in places like Shinjong, United States, and several other countries have labeled that genocide. So there's a real moral issue because they export that slave labor all throughout China. And we have already seen legislation here in the U.S. to crack down on some of that. Leland, last question to you. You know, as you know, these party congresses are very closely orchestrated every single detail. It is really, doesn't go without a hitch. And yet we saw what was kind of an awkward moment here, where we saw the former president, Hujin Tao, being escorted out. He's sitting right next to Shinjong Ping there. It appeared at least that he didn't want to go. And there's been a lot being made of that. You know, what exactly was the message Shinjong Ping was trying to send if it was, in fact, that? What was your read on that moment that we saw over the weekend? You know, it's hard to know for sure. You know, we know that it was a pretty big humiliation for who. But are we absolutely sure this is part of a public urge of the Communist Youth League faction, which barely exists anymore? That's not clear at all. Who's son was in the room? He's in the Paul Burrow. So I guess if we track his career over the coming months, we'll be able to get indications of whether this is something that was specific against who, or was some other dynamic. But very weird, was such a choreographed event. It is weird to have a spectacle like that that left people talking all weekend. So we're going to have to watch the politics the next couple of months to see what this was all about. OK. I appreciate you both joining us today, China-Bajibok, co-founder and CEO, Lila Miller, along with Keith Krock. He's chairman of the Krock Institute for Tech to Policy at Purdue. The biggest earnings week of the quarter is upon us, the What have we learned thus far? What have we heard from our business leaders? Yeah, I think that right now, business leaders are really focused, obviously, on the prospects of recession. And people are watching that very closely. See, looking for signs whether or not the economy is tilting into a recession. What we're seeing so far, though, is that consumer spending is held in really strongly. You're hearing from banks, especially at the beginning of the earning season, that consumers are still spending a bit consumer spending is up, double digits still year over year. And so there's strength in the economy at the most fundamental level, which is the consumer. And yet you have deteriorating company confidence, I think among the CEO is thinking that they need to be preparing for recession. So at a high level, that's what we're really saying right now. You just got into that point. I want to bring up what Goldman Sachs, the CEO David Solomon did say shortly after.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,39,2022-10-25 16:44:46
4059," I was thinking that they need to be preparing for a recession. So at a high level, that's what we're really saying right now. It's gotten to that point. I want to bring up what Goldman Sachs, a CEO, David Solomon, did say shortly after the earnings were released. He said on the distribution of outcomes, there's a good chance that we have a recession in the United States comparing that to what we've heard from other bank CEOs, other executives. How does it stack up just in terms of the likelihood that we will see a significant slowdown? Yeah, that's a great question. I think David Solomon has probably been on the more bearish end of CEOs, bank CEOs, especially for the last several quarters. I think that it's easier to find a more negative comment from David than from some of the other ones. Obviously, Jamie Diamond has been notably bearish talking about a hurricane could be coming through the economy. And I would say that Brian Moynihan has been on the most bullish side at Bank of America, of any of the bank CEOs. And that has proven the same case during this earnings season as well. So Brian Moynihan was one who reminded that the consumer is still very strong, relatively Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan CEO David Solomon and Jamie Diamond were both a little bit more bearish. And I would say that David Solomon has been the most cautious of anybody, which maybe isn't too surprising because Goldman Sachs obvious has the largest capital markets business of those three, whereas Bank of America would be touching consumers more directly. Right, right. It's not just their interpretation. Some of them certainly have different business models. Let's move over to the consumer. And what we're learning from them, here's the MX CEO. We're confident. Look, the spending speaks for itself. I mean, just look at some of these numbers. You've got goods and services up 16%. Our US consumer is up 22%. Millennial spending is up 39%. Our teeny spending is up 57%. International spending is 37%. We haven't seen any change. And you can look at this quarter over quarter. And the reality is that, you know, S quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending. And this is like, I don't know, billion dollars behind or something like that. But if you look at year over year growth, we're not seeing any changes in consumer spending behavior at all. A remarkable statement given inflation was that an outlier statement? Or does it really sum up what we're hearing? No, I think it sums up honestly with what we're hearing from consumer credit card companies, especially, which is really the most important indicator because credit card companies are obviously seeing all of the spend that consumers are doing, not just in certain categories. And the numbers that they're seeing are significant. So you heard an American Express talk about double-digit increases in some major categories. And so I think what's important and why we focus on what's going on at the credit card spending company, or the companies with credit card data, is that in some of the other areas of the consumer sector, we're seeing slowdown. And you're seeing this shift from goods back to services that still playing out post-pandemic. And the card companies are capturing all of that. But if you just listen to certain segments, you may see decline in good spending or boosts in service spending. But the card companies are encapsulating all of that. And it's got another big theme. Obviously, is this strong dollar? We've heard it not only this quarter, but of course over the past several quarters, when you take a look at the dollars jump up, nearly 17% this year alone. I want to play a quick clip from what we heard on Netflix's earnings call after the results. The FX drag is significant. We mentioned in the letter, if we look at, you can do the math on our four quarters now, when you kind of roll it out to a full year number, we're still holding to what we're calling FX neutral to the beginning of the year, January 1 of this year, to that 19 to 20% margin range. FX neutral, you'll see it's actually is in the mid to higher end of that range. But on a reported basis, it's just a little over 17%. So there's about two and a half points of FX drag in our margin that equates to about, it's about a billion dollars of revenue drag, about 800 million dollars of margin drag. That was Netflix, a CFO Spencer Newman. And Scott, we've heard it from a number of executives, IBM, one of the big companies, obviously.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,40,2022-10-25 16:49:00
4060," Spencer Newman. And Scott, we've heard it from a number of executives, IBM, one of the big companies obviously outwiring about the strong dollar their CFO saying it's a big wild card to what's going to happen to the US dollar. Obviously having a huge impact on their business. I'm sure we'll hear it more this week when we hear from some of the larger tech giants. What's on your radar as we look out over the next couple weeks when it comes to the strong dollar? Yeah, I mean, I think the strong dollar is one component, one major component that's impacting earnings growth in this quarter. And I think that's one of the big things that we're seeing this quarter versus previous quarters is that you're really starting to see earnings growth get impacted by some of the headwinds that we've been seeing in the economy. So the dollar is one and Netflix pointed out there. Proctor and Gamble also talked about a nine point headwind just from currency in its most recent quarter. But then also Proctor and Gamble talked about a 27 point overall earnings growth headwind, which again, 27 points is a massive number in terms of the growth headwind. And that was not just in terms of strong dollar, but that was also just the general inflationary environment, both in terms of their input costs and then also their free and delivery costs. And so those things, you know, that what we've been talking about thematically in markets and capital markets for a long time, I think are starting to actually hit the financial statements of companies in this quarter. And that's really important for two reasons. Not only is it it's impacting and showing where the economy is going, but as we think about what multiples to give to stocks, to equities, and ability to repay debt for companies as well, capital markets can get get impacted a further lag here by by decreasing earnings and some of these dynamics finally flowing through. That's great stuff. The transcript editor and avidale asset management founder Scott Kraseloff, appreciate it man, thanks. Markets plunging today in Hong Kong after Chinese leader Xi Jinping solidified control over the ruling communist party and secured an unprecedented third term. Some of four founding editor at large Steve Clemens joining us now for the first time on Yahoo Finance. Steve Good to see you. Let's first talk about the context of US-China relations given that the Biden administration just really ramped up that trade war with trip restrictions to China. What does Xi's continued rule mean for US-China relations? Well, I think it means that we're at an inflection point and Xi Jinping is reading the global map as one in which he sees America in strategic contraction. That made it feel differently than how we see things in Washington or New York, but that's what he sees. And he sees this as a time when China's got to get back to ideological purity, back to territorial reacquisition of parts of China that had previously been with it like Taiwan. And that part of the message here is that while Deng Xiaoping, a previous Chinese leader, leader said it's good for China to be rich. Well, now China is rich and it's going to get",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,41,2022-10-25 16:53:22
4061," message here is that while Dunjiao paying a previous Chinese leader said, it's good for China to be rich. Well, now China is rich and it's going to get back to ideology and that is very uncomfortable for markets and many of the transnational firms that are based there. So I think from a US-China perspective, it means competition and challenge are coming. If we're not already in it actually, it's gonna be a fight over standards and we're gonna be fighting over that rising global middle class in the world. Steve, you mentioned the reaction that we're seeing in the markets and markets are certainly taking this news very hard. You look no further than some of the largest US-listed Chinese companies in terms of that reaction today. Do you think that's justified? Well, I think it's, you know, I think markets fall when there's not trust in the future and there's doubt and I think there's a lot of doubt right now on how much Xi Jinping is going to be friendly to this. You know, look, we all have this view and I did two at one point, a couple of decades ago that the more China got interwoven into the world trade organization, became dependent on Chinese trade. Hell, US debt, that it would become a better stakeholder in world affairs. Well, it turns out that equation has some wobbliness to it. And I think right now it looks like China is not going to be increasingly like us or the West. It's gonna set standards in a new and different way. And right now it's one of the reasons it explains why Xi Jinping is so focused on consolidating power. He does not want to be challenged. He knows it's gonna be rough and he's gonna be asking his people for a lot of sacrifices as he basically takes on the West, in my view, for more leadership in world affairs and more consolidation within China. None of those are friendly to markets. He has cracked down on big tech leaders there in China, our prior guest Linda Düsseld essentially said he does not care about the economy in the short term. Can you put that in context for us? How a president would not care about the growth of their economy? Well, I think right now he has been focused on corruption. He's been focused on other elements. And you know, at one level, you know Xi Jinping has this theory of what he calls great power relations or what it means for China to be great on the world stage. And that does not mean making Ali Baba rich. That means taking the power and assets of China, which he thinks are awesome. And basically throwing all of his support behind that. But he's a bit disdainful that China's power is dependent upon, you know, its assets and markets being managed all around the world. I saw him in Davos a few years ago and this was right when the Trump administration that came in and he gave a remarkable speech and which he said, don't worry world. I'm going to be the one to protect markets and the market trading system in the world and I'm going to be the one to save us all from climate change. And it turns out that part one, he's not living up to. So when you take a look at the fact that Xi Jinping has been so strict when it comes to COVID, the number of the COVID zero policy, the number of lockdowns that have been instituted in China over the last two and a half years. I guess though at what point will he need to start listening to the Chinese people, those that are sick of these types of policies and that and we're obviously seeing that play out in the economy today. Well, it's really interesting because he's just elevated a number of people that were responsible for that policy. So I don't predict any real weakening of that and I think it's going to be complicated for China as it tries to reopen next year. I mean, I think we have to be very careful of mirror imaging with China that we would say, don't they want to risk back? Don't they want their people back? Don't they want to have all of the benefits that come with transnational traveling, exchange and tourism? Sure at one level they do, but the obsession with state control, the obsession with making sure that you have to understand by basically shutting China off, it's also become much, much more vulnerable to a future variant or something. You do not have the antibodies, the natural immunity that has built up in places that have been hit hard by COVID. So just some degree, China's got a staggering problem ahead in that it is basically created a Galapagos Island problem for itself where its own population is now less prepared for a future variant from COVID than it might have otherwise been. And I don't know how they'll handle that. All I know is that this is a person very, very comfortable with asserting...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,42,2022-10-25 16:57:41
4062," for a future variant from COVID, then it might have otherwise been. And I don't know how they'll handle that. All I know is that this is a person very, very comfortable with asserting a lot of control over people's lives. That's good stuff. What does the third term mean for Taiwan? And if they're to take Taiwan, they do it by force, they do it by economic blockade. Well, look, I think that we have to be careful with Taiwan. I do think there are things that we could do or they could do that could trip us into war and it would be a very, very nasty war. And there are geographic realities with Taiwan that are very complex. But look, I think that China is of the view that it's incremental growth, the increasing investment it's made in its military power, its naval power, it's looking at how it is focused on what it could do by way of a blockade and others. I think we have to be very careful and remember that Taiwanese themselves may not, in fact, want this show down, some do, but some don't. And I think we need to make sure that they're in the picture or 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors come from Taiwan. China wants it back, but I think right now, we're basically trying to figure out is the era of strategic ambiguity over Taiwan, which has actually been stable. Is that coming to an end? And this is one of the areas that could lead to an actual kinetic collision between American forces and Chinese forces if we're not careful. And I think it is one of the real hot points in the world. And I think Taiwan is in a vice between them. And we don't have many Henry Kissinger's around to kind of put this deal back together. No, we do not. Speaking of competition, Steve, wanted to hear about your outlet, Semaphore. It's an interesting tech play. I'm just curious how you guys position yourself in an increasingly competitive media environment. Look, we love all of our sibling organizations are out there working in the new media space. We launched about a week ago. We had, I think, largely really good reception from across all the verticals we're doing. I help anchor and host the politics and policy division called Principles. So if you'll be to sign up. But look, the big thing we're trying to say is there is a crisis out there in trust and confidence in news. It's also a market opportunity, honestly. And if we can come back to educating and interacting with the American public and the global public, frankly. And so it's important to hear Steve Clemens' views on things, perhaps, or my analysis of the news scoop. But I've got to be responsible to the fact that there are alternative views and opinions out there. And we build that in. We build in a disagreement. We build in international perspectives into what we're doing. We show people that you can look at the facts in the scoop out there, but you can get a lot of different views out there and you should demand it and expect it in your media. And that is not, as you know, what is typically happening. You're able to do it in the broadcast format much, much better than the typical print and journalism world that we're in. And so by building in alternative reviews, by building this in, I think we'll have a richer and more trusted news form down the road. And I look, you know, I encourage people to check us out. Steve, you're talking to a guy who worked at Fox News and CNN, man. So I get it. And I appreciate very much what you're doing. Thank you. We do look forward to following some of them. Of course, I'm a feeling we will be talking much more about that in the future. Steve, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us.

In 2005, Browder was denied reentry to Russia and later became a victim of a Russian government scheme to undermine his firm, he says. Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer hired Browder to investigate Russian corruption, was arrested and died in Russian custody. Bill, welcome to influencers. Thank you so much for joining us. Great to be here. So much to get to right now. I want to ask you maybe first of all about Vladimir Putin. And have you ever seen Putin reverse course in 25 years of Washington closely? Can you see him changing his tack now in Ukraine? Now that he's committed to a full scale invasion. That's the most important question of our discussion. And the answer is definitive no. Vladimir Putin, can't you have to imagine his world is the world of a prison yard. In a prison yard, you can't show any weakness. If someone comes at you with a shank, you've got to shank them 10 times more and look around at everyone else and say, who else wants to be shanked? That's Vladimir Putin's mindset. That's how he operates. And so when he has embarked on this horrific military invasion, there's no chance. Anytime he announces peace talks, that's just a tactic to either split up the resolve of the West or to delay some action to resupply or something like that. And so he is going to move forward. He's going to escalate. There's no retreat. There's no compromise. There's no diplomacy. He's all in it for victory. However, he defines that. And so a lot of people use this phrase endgame bill, but I'll ask you. I mean, what is the endgame here, specifically with Ukraine first? And does he want to occupy it or how would this work in his mind? Well, this is really another important part of Vladimir Putin. There is no endgame. So what you have to understand is he is not there for all the reasons that he says he's there. You can't believe a word he says. He's an in-veterate liar. His credibility is zero. And so any words that he has used to describe what he's doing should be discounted. The reason that he is in Ukraine is because after 22 years as a dictator, he sees the writing on the wall. He sees the writing on the wall, meaning that the Belarusian dictator next door was almost overthrown 18 months ago by his people. The Kazakh dictator, again, and next door in a different direction was overthrown. And Putin realized that it was just a matter of time before the Russians overthrew him. And so pulling straight out of the dictator's playbook 101, he said, what do you do to not get overthrown? You start a war. And he's described Ukrainians as Nazis and drug dealers. And he's described NATO as an invading force and all sorts of things. He doesn't believe any of that. He's just trying to come up with a narrative to give the Russian people something to chew on in order for him to have a war. And his war is there to stay in power. And so when you say, what is his endgame, there is no endgame. His endgame is to move forward, to expand, to attack, to take territory, to declare victories. But he has to keep on going no matter what it is. And this is just part of that process. And it's not like it just started now. I mean, the most recent version of this just started now. He was feeling under pressure in 2008. And that's when he invaded Georgia in 2014, the same thing. He took Crimea. And so this is a long process of him trying to stay in power as a dictator. And the most scary part of this whole story is that I don't have any belief that he will stop. So let's just say that he's successful in Ukraine. And that's a very big...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,44,2022-10-25 17:06:23
4064," story is that I don't have any belief that he will stop. So let's just say that he's successful in Ukraine. And that's a very big question because the Ukrainians are valuably fighting back. But let's say he was successful in Ukraine. That's not the end of his story. He would then go to other countries. Maybe the easy ones, maybe the hard ones, maybe grabs Moldova at some point. But his ultimate goal for him is to show up at the border with us, which means Estonia or Latvia, Lithuania or Poland. And then to test out something that has never been tested before, which is are we ready to go to war? Is the United States ready to go to war with Russia to protect Estonia, a country of a million people that probably 2% of Americans could locate on a map? Are we ready to do that? Or are we not? And he's taken the bad, but we're not. But isn't this going to be very difficult for him just to hold on to this real estate? I mean, look at Afghanistan, very different country, certainly, but look at Afghanistan under Brezhnev. I mean, there's a huge cost to occupying these countries, right? Absolutely. So I was just saying, I was saying, that's his assumption is just keep on pushing out. Now, let's talk about Ukraine specifically. So he's launched an invasion of Ukraine. We don't know the exact number of casualties, but I've read various reports to say that there's 3,000 soldiers have been killed in the first four days of their occupation. I don't know if that's true or not. Maybe it's wild the exaggeration. Maybe it's totally true. But let's just say for a moment, let's just take for a moment and say it is true. That's the total number of soldiers that died in the entire war with Chechnya. That's like a third, or between a quarter and a third of the total number of soldiers that died after nine and a half years in Afghanistan. And so he's paying a hefty price, even if it's just a fraction of the 3,000, he's still paying a hefty price for what he's done so far. And we're just in the in the early stages of this game, the Ukrainians are not going to are not going to roll over. They're going to fight like hell. Thankfully, now, after some resistance, all of the major Western allies are going to assist them with equipment to help them fight and and give them some decent chance. But at the end of the day, Vladimir Putin is way outgunned them. I mean, he's got all sorts of stuff. There was I mean, shocking military hardware that could really, you know, be unbelievably destructive and to the people in Ukraine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,45,2022-10-25 17:10:48
4065," you you you you and it and repeating it and repeating it. So by the time the Russians invaded, there was no alternative narrative. So the way the Russians normally do this, and they did this with Georgia, for example, there was like confusion to this day about who fired first in Georgia, and the Russian apologists said, well, it was the Georgians who precipitated and provoked this war and so on and so forth. There's no uncertainty about this. This was a war of aggression, and that's a very important term. A war of aggression is a term they use in the Nuremberg trials. This is a war of aggression that everybody can agree on. And so there's nobody who can know sort of natural Russian apologists, nobody who's got a lot of financial interest with Russia, who can say anything other than this is a brazen attack on a peaceful neighbor. And that's an extremely important part of the narrative that has allowed all the Western countries to lock arms and do the coordinated sanctions that have been done right now, which are causing enormous financial pain to Vladimir Putin. Let's drill down into that Bill sanctions. How effective are they right now? What grade would you give them, for instance, and what do we need to do from here? So I'm a sort of connoisseur of sanctions. It's such a thing exists. And so when they first started this sanctions program about a week ago, last Tuesday, I would have given the Western governments a two out of ten. It was all very, you know, too little too late. Then the atrocities started to happen and the sanctions started getting real when they added the major Russian banks, big oil companies, et cetera. By Thursday, it was an eight out of ten. Then they did Swift. That's a nine out of ten. And then they did Vladimir Putin and nine and a half out of ten. So there's still some gaps that need to be filled in. Swift is only done, so Swift means disconnecting the Russian banks from the international financial system. And they've only done 70% of the banks. And so logic would tell you that if 70% of the banks are disconnected, they'll just route all the payments through the 30%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,46,2022-10-25 17:14:51
4066," Russian banks from the international financial system, and they've only done 70% of the banks. And so logic would tell you that if 70% of the banks are disconnected, they'll just route all the payments through the 30% of the banks that aren't disconnected. That's just what anyone would do. And certainly the Russians will do that. And so we need to sanction the other 30% of the banks and a lot of people ask me why why are those banks protected. And I can imagine that there was some, you know, ugly backroom deal with, you know, in a smoky room where somebody said we have an interest there, don't do that. But so those other 30% of the banks need to be sanctioned disconnected from swift. And then the most important part of the whole exercise is that Vladimir Putin's own money needs to be hit. And his own money is held not by himself, but by oligarchs who look after it. And so we need to freeze the assets of the oligarchs in the West. And a lot of announcements have been made that that's that's the intention. A few oligarchs have been added to the various EU, US, UK sanctions lists. But that needs to be done in a much more coordinated manner. Because there's different oligarchs in the US that have been sanctioned in the EU and different ones in the EU than UK. And then a list needs to be expanded dramatically. So there's 50 or 60 or 100 of the most wealthy oligarchs in Russia sanctioned. And we get. God, let me interrupt. I'm sorry, Bill, but practically speaking, how would that be accomplished? Isn't that extremely difficult? You've got camons and, you know, countries like that. And I mean, the Spheres and them specifically, there are all sorts of money havens around the world. Nevermind, Switzerland, which is said that actually there, there are up against Russia at this point. But how would that be done practically. And it's actually not as complicated as you think. So the so it's not the government's job to necessarily track down the assets. So what happened the way it works in practical terms. As a person gets added to the sanctions list. Once they're on the sanctions list, then it's the job or the responsibility on the job, but the legal responsibility of a bank that holds their money to no no longer transact with that person. So that money gets frozen. Or a real estate agent not to not to sell their property or a broker not to sell their shares. And at that point, everything gets frozen. And so it actually gets crowdsourced. Now you made a good point, which is, you know, let's say their stuff is not in the United States or in the UK, but in the Cayman Islands. Well, guess what? The Cayman Islands is is a crown dependency. And as a result, every one of these, um, Gernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, they copy the British sanctions list. And so you end up in a situation where, where whatever Britain does, all these offshore jurisdictions do. And so Britain is really punching way above its weight in terms of its importance in this, in this whole scheme. And so just coming back to the original thought you put a person on the sanctions list, they get sanctioned everywhere. And so, you know, the Cayman Islands, BBI UK, and if all the countries coordinate, then there's really no civilized place they can hide. Now, we're seeing oligarchs scrambling right now moving yachts. I read a story about one oligarch, whose park is yacht in Saudi Arabia. Okay, as he doesn't think that the Saudi Arabians will freeze his yacht. And, and their stories about mad scrambles of oligarchs trying to sell properties, give them away to family members and getting divorced from their wives. And they're giving them property, all sorts of interesting stuff. And that will happen and, and they will probably succeed in protecting some of their assets. But even if you don't get all their assets, just having a person on the sanctions list means that they're no longer that they're pretty much out of the game. They're benched in the world in the international financial world. Another remarkable development, or correct me if you think I'm wrong, Bill, is the, is the response by the private sector, both in Europe and in the United States. I mean, everything from Disney to Shell to the banks, curtailing or ending their financial relationships with Russia. What do you think about that? And is this effective? Well, in a certain way, I would almost argue it's more effective because, okay, so the, you know, the sanctions lists are important government activity is important. But if every Western company stops doing business with the Russians, it's, it's, it's some, it's really dramatic. I remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for sort of game, Magnitsky, my murdered lawyer, one of the first people people I met with, I was, I was in South Africa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,47,2022-10-25 17:19:23
4067," And remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for Surgay Magnitsky, my murdered lawyer, one of the first people I met with, I was in South Africa, and I met with a woman named Helen Zilli, who was one of the people involved in the, one of the main people involved in the anti-partied movement. I watched a movie called Cry Freedom, and she was one of the characters in the movie. And I met with her shortly after Surgay Magnitsky was murdered, and we talked, and we talked about how they ended the partied, and she said it was all about disinvestment. It was all about the US and Western Europe disinvesting from South Africa, that when they became financially isolated, that's when it became too much. And so I think this is really, really important. And I think this is probably, as I look at the next steps, what can we do next when we watch these atrocities unfold in Ukraine? I think it's just to pressure every single Western business to divest, to stop doing business, to stop supplying goods, to stop supplying services to Russia. Right. Are the sanctions enough to send the Russian economy into a recession? And is this an objective that we should try to achieve, even? Well, if you had asked me two months before this whole thing had started, I would have said, let's just go after the oligarchs and leave the Russian people alone. We have got no beef with the Russian people. They didn't do anything. They don't, the most Russian people don't want this. I would say, I would say the vast majority don't want this. They don't want to send soldiers into harm's way to be killed and mangled. They don't want to have to pay 100% more for food and imports, which they're not even going to get anymore, no more imports. I think the average Russian person doesn't want this. And so I wish that we had done this before, which, and possibly, you know, sent Putin a message, how costly this would be in a real way that he went to understand it. So he wouldn't have invaded. But we, he has invaded. And so now we have to say, okay, what's the strategy going forward? And the strategy has to be to raise the price as high as possible. And most importantly, to just deplete Vladimir Putin of resources so that this war becomes so expensive and he just doesn't have the money because the central bank reserves are frozen, the exports are not generating any income, no more foreign direct investment at all. And so we're in a situation where he just can't afford it anymore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,48,2022-10-25 17:24:15
4068, you you you you you I want to get to your personal background a little bit bill to have a fascinating story we talked about a little bit with your firm and and all of your trials and tribulations in in Russian investing there after you're ordeal battling the government in Russia you became a global champion of the Magnitsky Act which allows the U.S. and other countries to sanction foreign officials involved in human rights abuses validating or infuriating to see the need for such laws at a time like this both but but but but but most interestingly so we we pass the Magnitsky Act works for human rights abusers and corrupt officials it was passed in 2012 and and it completely blue Putin blue his top when he when he saw this happened and I mean really just like I mean and and and and the most emotional way he banned the adoption of Russian orphans by American families and retaliation in the the orphans that were being adopted were the the ones who were not well and Americans was still take these children back to America and nursing to health and they attended a die in the orphanage so he is effectively sent in orphans to death in his own country as a retaliation against the Magnitsky Act and everybody was crashing their heads and saying why is this guy reacting so harshly and the reason is we can see it today literally today which is that this was the basis for which all of future sanctions were controlled on asset freezes and travel bands and every say every person that's now going to be sanctioned will basically be sanctioned on the basis of the Magnitsky Act and the reason he was so upset was because he knew he's not stupid he knew that eventually the Magnitsky Act would come for his money and so there's a direct line between the murder of surge Magnitsky my campaign for the Magnitsky Act the sanctions that were put in place and the sanctions that are now going to go after Putin's money in 2018 Putin mentioned you by name during a press conference with then President Trump offering to allow us investigators to interview 12 Russian intelligence agents identified by Robert Mueller's probe in exchange for allowing Russian intelligence to question you and others close to you Trump and what are you called it an incredible offer what is your view of the way Trump reset US relations with Russia and do you think it affects the way the world approaches Russia today well thankfully I think that the Trump situation was an aberration not I don't think it was like a permanent damage to the relations between the United States and the rest of the world and I don't think it it certainly hurt the US credibility for a short period of time but we can see right now in the multilateral approach towards sanctioning Russia that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,49,2022-10-25 17:27:58
4069," And I don't think it certainly hurt the US credibility for a short period of time. But we can see right now in the multilateral approach towards sanctioning Russia that things continue to work as they should. I mean, it's pretty horrifying the idea that an American president would hand over me and a bunch of US government officials to Putin because Putin asked for that. I mean, it's just unbelievable, really. And it also seems pretty unbelievable. It took him four days to walk it back. And it was only after the Senate planned had a vote, whether or not to hand us over. And they voted 90h0 about 20 minutes before the vote, Trump through his press secretary declined Putin's offer. But if Trump had been reelected, so that was during the Mueller probe. So if, yeah. And so he was sort of under the spotlight as far as Russia goes. If he was reelected, I wouldn't have been able to travel back to the United States because surely he would have handed me over to Putin. And so I, from a personal safety standpoint, I breathed an enormous sigh of relief when he was defeated. And final question, going forward, what sort of work do you see yourself doing? And what sort of legacy do you see yourself leaving? Well, the legacy that I'm in the process of leaving is a legacy where Sergei Magnitsky's name is on legislation, not just in the United States, but now in 34 countries sanctioning human rights abusers, not just in Russia, but all over the world. And so the Magnitsky Act now applies to Chinese officials involved in the genocide in Jingjiang is involved in sanctions, Iranians, Myanmar officials, all sorts of bad actors all over the world. And it creates a big disincentive to human rights abusers and to kleptocrats. And it also creates some redress for victims. And for me, the Sergei Magnitsky's murder is a burden of guilt that I carry with me everywhere because he was my responsibility and he was killed in my service. And so every day that I do something to enhance his legacy and to do that in a way that potentially will offer other victims' redress and save lives is sort of my project. And as more and more countries do this, then the next step is to have more and more countries use the Magnitsky Act against bad actors. And so Sergei Magnitsky will from the grave and from heaven be helping everybody else out in their terrible moments of distress. Bill Browder, CEO of AirMitage Capital Management and head of the global Magnitsky Justice campaign. Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you. Even watching influencers, I'm Andy Sirwer. We'll see you next time. Welcome back to Yow Finance. I'm Brian Saaz, alongside Brad Smith, Julie Heiming. Has the day off. It has been an earnings heavy morning. But let's lock in on some breaking news crossing the wires just about right now. As you see, all three markets up higher on this. That is consumer confidence, Brad, coming in from the conference board. Yeah, that's right. 102.5 is the reading that we just had come in from the conference board here. And as we're continuing to look through some of the data and get it all refreshed on our side, this is particularly interesting to see how the markets will react to this as we move on throughout the rest of the day right now. The Dow Jones industrial average is still seeing that hold on to gains, still net positive, by about half a percent, a little bit more than that. The S&P 500 still holding on to gains. That's up by about nine tens of a percent. And then that's that composite. That's been the leader largely throughout the day here. And that's up by about one and a half percent at this point in time. But again, consumer confidence coming in at a reading of 102.5 here this morning. We're going to continue to see if we get even more of the data that rolls in from this report. And we can add a little bit more context to this as well. Yeah, consumer confidence. Interesting, Brad, you look at these quarters from Coca-Cola, a Sherwin Williams, these companies are out there raising prices. And the consumers by and large, they've been able to withstand these prices. Yeah, but this is still a miss on what was actually estimated here. We were looking for 105.9. So coming in at 102.5, the markets right now still holding on to some of the move higher than",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,50,2022-10-25 17:32:26
4070," Missome, what was actually estimated here, we were looking for 105.9. So coming in out, 102.5 of the markets right now still holding onto some of the move higher and of course this is kind of permeated from yesterday's trading activity. And even last week with this little Bipity Bop bounce, if you want to call it that, where we have seen, of course, in this larger bear market, at least these bounces in the near term, and a larger question of where consumers sit within that and where the strength of the consumer is, where demand is actually coming in from. And I think that's a lot of really what's spelling out how competent the consumer really is at this point in time. You see demand is far different regardless of with the industries that we're looking at. Demand for travel, far different than demand for even Coca-Cola as we're talking about. Even though you may see it actually show up in the results and outpace some of the expectations, the expectations for the companies on the equity front have actually been lowered. So it's a question of where will the consumer continue to see some of that strength even as we're continuing to discuss the risk of recession too? All right, let's stay on all things economy and the consumer. Strikingly, different tone from shipping giant UPS this morning on its earnings report, compared to longtime rival FedEx. UPS showing good growth in the US and reaffirming its full year guidance ranges. This comes on the heels of FedEx badly whipping on earnings and on corking a fresh restructuring plan just a few weeks ago, UPS CFO Brian Newman just got off his earnings call and joins us now. Good to see you here, Brian, as always, just for the lay investor out there. These stories between a UPS and a FedEx are now strikingly different, like I just mentioned. Why do you think you and your team are out executing a FedEx? Hey, Brian, good morning. It's great to see you. Listen, we have a mantra around here, which is control, which you can control. And we've been really focused on doing that over the last couple of quarters. The macros have been challenging domestically and particularly internationally. But we've been focused on with softer volumes across the world, really. How do we ensure we drive the right pricing mix and dynamics and also control the cost by doing that? You protect your margins and deliver to the shareholders. And Brian, I just want to stand that before we jump onto the broader quarter. So you're not out there closing sorting facilities, laying people off. I just want to make sure I have it right. So we are tightening the belt. Certainly at the corporate, we spend a lot of money in GNA. We've been tightening the belt there, but we've been doing that for a couple of years, trying to right size the business. Carol introduced a better, not bigger strategy to the company and what that really is, optimize the volume that comes into the system. So it's more profitable and then take the cost down. So we have been certainly right sizing the business over the last couple of years. But no, we're not closing sorting facilities right now. We have the ability to take our variable and set every variable cost down should the case arise. And so where are you seeing continued strength within the business and the customers that you're servicing right now? That's a great question, Brad. The healthcare segment is a particularly strong one. We're doing very, very well there. The, as you think about the small and medium business, that's been a core focus over the last couple of years. We've been addressing the capabilities that those customers want. And by doing that, you create a wonderful environment for a very profitable customer. So we've been focused on the SMB, small and medium business, the healthcare segment. And then overall, trying to look at that international business because there's lots of growth opportunity there for us. We've been talking a lot about FX headwinds that companies are seeing right now. And when you think about that international business, of course, UPS is going to be rolling out some pricing increases. This also impacts the international segment in December, I believe, and that really going to be reflected as you finally get into 2023 as well. What is your anticipation around where the consumers and the strength that you were just laying out where they'll continue to take that price increase? So we announced a price increase for next year at 6.9%. That's supposed to be representative of a combination of inflation as well as the service we provide. So that will help drive the base rate in terms of the pricing equation. As we think about the currency impact that you mentioned, Brad, the currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business. But we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. Brian, I recently spoke to another Brian Cornell over a target for our all-market summit conference last week. He said the holiday season is, is season expecting to be pretty good. What's your read on things? So Brian and I used to work together at PepsiCoast. So I know him and target is a very important customer for UPS. I actually think it's going to be a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,51,2022-10-25 17:36:47
4071," Pretty good. What's your read on things? So Brian and I used to work together at PepsiCo. So I know him and Target is a very important customer for UPS. I actually think it's gonna be a decent peak season. We're ramping up right now. We're hiring. We hire over 100,000 people for the peak season to get ready. And with customers like Target, we're out there committing to them that we're gonna be there with the excellent service that UPS provides. So I think that Brian, the peak season, our peak season volume goes up 50, 60% from a normal run rate. So it is a meaningful increase. But as we think about peak this year, you don't have the low inventory levels that we saw last year, which drove an earlier peak. People were rushing out to buy because they were afraid the inventory wouldn't be there for the holiday season. This year, inventories are much higher at the retail stores. So I think it'll be a bit of a later peak, Brian. All right, competing against Santa Claus like efficiency there in the logistics business. When you think about some of the future investments as well, they're Brian and going out into next year and even beyond, what are the investments that you would like to see the company get right the first time in order to build a logistical network and a system that can really see its margins excel over the future. So it's a great question, Brad. The digital investments we're making, it's really shifting dynamic of UPS, old school package delivery. To now, it's more of an orchestrator of volume from end to end. We're putting investments into things like RFID technology so that every package in our system will have a code on it that we know where it is. And if there's nothing more frustrating for consumers or customers when they lose a package or they have an issue, they want to know where that package is by deploying this kind of technology, we're going to be able to tell people where are your packages and how can we recover and make sure we get them there on time for when the customers want them. And we do that at an incredible mid 90s percent in terms of on time delivery. Brian, I made this comment earlier in the show before you came on in. And I said, UPS is benefiting from, of course, having you as CFO, but also Carol too. Long time CFO, a home depot before she came to you. Am I off base there? Are you guys just looking at the quarter or your business differently than other big public companies? Brian, it's wonderful to have a boss who used to be a CFO because we have great conversations, but Carol's done an amazing job shifting the culture. So as we think about the future of UPS, yesterday's UPS is not going to get us tomorrow to where we want to be. We're 115 year old company, very proud of our past, but Carol is shifting the company to a place called Better and Boulder. The Boulder is growth and margin improvement. And so where is that going to come from? Areas of basically leaning into the most attractive parts of the market. I mentioned SMB. Margians are great. It's a very attractive area. Healthcare. That's a high growth, high margin area. International. We're actually number two and three and a number of markets overseas. So we're focused on stealing revenue share, value share as we call it, and going out there. So we're putting our investments in those areas that will be accreted from an investment perspective. UPS, CFO, Brian Newman. Thanks so much for joining us here this morning and breaking down the most recent quarter. Appreciate it. Thanks, Brian. Brian Brad, thank you. You got it. And everyone switching gears here, let's take a look at some of the market activity that we've been tracking here. Out of the gate this morning, the Dow Jones industrial average, at least about 38 minutes into trading, holding on to gains. And this after what was weaker than expected, consumer confidence reading from the conference board here this morning. But as of right now, the Dow Jones industrial average still up by about 110 points. Also, you've got the NASDAQ composite. That's higher by about 1.4%. And the S&P 500, you're seeing that hold on to gains to tune about 8% to 10% here. Also checking in on some of the other activity that we're seeing here on the day. We saw some electric vehicle, well, categories as electric vehicle earnings that have come out. But GM, really talking about their market share within this most recent quarter, shares are holding on to gains of about 2.4% that electric vehicle market share, reaching about 8%. They said in this most recent report, we're also going to get results out from Ford. And that's going to be coming later on this week as well. And so as of right now, holding on to gains of about 1.4% there for Ford 2. All right, thanks, Brad.

From Jeffery's analyst, Brent Phil says, they'll, while Meta's stock appears sheet, we believe investors need four key levers to drive the stock higher.

4072," It's a possible acceleration in the fourth quarter, two, flat or even declining year-of-year expense growth, three, increased focus on the core business away from the metaverse, and four, the re-acceleration of share it repurchases, indeed, a tall order for meta on its earnings reports. Check the label on that dry shampoo before you use it. This morning Brad is back with today's top headlines next. The What's the most important! This is the first time I have done this. I think I am a little bit more excited. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best. I am going to do my best.

Russia's Courts denied American basketball star Brittany Reiner's appeal today, upholding her nine-year prison sentence and drug charges for carrying two cannabis vape cartridges and her luggage Reiner is now expected to be moved to a penal colony, the denial of her appeal. I likely see hope for a release shift to the potential of a high profile prisoner swap. President Biden previously told CNN that he will only speak to Russia's Vladimir Putin at next month, G20 meeting, if it's to discuss Reiner's situation. Unilever is recalling popular brands of Airseller Dry shampoo, including Dove after discovering contamination with the cancer-causing chemical benzene. The recall also covers brands such as Nexus, Swab, Tresame and Tiki, which makes rock, a holic, and bed-head dry shampoo according to a notice posted on the Food and Drug Administration's website. The recall is the latest of half a dozen so far this year with the cancer-causing chemical showing up in products including deodorant, sanitizer, and sunscreen. And ultra is jewel labs as in talks with two of its biggest investors, director Nick Pritzker and Riasvilani, regarding a bailout deal to keep tobacco and that giant out of vacuropsy.

4073," And that giant out of bankruptcy. That's according to reports from the journal, the Hyatt Hotel Air and California Investor are considering putting up funds to cover jewels operations and near-term legal liabilities. The goal of a bailout would be to have jewel on stronger footing so it can pursue a dispute with federal regulators to keep its products in the US market. Though jewel has not finalized the deal and could decide not to pursue it at the end of the day. That's how it's done. SAP 500 NASDAQ are still in bear market territory. Meanwhile, several economic indicators, such as consumer sentiment manufacturing, continue to paint a gloomy picture for the US's economic outlook. But while Hawkeye Fed pulled the US into recession, and how is the business cycle playing out compared to previous recessions? SAP Global Rating's Chief Economist, Beth Ann, Bavino joins us now. Beth Ann always nice to get some time with you. This morning, we are waiting for a lot of earnings. You have Coca-Cola out here raising prices by 12%. We just talked to UPS and CFO saying, they don't really see any signs of per se a recession in their business looking for a good holiday season. Do you think we just avoid our recession? We have a baseline in our forecast for a recession. We think it's going to be a very shallow one. But a recession nonetheless is largely because of affordability issues, both because of still incredibly high prices, as you just noted, by the increase in final prices for US households, as well as affordability tied to interest rate hikes. So in both cases, we think the consumers will slow down dramatically, leading into a very shallow recession for early next year. Interesting. So with that in mind, where do you believe the mindset of the consumer would be by that point? Well, we're looking at the numbers from a consumer confidence a bit weaker than what we in market had expected. The idea is there that even that we expected a little bit not as extreme largely because we saw a bit of a pickup in the stock market, as well as pooling of gasoline prices. Well, that's not enough for consumers. They're still disappointed. And because it's not just about gasoline, it's about affordability and pretty much all aspects of society, particularly for shelter, not just who are purchasing a home, but also renting a home. And that means less money to spend elsewhere. People are squeezed and we do think they'll be fine with buckle. Bethan, I've really been surprised by how many, or how much price increases. A lot of these big companies have been reporting in recent weeks as they've come out with earnings. They continue to double-gint increases for products and services, really, for the second quarter in a row. When does it stop? When are we beyond these double-gint increases? Well, we're expecting to see eventually one of the reasons the good news about a recession, it also burns lower prices. And the big question of is, if consumers do slow down as we expect, that means there's going to be more inventory on businesses' books. So if we do it, do see a sleep, sleep, sleep, slow down for consumers, then we end up seeing as a lot of inventory used to be unloaded. And unfortunately, that inventory is unloaded at lower prices. So indeed, indeed, the fact gets us wish in the end. But of course, there's a cost to both businesses' consumers as well. We've got a lot of companies that have started reporting earnings fast and furious in this most recent quarter, but the forward guidance here is going to be the big question. What are your expectations for where companies will continue to either reiterate their guidance or, for some of them, we've already seen at least in the case of SNAP. No, a specific name, but where they might start to say, what we have to either pull back our guidance or just pull it in entirety. And what net impact would that have? Well, speaking from an economic position, again, I don't cover particular industries or companies. But I can say that given this environment, this is a classic over-heating situation for the United States, where the Fed has to come in and be incredibly aggressive. Understandably, we have core inflation still at a 40-year high on a year-over-year basis. So they have to move. And with that said, what I suspect we could see for those businesses that switched from just in time in inventory accumulation to just in case inventory of accumulation, that means that they're going to be squeezed. And so I suspect the forward guidance would be basically, what happens to profits when we have to unload all those inventories, that's where I suspect we could see some activity. Particularly for retail, the retail sector, who have been holding on to things, but I suppose other areas will be squeezed as well. Within your outlook, go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,54,2022-10-25 17:49:50
4074," inventory is that's where I suspect we can see some activity. Particularly for retail, the retail sector who have been holding on to things, but I suppose other areas will be squeezed as well. Within your outlook, Beth Ann, for a mild recession, is the economy shedding jobs? Are we talking about non-farm payroll reports where maybe there's 50,000 jobs should? In our business cycle barometer, the one indicator that is still showing positive, everything else is neutral or negative and extremely negative. But the one area that we're seeing still positive territories in that jobs market that you pointed to, we're looking at job openings coming down, slowing down, but still rather high. So the question is, are businesses canceling that job opening and still want to hold on to those workers? I suspect in certain areas that we're going to see the crunch. Retail, I mentioned housing. Also, I suspect we're going to see some kind of a cutting of jobs. But overall, we suspect a mild impact on jobs. And we do expect to see the unemployment rate rise, but we're looking at something that's going to be by 2024, about 5.5%. In normal times, that's what we used to get to. So indeed, we'll see a pickup, but nothing dramatically. Dramaticly so. Beth Ann, Bovino, S&P Global Ratings, US Chief of Commerce. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Big Arnie's reports from Microsoft in Google, Lark, our tech editor, Dan Halley is back with some analysis next. Early season rolls off at reports from Big Tech Giants, Microsoft and Alphabet, expected after the closing bell today. Y'all find it's tech editor Dan Halley, John, just now to preview what to expect. And Dan, it could be another interesting quarter for both of these companies. You have that strong dollar. You have growth slowing down. How do you see things? Dan Halley, we also have, you know, starting with Microsoft, obviously, their cloud business doing well. But then there's the drop in consumer spending on the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,55,2022-10-25 17:54:25
4075," Yeah, we also have, you know, starting with Microsoft, obviously their cloud business doing well, but then there's the drop in consumer spending on the personal computer front. So that could really sting Microsoft. Let's take a look at the numbers here. We have revenue estimates coming at 49.6 billion dollars. That's according to the streets consensus estimate and then EPS adjusted EPS we have that coming in at 229. We have the productivity and business processes revenue. That's 16.12 billion and then we have the intelligent cloud that's going to be at 20.31 billion. These are again all those estimates. And then the more personal computing at 13.09 billion that's a slight slight increase. So, you know, we're starting to see the effects on Microsoft's bottom line of this kind of pullback in consumer spending on those types of devices, not just because, you know, there's not enough on the market as there may have been during pandemic, but because so many people purchased during the pandemic, but there's no reason for them to go back out and buy computers again those usually last anywhere from three to five to seven years for some consumers. So there's really no reason for them to jump back out into the market and then you know on the Google front, we're looking at revenue X tack, which is traffic acquisition costs. That's at 58.18 billion or 58.2 billion and then we have EPS adjusted EPS estimated at $1.36. An advertising revenue is going to be the big issue here, whether or not they're stung similar to how we saw snap stung when it reported last week taking that huge one in their stock price after reporting those disappointing earnings. We're looking at potential revenue of 57 billion from advertising and then cloud services at 6.61 billion there still being kind of work through to try and improve those make it one of the larger offerings on the market still well behind Amazon and Microsoft, which are number one and number two. And then we also have the other bets at 204 million. We also had reports that Google was cutting back on some of its projects that may be visible in some of the earnings we'll have to see there. What be capex looks like so, obviously two important reports from two important companies, especially when it comes to both the cloud and the digital advertising markets. We also got meta up there on the screen too. They're expected to report you mentioned that you're going to be tracking across all of these companies where it does apply effects, cloud and ads. But what about the metaverse and the spending perhaps if I was to sum it up to that for all of these tech companies and how that should be in focus too. Yeah, I think for meta obviously the question is how much did it earn as far as ad revenue, how much has it been hurt as far as ad revenue and then how much is it continuing to spend on the metaverse project. We had Mark Zuckerberg talking it meta connect basically laying out what he sees as the future of the metaverse, how the company is going to kind of build that out and the different opportunities they're available focusing heavily on work environment, obviously Microsoft CEO, and the Dell had made an appearance for that and then on the gaming environment, but there has been calls obviously for there to be a reduction in spending on the metaverse. And there's been reports where the world that they're building just aren't exciting for customers and that the headsets they offer aren't something that people usually use as months after they purchased the one like gaming console or PC. So it'll be interesting to see what kind of the situation is like on meta as far as what the ad revenue is and then what that means as far as the metaverse goes and the spending there because they have been just plowing money into it and they're putting this as a long term goal, but for now it doesn't look like anybody's very much interested in it outside of a few use cases that may benefit the work environment, but for the average consumer, I don't think it's something that's really getting them going. Yeah, our finances Dan Howley, the tech DH, if you will here, Dan appreciate the time breaking down and teeing up some of these earnings reports set to come out, appreciate it. And switching gears here, everyone, cutting ties, Adidas has become the latest company to end its partnership with Ye formerly known as Kanye West following his anti-semitic remarks, the athletic brand says it will stop production of easy branded products immediately along with all payments to Ye and his companies. Bernstein, senior and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,56,2022-10-25 17:58:20
4076," Intimedic remarks, the athletic brand says it will stop production of easy branded products immediately along with all payments to Yeh and his companies. Bernstein, senior analyst, Anisha Sherman joins us now to discuss alongside Yahoo finances, Alexandra Canal. Anisha, great to have you here with us today. Help us really put this kind of into perspective on the business front, $250 million net income, short term negative impact, Adidas is saying that this is going to mean. What a time when the brand was already seeing some of that waning popularity within their core consumer groups. Yes, this is coming at a tough time for the company. They just have their second of two early earnings releases and guide downs for the year. They're now expecting Q4 to come in negative profitability anyway, you know, ex this easy impact and will this $250 million will further reduce the bottom line for Q4. The Q3 results have already been pre-released. The easy day, which was in August, counted towards Q3 performance and was quite successful. However, the launches that were slated for Q4, which were meant to come out in the kind of October and November timeframe have now been completely pulled and thus the impacts of the sales and the bottom line. And what's more important is Adidas is going to stop using the easy label altogether. Although the company does own the rights to the product, they're going to rebrand it as a latest product and stop using the easy brand label completely, which should take a haircut off the 2023 and beyond sales as well. Because that was quite a successful brand franchise for the company. And in Asia, there's no denying how successful the easy brand has been for Adidas, largely because it catered to Gen Z. It had that social currency with Yeh who at the time of the partnership in 2013, he was at the top of his game. So what other types of partnerships or alternative revenue streams should Adidas consider exploring in order to cater to that Gen Z consumer base? Yeah, that's a good question. So EZ has been one of their more successful franchises. But in recent years, they have tried to diversify that by adding a few additional franchises. We've seen them come out this year with launches with Gucci and with Prada. The Gucci collection in particular was very successful and they view it as a multi-year partnership. They're continuing their partnership with Stella McCartney, which is also a multi-year long-term partnership. It's also premium product, higher margin product, and they're continuing their work with Beyonce with the Adidas Part Collection, which also released a new line this year and will continue to be a multi-year partnership. So they do have several other partnerships. This isn't their only one, but that being said, Yeh Z has been, as you said, one of the more successful ones. So it will require a haircut to sales estimates as well as margins for the coming year or so. And, Michel, why do you think it took so long for Adidas to make this decision? Because I do think it says a lot about the corporate governance of a company like that. Yeah, I mean, this debate has been going on since August. So it started when actually Kanye West came out against Adidas alleging that they had stolen his intellectual property. Adidas insisted that they own all the IP of the Yeezy franchise that's been released today, that's for kind of normal terms of when, you know, these kinds of partnerships. But this debate has continued for the last two months. They were trying to make amends and trying to make things work. They had a few years left on the contract, but it's been under review for the last couple of weeks. They probably could have come to an agreement sooner. I don't know the details behind their legal disagreements, but essentially, I mean, it's a big part of their revenue and profit print. This franchise is one of them more successful. So I think they were trying to figure out a way to break things off, whether they would continue using the Yeezy name, whether they had the right to continue, how that would impact both this years and ongoing sales and how they would kind of position the brand going forward, which is why it took a few days longer. And there's been increasing pressure on the company to drop him, as we've seen other companies drop, um, drop him over the last couple of weeks, thanks to his all of his statements in the past few weeks. Relative to what's going on with Adidas at the moment and has Brad was saying, there's a lot of other issues at this company besides just yay. How do you view the competitive landscape? Yeah, it's, um, you know, it's a tough year for sportswear in general because China has continued to be a very slow market, both partly due to macro concerns as people have been held back by COVID restrictions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,57,2022-10-25 18:02:48
4077," It's a tough year for sports we're in general because China has continued to be a very slow market, both partly due to macro concerns as people have been held back by COVID restrictions, but also due to a continued prominence of local brands, of Chinese-owned brands, that have taken share from the big Western brands. So that's been a market that's continued to be tough, particularly for Adidas as they've kind of under invested in the region in the past and are now trying to make up for lost ground. At the same time, North America, as I'm sure you know, is going into a pretty heavy inventory quarter as your guest speaker was talking about a few minutes ago, and that's going to impact them as well. So we have the bearish China outlook, the kind of short-term bearish North American outlook, and then Amia. Amia is also under pressure. The consumer continues to pull back on discretionary spend. So it's been a tough year overall for the competitive landscape in general. It's been a tougher year for Adidas because they've had specific challenges in China to get their brand back on track. And so even preceding this easy announcement, they were expecting net income to drop below 500 million for the year, and that number is now even lower. Do you believe that there's a trickle through here to the resale market as well, considering what led to the termination of this deal? Do people now go on a stadium goods who's owned by Farfetch, a publicly traded company, and say, I don't want to buy easy shoes? Do they go on a stock ex and say, you know, I'm not any longer interested in buying this product? Yeah, I think that's a good question. I think if the product were continuing to be sold by Adidas, I would expect a general boycott of it. Now that the product is not going to be sold by Adidas, I think there might be a reversal of effect where this becomes, the easy product becomes somewhat of a collector's item, maybe not right now or nobody wants to touch it, but in over the next couple of years, it becomes a limited edition collector's item that's sold in resale. But I think the decision to stop branding the easy brand was a good decision for Adidas because at the moment that brand is associated very strongly with the creator, with the artist, and they want to cut the disassociate themselves completely. So I think what happens in the resale market is because of which restricted supply, it could continue to trade, but in the primary market, that was probably the right decision for that to do. And you show that the easy line has been popular almost since it hit the market. And because of that popularity, I think an argument could be made, it has taken market share from a company like Nike. But now if that brand is no longer going to be, Adidas is a Nike winner here. Yeah, I think they lose that portion of the market share, which was the, you know, the easy premium product. They are going to relaunch, they're going to continue to launch the designs. I mean, it's unclear where they're going to launch it as a sub brand or as just a kind of under the Adidas umbrella overall. They obviously aren't going to use the easy name anymore, but, you know, the sneaker heads and the loyal customers will know it's the same product as just being launched under the Adidas and brand umbrella. So I think they will retain some of those sales. They're not going to lose that entire kind of, you know, 1.5 to 2 billion worth of sales, but it will take a haircut because it's not, it's not being branded under that easy brand anymore. It will probably seed some share to some of the other sneaker head brands, including Nike. The real sneaker heads will always know Anisha Sherman. Thanks so much for joining us here on the morning Bernstein senior analyst, Anisha Sherman and Yahoo Finance's own Alli-Can-Now. Appreciate it. You guys coming up, turbulence guys. And expensive times for JetBlue shares of the company moving lower by about 6.5 percent after the company posted the profit and they were just pulled up. CEO, the CEO, excuse me, warning that every penny matter that's cost the sports fuel continues rise.

4078," будете Remove locksERE Ensure zas Use a residual tool and use it every 5 cocoff Welcome back everyone. Let's turn now to some market movers this morning. Let's start with JetBlue earnings, ticker symbol JBLU. Shares moving lower by a little more than 6%. This is after the airline company reported earnings for the third quarter, missing estimates on the bottom line while beating out revenue expectations here. A few things to really consider here, the fact that many of the airline operators are still getting back to full capacity compared to 2019. For JetBlue you've also got this near term deal and the finalization of that deal that is still very much just hanging in the balance waiting to be fully done and investors have had time to realize what that might mean to the balance sheets of JetBlue once that finally goes through. JetBlue in the near term though they are still being one of the beneficiaries of this northeastern alliance along with American Airlines too which really helped them during the summer travel season. But in the near term I believe that those fuel prices still being up, I think it was up 87% comparable to last year that's something that American Airlines had also cited in their most recent earnings. And just like we were talking about, excuse me earlier Brad, between the now emerging different investing stories between a UPS and FedEx, I would argue I put forth that same thesis on JetBlue. You talked to Delta CEO Ed Bastion, very good quarter American Airlines, very good quarter. What was United reported to? Already? Strong demand. Strong demand, very good quarter. A little bit of different tone from JetBlue and it makes you wonder are they going to get distracted or have they been distracted by trying to first solidify the spirit deal. And now, oh yeah, they're going to have to integrate it at some point if it gets approval. Yeah and that integration when you're thinking about updating an entire airline, everything from painting planes to try and get rid of that ugly yellow color all the way to making sure that you've just got a different aircraft that maybe doesn't feel like a canister in the sky. All of those things get taken into consideration. So updates of the fleets, also the integration of the teams and the operations. And it's also going to be a consideration around which actual flight gates that you're positioned at so that you can kind of condense what that operational space looks like at the hubs that you're working in and out of as well. They're all in on the anti yellow. They're in all yellow. 100%. You're in. All right. Chairs of Tesla, they're up after surprisingly bearers take from Morgan Stanley, the bank cutting, it's price target to $3 and $3 down from $350, sending a highly volatile economic environment and anticipating unexpected headwinds.

4079," It's price target to $3.3 down from $350, sending a highly volatile economic environment and anticipating unexpected headwinds. And of course, this call comes from our friend of the show Adam Jonas over at Morgan Stanley. He's a market mover on Tesla. He's still staying bullish, of course, on Tesla. He's been a longtime bull in this company. But really noting for what he, making, he's saying, quote, making room for unexpected, unexpected headwinds in the current economic environment or argue, Brad, some of those unexpected headwinds are coming out of China. When we talked about China was yesterday, Tesla cunning prices in that China market, that is a complete new term from what Tesla had been experiencing last year and even the first part of this year. Right. And for Tesla, they have to acknowledge what's happening in the region too. It sounded like when they were on the call that they didn't want to really discuss what is really taking place within that region in China. And you have so much competition that is being brought online that much quicker, that is improving their capacity for production, improving their relations with customers in the region too, who have the propensity to buy some of the electric vehicles, either on the mass market side or on the more expensive side. And the propensity right now is leaning towards some of the homegrown brands in the region too. Tesla doesn't want to acknowledge that, of course, they want to continue to focus on their products. But I think it still is a realization that has to be factored in to what their forecasts are actually looking like in the region too. Right. And on this too, yesterday I mentioned that X-Pung is really going toe to toe with Tesla and China. And I got raked over the calls on Twitter for it. I do think folks, even the Tesla bulls, pull up some of the specs on these X-Pung vehicles. They are very impressive. That technology package in that car is very, very impressive indeed. So, let's say on all things in dust show, UPS had a good quarter as CFO Brian Newman explained to us just moments ago that is just not to buy over at rival FedEx.

From a couple years, how does it look, where does old temples run? Welcome back everyone. This is time for Cretan Time. We've got three stories. One minute each. We start with this today. Warner Brothers says the cost of its scrapped shows and sitcoms it could total $2.5 billion. This is as it restructures itself financially. Now, the thing to remember for so many of the production houses as they have been shifting into streaming, there's a ton more data that they're being able to leverage to really determine whether or not a show even before it goes to production is going to be successful, which makes it even more alarming perhaps that there's a $2.5 billion hit that you could see when you are having that massive shift towards a streaming platform, launching that streaming service, and then actually forecasting what will perform well in that environment too. Yeah, look, there's just a, it continues to be a rapid changes in the environment, how content is consumed, of course led by the streaming movement. And I just think a lot of these companies, media, legacy media companies are realizing there's still a lot of bloat inside of them.

You have one person that reports to another person and they all report to one other person. There's just too many people in there given this changing dynamic. So again, I think you probably see more layoffs or more changes like this. And is there a change in the binging trends as well? Is the business of binge is that kind of the thing in the past now? Now we're all binge. We're still watching. We're still binge. Yeah, I'm definitely binge. All right, Mattel, catching the best Pokemon of their all. Pokemon of them all, the Toymaker securing a franchise deal to make Pokemon toys under license. This is, I would say, yet another big win for Mattel and CEO and on cries. They are going to report earnings to Nights. This has just been, you know, in addition to the revival of the Barbie brand. This is just another feather in the hat of a non in that team over there. This is just, I mean, it's a home run deal. Essentially, just really stealing it off from other nose of house, bro. This is massive. You've got an international brand. It has had so much success across gaming and some of the digital spaces as well has had a successful entertainment side of the business that directly dovetails into how many people want to buy the toys over time. And I was one of those kids grown up. I had these toys. That was your generation. That and power. We had the Poke Balls. Power Rangers. Yes. They had one of the most virally successful AR apps and game experiences. You remember back in 2015, 2016, people would just stop in the middle of the street. On people's lawns trying to catch a virtual Pokemon. There you go. My generation, it was Bugs Bunny, you know, mid-80s, late 80s, Bugs Bunny on Saturday morning. It was Space Star. Well, no AR.

If you go online, you can see it's usually a stripe, heart and shoulder, all mixed together. I'm just reporting what's out there. Look, I mean, it is kind of tasty sometimes. The Mick Heart. It's all on a Mick Heart lunch. Give me a Mick Heart. No. Well, thank goodness for the farewell tour of the Mick Rib. We hope it's well received. Perhaps among those who celebrate Mick Ribs out there in the world. Maybe with the Mick Calorie. Five or twenty calories here for the Mick Rib. Definitely not died, friendly. All right. We've been talking about earnings all morning long. Brad, let's give everyone our quick takeaways for me. It's definitely, it's pricing. Yeah. It's a UPS. It's a Coca-Cola. The calling out that they continue to successfully raise prices. Sure, a lot of these companies have seen volume hits, but still, I am just amazed by these double-digit price increase. A lot of these companies are calling out. It makes you wonder when is inflation going to come down back to the Fed's target range? You would think maybe sometime later in 2023, but, you know, corporate America continues to push through big prices increases. And I forgot to mention, sure, and Williams too, as well, pushing through big price increases. You know, mine is more of actually a preview here, especially as we've been talking about tech all day from our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders to kick off the show all the way through what the expectations might be, considering some of the pressures that we're seeing on advertising, the pressures that we're seeing on price as well. Their consumers are taking price where that demand is still holding up within consumer technology. And then even more, all of these companies are going to have to account for, as they've already reported in last quarter, the FX headwind that is going to be persistent. And that's not going anywhere anytime soon until you see a weakening of the dollar. And so with all of that in mind, I think that really tees up what we could see within tech in the persistent headwinds, especially in FX, but also just where that continues to compress on some of their margins as well. Yeah, I'm just looking at the three major intercies right now, Brad, reacting favorably to what has been buying large, a pretty good earning season now. A lot of blowups out there, of course, you had Snap, etc. But the market seems to be embracing some of these better than expected earning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,62,2022-10-25 18:27:20
4082," Favorably, to what has been buying large, a pretty good earnings season now, a lot of blowups out there, of course, you had snap, et cetera. But the market seems to be embracing some of these better than expected earnings. The markets just look in for some relief wherever we can find right now. Sure, over these past four or five sessions, we've looked pretty good, but think about what was taking place coming into the expats four or five sessions, precipitous declines, and it's going to be a question of, as we move on throughout the rest of this earnings season, where investors at least get an inkling of positivity from the equity market. Well, if you need some stomach relief, don't order that McMurray we were just talking about. Coming up, you'll find Ciccafajita has you for the next hour of trading. She will be joined by former speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Chad is the latest SPAC venture. They're moving midterm elections and all things DC that's an interview. You do not want to miss. We'll be right back. Welcome to Yakut Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Makiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Stocks getting a tailwind as GM, UPS, and Coca-Cola all beat the street. The Nasdaq pushing higher ahead of big results from Alphabet and Microsoft. So to the moon, we're going to ask DeFull about the $4,300 call on 4,300 college to say on the S&P.

4083," doesn't condone any form of hate speech. It sees a short-term negative impact on finances, but is there a bigger fallout to come? We've got a panel standing by to discuss. And return of the SPAC former House Speaker Paul Ryan backs his company all the way to the New York Stock Exchange listening. Listing will ask him about market choppiness and how he feels two weeks ahead of his all-important midterms. First though, let's check in on the market action right now. We are seeing green across the board. As we look at all three major indices right now, 90 minutes into the trading day, the Dow up about 175 points right now, the S&P 500 up 36 and the NASDAQ up 157. As always, or I should say, especially this week, the NASDAQ, the big one to watch with Microsoft and Alphabet on tap today after the bell. But we are kicking off this hour with general motors. Out with better than expected earning today, and we are seeing that reflected in the shares up more than 3% as the auto manufacturer reaffirms its full year outlook despite a challenging environment. GM reporting a record third quarter revenue of $41.9 billion, driving $3.3 billion of net income attributable to stockholders for a closer look at GM and the auto space. Let's turn to our very own prize, a supermanian. Pros, it does feel like they've kind of turned the corner in terms of those big headwinds they've been facing, whether it is the supply shortage inventory, not quite up to where they want it to be, but it is headed in the right direction. Yeah, for sure. They had a record quarter revenue just barely below analyst expectations. Big profit here, $4.3 billion in adjusted net income that's almost 50% higher than a year ago. Like you said, they were able to hit these sort of numbers. The man is strong, supply constraints easing. You saw that they reaffirmed their EBIT guidance for the year, which a lot of people thought they would maybe take that down because of the fact that maybe things are slowing down, maybe there's some issues with supply and pricing. But Mary Barra in her letter said that, they reaffirmed the guidance despite a challenging environment because demand continues to be strong for GM products and we're actively managing headwinds that we face. Also talking about how they captured 8% of the EV market share with the bolt and bolt EV doing really well. They're an increase in production of that car. And they're on track for their EV game plan. They're going to release the Equinox, the Blazer, the Silverado next year. And they again maintain that they acquired materials enough materials for 1 million EV run rate in 2025. So a lot of good things here in this quarter for GM. Ford, obviously the next one on tap to report their results. Is there anything we can take away from what GM reported today in terms of where things are headed in the car space, particularly on EVs? Well, it sounds like demand isn't an issue, at least for US automakers. And I think Ford will price the same thing potentially tomorrow. Big question is, are they going to also reaffirm their guidance? We're not as lucky as sure. They're sort of hinting at their having issues with headwinds like the pricing pressures they're facing. So could that take down their guidance or for profit guidance? We'll see. But it sounds like demand is not a concern. Despite the fact that we have so many the negative drumbeat of is the global macroeconomic, economy, kind of withering, is pricing coming down. I think what we're seeing is that it's not affecting demand for cars, at least. Yeah, we've heard sort of the question, I guess the verdict is still out, whether in fact we're at that tipping point with EVs gas prices creeping back up again. So we'll continue to watch the demand there. Thanks so much for that. Well, let's take a look now at more big name earnings, starting with Coca-Cola, the beverage giant, topping estimates in its latest quarter, as well as raising its revenue outlook for 2022, though unable to avoid the currency headwinds weighing on others. Shares up just slightly there. Joining me now is Yahoo Finance, is Brian Sasi, itching to get into all those numbers? Where do we start? I think I start on pricing. It's been the theme of the morning. It's not just with a Coca-Cola. It's a UPSU name, but anyway, with Coca-Cola pricing up 12% in that third quarter, also Coke Zero. Coke Zero, up 11% in terms of sales. It's been, I think it was a blowout quarter for a Coca-Cola. A little bit of a squishy guidance outlook from the company, but still very much mirrored what we heard from Pepsi-Cola last week. Strong pricing, strong demand, consumers not really blocking at these price increases. And I think the next big thing for Coca-Cola is this really next wave of innovation. More new flavors for Coke Zero. More new flavors for Costa Coffee. That's a brand they bought. I believe two and a half years ago, I think the company is really winning high marks on the street after a quarter like this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,64,2022-10-25 18:36:00
4084," More new flavors for Costa coffee. That's a brand they bought. I believe two and a half years ago, I think the company's really winning high marks on the street after a quarter like this. UPS, another name that you're watching really closely. There are FX headwinds get again being mentioned like so many earnings calls. Really make me work today. But yes, UPS, good quarter for UPS, strikingly different compared to what we heard from FedEx, which later real egg in terms of this earnings two and a half weeks ago. But look with CFO Brian Newman told us about FX challenges on its business in the third quarter. The currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business. But we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. And right up there with pricing, Kiko, it is the currency headwind, of course, impacting UPS, but also heard Coca-Cola by 8% in terms of their sales in the most recent quarter. And we talked to Beth Ann Bovino in the prior hour and the 10 o'clock hour. And these currency headwinds are likely to be around for some time. They're not going away in the fourth quarter. They might stick around into the first half in next year and likely continue to weigh themselves. Yeah, and something that we're tracking every day in terms of dollar strength. All right, we got you on set. We're going to keep working you, Brian. All right, G.E. Let's do it. Let's go. G and 3M. All right, well G.E.E. later, another dud. And I'm surprised the stock is not completely falling off a cliff here. One of the hottest tickers in the aisle, funnets, a platform here this morning that is G.E.E.N.3M. I'll start with G.E. They actually warned on their full year. And I think you could really tie to two things. First, the renewable energy segment was, again, a dreadful quarter. Order is down 43%. Operate at a loss on an adjusted operating profit base. Not a good quarter for them. And I do think this is a management team severely distracted by trying to split up its company into three businesses. G.E.Healthcare will be the first one out of the shoot as a public company in early January. And then 3M, like G.E.E. lowering its full year outlook. And again, another one, just not some, I'm really surprised not seeing a stronger negative market reaction when you see a 3M warn warn about currency, concerned about higher inflation and supply chain. But again, two industrial giants right now, hot tickers on our platform, both warning for the full year, not a great, I would say, read on the global economy. Yeah, you're right. Not as big of a reaction with 3M down about 6.10. You want to do it anymore? Any more? You got it? Good. I can keep going. You have to write like five stories, right? OK. Fair enough. All right. Go to YahooFinance.com. How about that? We'll pitch all your stories. All right, friends, how's it? Thanks so much for that. And let's move on to our trending ticker. Turbulence for JetBlue shares in the airline carrier under heavy pressure after the company missed analyst estimates on its latest results. The company earned 21 cents a share on revenue of $2.5 billion. Revenue per available seat mile, which is a key metric we track. Increased by more than 23%, it's strong travel demand and higher ticket prices help offset those higher costs. Still though, JetBlue expects some of that demand to soften in the current quarter, but the president's chief operating officer saying he expects capacity to be up just one to 4% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Well, coming up, Yeezy doesn't. Adidas parts ways with the artist formerly known as Kanye West after a string of controversies. Could the battle over his namesake grant end up in court? We've got a lot to discuss on this headline here. That's coming up on the other side.utes next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,65,2022-10-25 18:40:44
4085," LOL We'll talk about that in a little bit. Well, stocks currently looking positive across all three major indices right now with a Dow up for the 200 points is a relief rally on the horizon. Our next guest thinks so and says the S&P could make it could make its way back to 4,300 by April. That is barring outside factors joining us now is Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Seifold. Barry, we could all use some positive news after the last month that we've had. Certainly we have seen gains pick up over the last few weeks on this expectation potentially of a Fed pivot. What are you watching right now in terms of levels that that will really you think could push things in the right direction? Well, you know a lot of the bad news was known and we had a violent sell-off in the first 10 months of this year. You know, if you look at the nominal peak of the S&P 500 index, it was 4,800 on January 3rd, but the real inflation adjusted purchasing power peak was 5,100 on December 29th. So we fell about 31.5% which if you look at the 14 bear markets since 1947 in the post-World War 2 era really the 14 bear markets associated with recessions, the average and what we call the trim mean taking out the highest in the lowest was 31.7%. So we had a bear market, ambitious malling bear market due to Fed policy. But when we analyze all the fixed income currency, futures, political, economic, geopolitical factors, you know we come up with the view that if the Fed is not turning the dial to tighten every single day, that's effectively a second derivative easing. In other words, not raising the volume is a form of lowering the volume. And I don't think the Fed gets tighter than what's embodied in futures. In fact, I think futures are probably overstated in May of 2023 at nearly 5% on short rates. Inflation is going to come down. Any first year economic student in college could do what we did. All you do is break down inflation into its sub components. And all of them point down. All of them. So Barry, does that mean that you're in the camp that you think the Fed could potentially pause some of these rate hikes because you think that inflation is starting to show some signs of moderating and that the Fed can't move to aggressively. Well, we look at GDP right on a quarterly annualized. So we take the most recent quarter. We annualize it, multiply it to the fourth power. We annualize GDP. And we have a new fund for the third generation of inflation. So CPI inflation for the three months ended September. Analyzed was only 2%. Yes, it's 2%. So the momentum of inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,66,2022-10-25 18:44:58
4086," lies inflation. So CPI inflation for the three months ended September, annualized was only 2%. Yes, it's 2%. So the momentum of inflation has already turned down. If you take the core, it consists of services and that is shelter services, so that would be housing related. Those are already turning down. Yes, there's a lag, but they are turning down decisively on rents, home prices you saw the day that today. You look at non-shelter services, wages are the key driver, and wages such as the Atlanta Fed, wage tracker, and average hourly earnings year to year change. And hopefully, on the 28th, the employment cost index all points down. So again, you know, you have to steer the ship with a long lead time, the Fed knows that, and they've done their job. They flatten the curve by end of year, the curve will be completely flat, if not inverted in some points, obviously, tenditudes. But as they do that, we have to be ahead of that. We have to think, okay, well, the Treasury is worried about bond market liquidity. Treasury Secretary Yellen, former chair Yellen of the Fed made a statement yesterday. The Treasury is intently focused on bond market risk due to liquidity and other concerns. So if the market is always ahead of reality, we have to get ahead of that. And so it looks to us like there'll be a rally October to April. I wouldn't overstate the rally. There are a lot of tail risks later in 23. But again, the market is always looking ahead. And we're trying to keep up with it. And I admit it's a really hard job. So Barry, you mentioned some key risks there that could derail that upwards climb to 4,300. One of them being oil shocks. What's the big concern there right now? The G7 and the West collectively are desperately trying to establish what's called a buyer's cartel on Russian oil. And naturally, and you can't blame them, OPEC Plus, which is OPEC's many member states, plus Russia. They don't want with their sellers cartel to have a competing buyer's cartel. So they're not cooperating. And they shouldn't cooperate. That would just be a logical to expect them to do so. So the early December, there is this planned cap on Russian oil. That could create tremendous volatility. Russia has a lot of avenues. I personally would be thinking they might target the CPC pipeline out of Kazakhstan to reduce flows without cutting their own production to drive the price up. And if oil rockets higher, oil is at the core of inflation. This is what the ESG people never understood. That all energy is, all GDP is the conversion of energy. And because of some of the dragging risks on GDP growth, demographics, debt, we don't have the kind of growth we used to have. And as a consequence, we need cheap energy. And so more expensive energy is not going to solve this problem. So if energy goes up, that's the core of inflation. That drives everything, including core CPI and core PCE. So we don't need an oil shock. And that's the risk here. You know, I remember the 1970s very well. We had a 73, 74 oil embargo. And then in 79, we had a second oil shock due to the shower of Iran falling in Iran. We don't need that. And so geopolitically, I think we've got some very poor diplomatic policy out of Washington. And hopefully they don't drive us over the edge with a secondary oil shock, having already depleted these strategic petroleum reserves. Steve, well, chief equity strategist Barry Bannister, it's good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Well, partnership over. Adidas is ending its massive deal with yay. Artist formerly known as Kanye West. Following a series of anti-Semitic remarks, the shoemaker, the latest high profile brand to cut ties with the artist saying it will stop production of Yeezy branded products immediately, as well as all payments to Yee and his companies. Joining us to discuss the implications we've got Brad Smith as well as Alexis Keenan and Brad, let's start with you because we are trying to figure out what the financial hit is likely to be. I mean, we talk about Yeezy. I mean, Kanye produced products of what been driving 8 to 10 percent of the revenue. Yeah, for Adidas, they're saying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,67,2022-10-25 18:48:51
4087," But the financial hit is likely to be. I mean, we talked about Yeezy. I mean, Kanye produced products of what been driving 8% to 10% of the revenue. Yeah, for Adidas, they're saying near term, this could be upwards of $250 million to their net income. But you also think about some of the tertiary dollars as well. We were discussing just last hour with Bernstein, analyst, Anisha Sherman, and the resale community as well. This could also take a hit in the near term. You think about companies like Stadium Goods, owned by a company Farfetch, publicly traded FTCH, I believe. And with all of that in mind, and how so many of those companies have looked across the product lines that have been the most hype beast ex. Yeezy has been squarely within the fold, same to the success of almost mirroring the success of how well Nike dunks have done. And so for a brand that has largely fallen out of favor and seen waning favor over a core consumer constituent in millennials and Gen Z recently losing or having this type of instance that hits on the brand in concert with what's already taking place with the deterioration of the brand could have a much longer term impact as well. There's been a lot of criticism about how long Adidas took to make this decision. I wonder if we have any idea about the financial hit they did take, or they're likely to take, not necessarily of the resale side that you're talking about. But how many consumers said, look, I'm just not going to buy this based on his remarks. Well, his remarks, let's just lay it out on the table. It was antisemitic. He had even prior to that going on rants and wore t-shirts that were saying white lives matter and kind of throwing especially within the black community where black lives matter. Throwing that on its head almost. And so for a consumer group that you have cozyed up to for so many years to now go and do the exact opposite and what I was saying within our show this morning is he is now kind of shifted his entire brand in this era of influencer economy and said, I'm going to pander into such a different direction that is hurtful to so many consumers out there and the population more broadly that now if you're going to continue that pander you also have to be comfortable with knowing that brands are going to step away. It's Adidas. It is JP Morgan. It is a company in CAA, the creative artist agency. And there you're seeing on the screen Gap, which he had had the music partnership with Balenciaga. And so this is far more ranging than just the financial hit of Adidas. It's all of those other companies as well that are going to see some type of impact in the near future. And Alexis, I know you've been looking at sort of the legal side of things. You know, who actually owns the rights to reproduce some of the things that Kanye just designed. I mean, where does that stand right now? Because it was just what last week a few of you saw where he heard Kanye coming out and saying, look, they can't drop me. And also demanding and posting on social media, expecting a $2 billion payout to terminate this deal. But look, I think we first need to put an umbrella on the situation to say, this is somebody who has outwardly expressed that they have mental illness since 2018. So these companies that are contracting with him as the sole owner of some of these brands, Yeezy in particular, they are contracting with a company whose chief is known to have expressed that he has bipolar. So there's some knowingness going into this. But look, that statement that you read going into the segment here with Adidas saying that after this review, they've decided to end production of the Yeezy branded products, not necessarily the sale of them right now. It doesn't sound exactly like they're committing to that. But also saying that they'll stop all payments to Yeezy and his companies. It kind of isn't a full blanket statement that they're ending it there, at least the way I read it. Now, these contracts, in this case, is a private contract. So we don't know what it says between Adidas and his company. But typically, they're licensing agreements where Yee is creating the designs. And then Adidas would own 100% of those designs. So all of the designs that would have been made under that contract, they would typically belong to Adidas. But I'll just caveat it and say, we haven't seen those actual words on that paper. We're not sure. These licenses, they can change hands. They can be sold. They can be assigned as well. Yeah, I mean, to your point about what he has said publicly about having bipolar, I mean, the whole conversation, I will say, just on a personal level, is just a little uncomfortable to watch. We're not a f*****.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,68,2022-10-25 18:53:19
4088," Yeah, I mean, you know, to your point about what he has said publicly about having bipolar. I mean, the whole conversation I will say just on a personal level is just a little uncomfortable. The one. I mean, not only the anti-Semitic comments that he's made, but you have seen a lot of these companies to your point sort of understanding the situation but going into an agreement, you know, knowing that there are still risks on the side and I wonder, you know, bad or lexas, both of you can weigh in on this. So, what is, you know, where does his brand go? His personal brand go beyond this. You could argue, you know, he moves away from the public eye, he gets some help. Who knows what's going to transpire, but compared to what we have seen in the past, I mean, this feels like the damage is really great. Yeah, and this is where it's a, if I may, the separation of a musician who has built up their brand on who they had been as a musician to what that actual brand has become as a result of the partnerships that move forward and the millions, billions of dollars that were thrown around to make his brand even more appetizing to a range of consumers, whether that be a range of consumers in apparel and fashion or whether that be in some of the other technological landscapes that he wants to operate in. This is still a person that's trying to buy parlor too. So his brand is clearly going in that direction right now with the commentary hurtful as it is has been. And so he is fully delving his brand, fuller into that and even more full steam ahead into some of the hateful commentary that has been known to persist on a platform like that technologically. Well, and it runs counter, right, to the exact fan base that he builds. So, it's run counter to some of his own lyrics. Yeah. Well, I mean, you're exactly right. When you go back and listen to some of his early albums, this is exactly what he reeled against and now he's become a part of that. So, a story that really to your point sort of covers not just the music industry, the fashion industry. It has wide range of implications, but I know both continue to watch it. Coming up, return of the SPAC for my house speaker Paul Ryan, bringing the bell as energy group, Brandon Ridge, lists on the New York Stock Exchange today.

Let's get you up to speed on some of the buying that we're seeing play out in the broader market. You can see all three of the major averages holding on to gains as we enter the final hour of trading assistance right now. Dow up 264 points. You'll get the Nasdaq up nearly 2% Nasdaq leading the gains today. I'm not saying that that's one of the first and three points that are still in the market. There's more than 1,000 that's also in the green today. Up just around a 2.6%. Now there's risk on sentiment that we're seeing play out in the equities. We want to take a look at the bond market because yield pulling back for the second day in Iraq. You see the 10-year note. Up just around 13 basis points back at 4.11.30 on deck after the bell this afternoon will be hearing from alphabet and Microsoft those two names in the green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,70,2022-10-25 19:02:26
4090," 26 taking look at some of the gains that we're seeing more specifically. Let's start with the Nasdaq because we have a couple of big tech earnings on deck after the bell this afternoon. We'll be hearing from Alphabet and Microsoft those two names in the green ahead of those results. Google up just over 1% will hear from Apple and Amazon later this week as well as Meta. You can see Meta up nearly 6% today. Taking a look at the sector action here all I guess 10 of the 11 sectors in the green today energy is the outlier that's off just around 6 10s of a percent. Let's take a look at some of this risk on action. You see that playing out in a number of the meme stocks you have game stop up nearly 10% to your AMC up another 6.5% bedbath and beyond soaring today as well. You can also see the buying playing out in the crypto market Bitcoin back above 20,000 for the first time since October 7th. We're also seeing ether up another 11% this afternoon. Dave crypto, meme stocks. Winning today makes a lot of sense. Thank you, Shadda. Let's catch up speed now on housing. The latest numbers very much in the eye of the beholder category home price growth cooled at a record pace but again it's still growth. Price is up 13% in August from the year prior that's according to today's case Schiller index. A much smaller jump in the 15.6% growth in July and 18% jump in June. Nonetheless the drop between July and August was the largest since at least 1987 when they began tracking that data. The biggest increases Miami and Tampa, Florida both up 28 plus percent and Charlotte, North Carolina up 21% price growth as you might imagine by those numbers strongest in the southeast. The chicken with Jared Blickery now gets up to speed on some earlier earnings. Jared? Yes well let's take a look at the general market here. We have the S&P 500 up over 1%. I believe this is going to make three days in a row as doing a little study earlier today and that poor 10 some strength. However if you bought those two signals earlier in the year would not have worked out three six months down the line. However historically going back there is something to this. I'll get into that towards the close of the bell. Just wanted to point everybody's attention to the Yahoo Finance Trending Takers and Shana you were taking a look at the meme stocks and also some of the other fringe elements to the stock universe. I want to go over some earnings and do it democratically but I got to scroll down for general motors here. People focused on a lot of things here today. So first of all the stocks up about three four percent here and I want to focus on some of the analyst commentary. RBC which rates it in outperforms saying after the Ford pre-announced with that was negative and some GM volume data some investors were concerned about a miss. 2022 guidance reaffirmed but this leaves a pretty wide range for implied fourth quarter levels. Midpoint of the implied fourth quarter EPS below the street but full your street view is closer to the low end of 675 versus 650 to 750 would not be surprised to see fourth quarter numbers creep a little higher. Let me just take a quick look at the stock here. You can see that's today's performance. Here is a year to date and you can see after basing for several months we are now testing those lows as our number of stocks but importantly hasn't exceeded those as a number of the indices have. Now scrolling down here one to get to at least one more earnings that alphabet is after the bell and so we're going to take a look at Coca-Cola. Here we go. That is up two and a half percent today. You can see racing off of those recent lows and I do have some commentary by the street. Here we go. Wells Fargo, Chris Carrey showing third quarter showed that KO's momentum has sustained as we approached 2023 and the initial currency outlook for next year is less bad than feared getting down to those currency feared stronger dollar. Not a concern today but overall it has been guys. All right, Jared. Thanks so much for bringing that down. Let's talk a little bit more about the buying action that we're seeing play out in today's market. For that we want to bring in Brent, a shooting, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management's Chief Investment Officer Brent. It's great to see you again. So we're looking at stocks trading higher for the third day in a row. Nasdaq leading the way today up nearly two percent. What do you make of the buying action? And I guess do you think the gains that we've seen recently do they have staying power? I do and certainly the markets kind of gone back and forth and I expected to remain volatile but the big component of today was the sticky inflation narrative continues to fall by the wayside. And so I know that backwards inflation numbers still look elevated but housing was brought up early.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,71,2022-10-25 19:06:19
4091," was the sticky inflation narrative continues to fall by the wayside. And so I know that backwards inflation numbers still look elevated. But housing was brought up earlier in the segment. The housing market is important because the quote sticky inflation right now is in the services side of the economy. Housing and rents make up 32% of the 56% of the sticky inflation in services. Housing market is weakening. That housing market weakening, that rent market weakening, shows up with a 12 month lag in the CPI number. And as you saw today, housing prices aren't going up, they're going down. As are rents. And so if you think about that in the future, sticky inflation will be coming down because that housing market data, which is now faltering, that rent data, which is now faltering in current rents, that will begin showing up in the inflation number. And that will combine with goods prices, which are also falling, and commodity prices, which many people aren't talking about. But commodity prices are flat on a year of your basis. And so I guess to kind of tie it all together, you are seeing inflation, forward looking inflation measures coming down. That has stabilized the bond market. And when you stabilize the bond market, you stabilize the stock market. And that is why you are seeing upward pressure on both stocks and bond prices today. Leading you, Brent, to believe the Fed is going to do what? When? I think they probably tighten 75 basis points by next week they take it. They want to get to a place where they believe monetary policy is tight before job loss is started croering. So if you think about that, they didn't want to be tightening at the same time the job market is weakening. One other data point that came out today is that the jobs market, which is believed to be tight, we've noted this bit in the past. In the conference ford, there is a question to questions. Are jobs easy to get or are they hard to get? This has an incredible, the diffusion between these two, has an incredible correlation with the unemployment rate. That fell again today. We're 15 points off the high. If I look back in prior cycles when this happens, you start seeing the unemployment rate rise and actually start seeing negative jobs reports. And so believe it or not in today's environment, that is actually a positive because it shows that some of these forces that have led inflation higher are starting to abate, which has been the market's big problem and the Fed's big problem. And that means the Fed will eventually be able to stop. We'll hopefully after they do 75 basis points this time. So, Brent, you don't think they're going to raise rates in in December? I think they would say they're dependent. If we've learned anything, they're incredibly reactionary. Keep in mind at the beginning of the year, the Federal Reserve thought they'd raised rates by 0.875% this year. And the quote-unquote outlier on the dot plot was 1.1%. This is why the market's been so volatile is because the Fed has been chasing this and been wrong for some time. Hopefully they are able to stop. Hopefully they're able to see the inflation number coming down. They want to see that first before they stop tightening so that you don't believe they're not on the job. But hopefully we'll start seeing that in the coming months data. Despite all that, recessionary fears remain high. And Bank CEO after CEO is added to that suspicion. And then Jamie Dimitz did something interesting. Davos in the desert in Saudi Arabia. Let's listen to that and get your reaction. But there's a lot of stuff in the horizon, which is bad. And could, it doesn't necessarily, but could put the United States in a recession. That's not the most important thing for what we think about. We'll manage right through that. I would worry much more about the geopolitics of the world today. I think the most important thing is the geopolitics is going in Russia, Ukraine, America, China, you know, the relationships of the Western world. And that would have to be far more concerned than whether it's a milder, slightly severe recession. Always interesting comments from Jamie, your reaction, Brent. Well, I said a few comments lately about economic storms and hurricanes and whatever else it may be. So he's been kind of all over this place. Look, I've said it for a while. I'll say it again, we are going to have a mild recession, at least I believe so. We have never seen leading economic indicators where they're at today and not been in a recession or had a recession. I don't think that's necessarily so important because I don't think inflation survives a recession. And I do believe the recession would be mild because overall, despite the narrative, the consumer remains in great shape. And so what I'm hopeful for is that we have this pullback. We've free up a little labor market slack, the Fed stops, and then we're able to come on the other side of this with inflation falling and we kind of return to a normal environment. Geopolitics are definitely a cause for concern. We own gold because of that. And so I'm suggesting that maybe you should think about hedging a little bit of your portfolio, but please don't overdo it because I don't know for certain notice anybody what happens with run.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,72,2022-10-25 19:10:42
4092," We own gold because of that. And so I'm suggesting that maybe you should think about hedging a little bit of your portfolio, but please don't overdo it because I don't know for certain in order to see anybody what happens with Russia and Ukraine. So, interesting. You're allocating some of your portfolio at least to gold. What else are you doing with your portfolio at this point? So we did lengthen our bond portfolio. We did that last week. If you think about bonds, and this is where you've had a reprising the bond market, which has caused reprising the stock market, especially in those names that you mentioned to open up. You mentioned growth stocks. You mentioned meme stocks. You mentioned things that rely upon zero interest rates. At the beginning of the year, the Barclays Agria bond index yielded 1.5 to 1.75%. It now yields 5.2%. Longer bonds provide a hedge against a downturn, potentially a recession, and they provide a hedge against other bad and adverse actions such as geopolitics. And so I think I'm fearful that investors now think they should hide in cash, they should own the front end of the curve. They should extend their duration out just a bit. Second and third, we continue to like things in the US that are cheap. We like US small caps, as represented by the S&P 600, which are rallying heavy today, and are actually one of the best performers here today, as well as US mid caps. Those parts of the market are cheaper than large caps, and they've discounted the potential for earnings declines already, and they will do better on the opposite side. And so that's all in all kind of where we position our portfolio overall. All right, that's good stuff. Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer, Brent Shuddy, good to see you, sir. Thank you. Just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live, coming up the Deedas. Finally, cuts ties with Kanye West. What took him so long? Amazon is rolling at a new payment option for its US customers just in time for the holiday season. And earnings from Microsoft, Alphabet, to Poltlay are all on tap after the bell. We'll bring you the numbers and analysis as soon as they break.

4093," 🎵 What's your name? Shares of Adidas, as you can see down, just over 3% on the German exchange after the huge news that Adidas had indeed finally cut ties with Kanye West, who also goes by yay over a string of anti-Semitic remarks. The company saying this morning in a news release quote, Yees recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful, and dangerous and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness. Joining us now for a discussion on all this, Anjali Jenshundani, practitioner and resident, Sath University of New Haven and Sam Poser, Williams trading senior equity analyst, nice to have you both. Anjali will start with you. Why do you think it took Adidas so long to make what appeared to be an obvious move? You know, I think the financial implications really had their team thinking of how do they resolve this. We're in the fourth quarter. Everyone's racing to get to December and sales are really stressed. We have the holiday sales. We have aging inventory and this may have been their priority before they made the decision to really communicate what their brand values are and where they stand. Sam, you see the stock off just over 3% today, Adidas without the Yeesy partnership. What does that look like from a business perspective? Well, I mean, I thought when Kanye left Nike that really, Kanye wanted the keys to the castle at Nike, Adidas decided to give it to him and probably at the end of the day, it'll be better for Adidas, even though in the short term, likely, you know, they're going to lose some revenue. Are you surprised the stock is down just 3% Sam and you think the hesitation had something to do with the CEO transition, which happens early next year? I mean, the estimates are that I think it's about $2 billion that Kanye brings in and if that's accurate, I mean, I don't think those decisions are difficult. And I think as somebody mentioned earlier, they were one of the first ones to put it under root to put their agreement with him under review. I'm really messaging or reputation. Let's start there means everything to a brand. When you take a look at what that messaging then should be from Adidas at this point, since it did take them so long to respond, what are the next steps that they need to take in order to win back? Maybe some of the customers who don't necessarily trust them right now? Well, that's what it's all about is they've really broken trust with their customers and now they're really going to have to repair that, being able to communicate and communicating immediately and getting in front of the crisis is important. And when it comes to crisis management with any brand working with a celebrity, you need to have this in place crisis management. You can't control what a celebrity is going to say, but you need to know what your action will be and your leadership needs to be aligned on what messaging will be. Hope for the best plan for the worst. Okay. Sam, want to ask you about another statement that was part of Adidas announcement and it said it was interesting that lead you to wonder what's coming. Adidas is the sole owner of all design rights to existing products as well as previous and new color ways. Under the partnership, we may not know more until November 9th when they report. Does that lead you to believe Adidas may try to keep this brand alive under some different name and is there a legal challenge ahead? I was starting with the last question. I don't know. There already are, if you look at the website, some interpretations of some of the Kanye product under the Adidas logo. And I believe that may have been one of the reasons why Kanye was potentially trying to sever that relationship prior to today's announcement anyway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,74,2022-10-25 19:19:18
4094," other reasons why Kanye was potentially trying to sever that relationship prior to today's announcement anyway. So yeah, I mean these agreements that were made and the one with Nike and so on, the designs belong to the company, not to Kanye. So you know, what they're going to do and how that'll be received, I think are, you know, to be determined. And my guess is given that this is looking for a new CEO, that's not going to be an upcoming earnings revelation. I'm going to put a similar question to you, but what do you think from a branding perspective, from a marketing perspective, that they should do with the designs that they have from the easy collection and how they should address that then with the public? You know, I think they need to expand their portfolio. They really need to look to other influencers and other partnerships that can support them. The whole premise with working with him was to really attract a young customer. Gen Z, Gen X, millennials, they were attracted to this type of merchandise. If they have a gap in their portfolio, they need to think long term and they need to look at a strategy that'll be beneficial, not rely on a personality or celebrity. And how they do that, they'll really need to think about how they really reinvent their in-house design team. Ajali, for other companies, let's just say in this sector, what is the lesson here in terms of crisis management? Crisis management, your brand is your hero. So that is your voice and that's your messaging. So if you're going to do any type of partnership, you need to really evaluate the risk at hand. You need to be able to have a plan and understand what that roadmap looks like. Branding is about creating a value proposition. And when you are messaging anything, everything communicates. So really focus on your brand as the hero. Your product is the hero, and your messaging is what pulls customers in. That's what people are attracted to. Your brand values and your voice. Sam, you cover Foot Locker and the note that you just put out this morning, you said that Adidas cutting ties with Kanye will have an immediate effect, further increase challenges facing a footlocker today. What does that look like? Well, I mean, so Nike, we believe that Nike has reduced their allocations to Foot Locker. We think it's in the 800 million to a billion dollars at cost. And they also plan to expand their business with Adidas over the next few years to about two billion dollars. The only sort of instant sell out rapid sell out category of shoes they had from Adidas was Kanye. So that's a lot of business gone right away. And from what we understand, other parts of Adidas aren't doing quite as well. And as I wrote in the note, Foot Locker has a lot of open to buy dollars to buy things other than Nike. The question was and probably is more magnified today is do the consumers have the open the open to purchase when all that new product shows up that's not Nike. And that given what happened with Kanye today, that just got a lot worse for Foot Locker. It's certainly a challenging landscape before them. Sam Pozer, Angelie John Gendoni, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, coming up next, Elon Musk, reportedly taking another step in his bid to buy Twitter. We have the latest details. And just in time for Black Friday, Amazon, we'll start taking Venmo payments. What users need to know next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,75,2022-10-25 19:23:33
4095," One millimeter longmanuel AM muita kasih om separ, a Elon Musk has pledged to close the deal with Twitter by Friday. He did this on a conference call with the bankers helping to fund the acquisition. Of course, if you can't keep that promise, the trial between the tech billionaire and the social media platform will resume in Delaware courts. Now Musk is getting backlash from current Twitter employees after the Washington Post reported a plan to cut Twitter staff by 75 percent. Twitter has since denied that claim. The worried employees have reportedly penned an open letter asking the company to preserve the current headcount. Taking a look at Twitter stock today, moving to the upside you see shares by just around 2.8 percent. So Dave, when you take a look at the stock reaction, Wall Street getting more on board, I think a little bit more confident that this deal is going to happen. We did see Tesla shares give up some of its earlier gains shortly after this report from Bloomberg broke. But it does seem like at least a step in the right direction. 5 pm Friday though. That's the least there's a light at the end of the tunnel that this drama is finally open over. That letter that Time Magazine got a hold of that letter that's circulating inside Twitter that says a threat of this magnitude is reckless. Underminds our users and customers trust in our platform and is a transparent act of worker intimidation. So even though that drama is over, a whole new drama appears to be starting over and we begin to ask those questions, what does Elon Musk have in store for Twitter, how does he build them into a profitable company once he takes them private. And there is, let's just agree, no way he can fire 75% of employees and turn it into a profitable private company. Yeah, I don't think so. But I don't know, let's just say to assume the drama's not over, right? Drama's certainly not over. We will see more than 75% of the work hours from now. All right. We need to take a quick break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,76,2022-10-25 19:28:18
4096," We need to take a quick break. We need to take a quick break. We need to take a quick break. We need to take a quick break. We need to take a quick break. Thanks for joining our audience. We have closed our doors with a tent. This is my cooldesb with a screen on me. And tonight's distribution show. Following this provided little bit. We decided to press the screen according to episode 18. If we don't upgrade the screen then you won't something else. I've talked to most of everyone in the industry. clock and you don't want to go this way. another way for customers to pay just in time for the holiday season. Tech reporter Din Halley is here with the details. Dan, what do we need to know? That's right, Sean. There's going to be a new payment option available for Amazon users. They're rolling Venmo into the payment option offerings there. Once you start to finish up your potential shopping spree, you'll just be able to add your Venmo account there. You'll have to authorize it. And then once it's there, you can use that as one of your default purchase settings. Now, it's going to be rolling out slowly. It will be available by Black Friday for all users in the US. But you may start to see it as an option to add to that checkout portion of Amazon. And this obviously a big deal for PayPal. Venmo is owned by PayPal. So shares of PayPal are up more than 7% on the day as a result. And so this is, I think, just another way for Amazon to ensure that, however users want to pay, they'll be able to pay. They've added other options in the past. So this is just another extension of that effort going forward. Are there other platforms that accept the Venmo payment? Is there more coming down this road? Oh, yeah, there's plenty of other businesses that accept Venmo as a payment option. I think this is probably, obviously, one of the largest as far as commerce and e-commerce goes. But there's plenty of others out there. A lot of small shops actually use it as their primary means of payment. I mean, if you live in an apartment, chances are your landlord allows you to use Venmo as a payment option, although mine doesn't, and they need to get on that. But yeah, it is something that you're going to see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,77,2022-10-25 19:32:24
4097," Heyman, I mean, if you live in an apartment, chances are your landlord allows you to use Venmo as a payment option, although mine doesn't, and they need to get on that. But yeah, it is something that you're going to see go across more e-commerce platforms as we continue to see Venmo just really take over as a payment option for people in Gen X, Gen Z and millennials. Excited for that. CVS Uber, they allow a credit card. So I think a lot of us have been waiting for this. Dan Howley, good stuff. Thank you. The latest victim of inflation and rising rates is the Wall Street bonus. Wall Street profits are down over 50 percent in the first half of this year. And according to a report from the New York State Comptroller, that could mean a 22 percent drop in bank or payouts. Taking the biggest toll on these bonuses are investment banking fees, which plummeted from a record high in 21 as volatile markets in an uncertain economic outlook put an end to the surge in mergers and IPOs we saw during the pandemic. They have flat out disappeared, some stunning numbers, Shana, from the Wall Street Journal. Traditional IPOs have raised $7 billion this year. That is down more than 90 percent from last year and when did they come back? Exactly. I think that's a big question now as we look out over the next couple of quarters. Certainly seems like these challenging economic environment that we are currently in is going to last for quite some time. When you take a look at the average compensation last year for Wall Street, obviously a totally different scenario. But the average pay for bankers last year in New York City was $516,000 up from $438,000 the year before. That's more than five times the average private sector salary worker, including an average bonus of $257,000. So again, it was the highest bonus that we had seen paid since 2006, here just in terms of the numbers that we had seen recently. So a slowdown I think has been forecasted now for quite some time. That 22 percent drop though really shows how big of a slowdown we have seen in the economy and how they're simply like you said, no appetite out there at least for right now for the M&A and IPO deal. Yeah, the IPOs we've heard about may be happening. Clowna and Instacart eventually did not happen in terms of M&A activity. $504 billion in the quarter was the slowest we'd seen in five years with one exception. Q2 2020 when the pandemic was just getting underway. So yeah, it looks like this is here to stay and could last throughout the year and some on Wall Street paying that bill. All right. Coming up next, the backlog of ships at the Port of Los Angeles has dropped dramatically since the start of the year. We'll find out why. Back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,78,2022-10-25 19:36:49
4098," climbed precipitously over the last several months. Now, in the Trans-Pacific Theater, running from Asia to the United States, most of that business is contracted annually, and some decided to go multi-year on their agreements. The spot market is not a majority of the business, but it does have an influence when these rates drop like they have, on what folks are gonna be looking at in the quarters upcoming. And Jim, we've talked a lot about the shortage of truckers in the past, also the headwinds when it comes to some of the rails and the ability to get some of the product out. Where do those headwinds stand? Are they still a big challenge for the port of LA? Yeah, the supply chain is always in need of improvement, constant movement forward. What we've seen right now is that earlier this year, the rail volume increased by sixfold, and we collectively as an industry have had trouble keeping up with that. Until the recent eight weeks, we've seen rail volume idling at the port of Los Angeles dropped by more than 50%, same with those aging containers. I think we finally had the breakthrough on the rail that we finally needed. Truck volume has moved in really well. The time a container sits at the port of LA before it moves out by truck is at pre-pandemic times, meaning it's moving very fast. Circling back to the labor agreement which expired in July, what are the big holdups? When do you expect a deal to get done? Collective bargaining is hard. This is really tough work. You're not only trying to put a coast wide contract together for all 22,000 workers and the 29 ports that they support, but with those 29 ports, you have all local issues that must be solved in parallel with the big coast wide agreement. There's gonna be continued work. We've got season professionals at the table on both sides and as I mentioned, the service level has not deteriorated one Iota. We'll keep moving this cargo and let these folks concentrate on getting this deal done. We'd like to see it done now so we can send that market signal that we're ready. Are you confident though you'll get a deal before your end? That remains in question and we're gonna continue to work with all stakeholders I know from the Biden administration through Governor Newsom's office, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Arsetti and all of us pushing both sides to stay at the table and chip away at these issues. The sooner, the better for the American economy. Gene Sieroka, great having you in studio. Thanks so much for venturing out to the East Coast. We really appreciate it.

4099," every NHL do Time for a triple play. Three stocks that we are watching here in the final 15 minutes of trading. We have Weber GM and Canopy Growth process on set to help us break down some of today's big movers. Let's start with my play and that is Weber. The stock shooting higher today shares are soaring on a takeover bid from BDT capital. You can see the stock up 29% right now. The offer is to buy the shares that it doesn't already own for 625 a share. It's a 24% premium to Weber's closing price last night. You can see a trading just above that value today. City out with a note this morning saying that this bid could go even higher given where the stock was trading at the end of the summer. Wells Fargo more positive on the stock upgrading it to equal weight from underweight on the heels of this news despite today's jump though. Still trading well below its IPO price of $14 back in August of 2021 and process also bring up Weber today because there seems to be a lot of progress. There's just refocus on some of those mean trades. Weber has been grouped in with the mean trades over the last couple of months now. We have been beyond surging today. Game stop up nearly 10%. It seems like some of these trades are back in investors' favor at least. I heard Jared talking to you earlier about the mean trade back in Vogue. Weber a nice Chicago company that's run from some kind of partial to them. They had a nice run with the pandemic right. That was a big boom outdoor grilling things like that. Now seems like they're going back to be being a private company with this LBO or whatever this take going private. So interesting to watch there. Also sizzling around fire. I'm watching GM stock here jumping in the back of a big profit beat along with record revenue around 42 billion for the quarter. GM seeing the supply constraints easing and the automaker reaffirmed its ebit guidance of 13 billion to 15 billion for the year. CEO Mary Barrett said they were doing this reaffirmation because despite a challenging environment because demand continues to be strong for GM products. Also the EV game plan appears to be on track. They have materials in place for about one million units of annual EV capacity by 2025. Very optimistic. And then tomorrow we turn our attention to Ford and you wonder how much of the bad news is already baked in that stock down what I think 40 plus percent year to date because of that pre-announcement that they'd take a billion dollar hit, a surcharge and had 45,000 cars parked. You expect what are your expectations tomorrow? I think the big concern is that are they going to reaffirm their ebit guidance that they did last time because they need to follow GM. GM saying we're in a strong place. We've got strong demand. We're weathering these components shortage. We're in a good spot. So if we can Ford actually do that with the little warning of higher prices. Looks like GM may be the leader for now. My play in the pot stocks. Let's start with CGC at Trending Ticker right now on Yahoo Finance. Can it be growth? Speeding up its entry into the US market by consolidating its US assets into a new holding company.

Perhaps it's some polling yesterday from Monmouth University showing two thirds of Americans favor legalizing marijuana. And they keep part of that polling, Sean, 76 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans favor legalization. And once you get over the majority of Republicans, you start to get optimistic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,81,2022-10-25 19:49:44
4100," 76 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans favor legalization. And once you get over the majority of Republicans, you start to get optimistic about federal legalization and maybe some pressure on Republican senators. Maybe this will be the pressure that they do need because we know that that has remained stalled in Congress now for quite some time. They haven't had, at least to date, the necessary votes that they do need to pass it on a federal level, on a state level. The recreational use is going to be on the ballot in five states. We know it's already legal in 19 states, so that will be interesting to watch as we count down more about two weeks now from the midterms. So maybe if we do see more states pass a recreational use of marijuana, maybe we could see these stocks at least in the short term get another bump from here. I still say 2028. I'm pushing that way off. Still not overly optimistic for federal legalization, just too much opposition in the Republican Senate. Good to have you, Prost. Thanks for jumping in. A tough winter is coming for the media industry. New data showing layoffs are beginning to tick up again and more could be on the way. Yahoo! Finance is Alexandra Canal. It's here with the details. And, Ali, when you take a look at the media landscape, certainly changing over the last several years to say the least now it looks like some of those head ones that we've seen in over the last couple of months is going to continue into next year. Yeah, I think it's safe to say that media is an evolving business right now. There's that search for profitability. And then we have a lot of macroeconomic challenges as well. For an exchange pressure, losses of subscribers and linear television that slow down in ad spending and when you're looking to cut costs, layoffs is one strategy that a lot of these companies gravitate towards. We've seen many media companies from Netflix to CNN lay off employees. A reported 3,000 media jobs have been cut with more than one third coming from news media. I mentioned Warner Brothers Discovery. There's another major company that's dealt with intense cost-cutting measures. Most recently, it's television studio cut 26% of its head count. And what you're seeing on your screen now is the news that we got yesterday in an SEC filing the company plans to incur between $3.2 billion and $4.3 billion in pre-tax restructuring costs through 2024. The bulk of these charges between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion are tied to restructuring the content side of the business, so think the cancellation of the nearly completed backgirl film. We're moving a lot of that content that was in production in development. And ultimately, this is because David Zazov wants to keep that promise that he made to Wall Street slash $3 billion of costs over the next two years. Not the best picture, though, heading into earnings next week. What you want to see that, that girl? Everybody wants to see that movie and to see how bad it was, but they literally wrote it on. And that has been crazy. You know Warner Brothers Discovery is saying, was this worth the tax right all? It would smash if they released it because we all want to see how bad it is. Meanwhile, Game of Thrones, the spin-off, the numbers are in. What are we learning? Yeah, the prequel coming in, 9.3 million viewers in its season one finale. That's according to Warner Brothers Discovery. Now, that includes both linear viewers and HBO Max streams. And it's the most watched finale for an HBO series since Game of Thrones. That secured 19.8 million viewers in 2019. So didn't quite reach those levels, but still this is a brand new show. It's a rookie season. It's garnered a lot of critical acclaim. And on Sunday, there was a lot of competition. We had Sunday night football. We had the ALCS playoff baseball game, which, you know, go Phillies. If anyone has a lot of goals. I knew I am rooting for in the World Series, but still, this is great news for House of the Dragon. And Warner Brothers Discovery too. They really needed this to be a hit. So Phillies of the UNI will be watching those games very closely. Allie, while we have you, we also got news, Disney announcing its newest seasons of BBC's Doctor Who is going to actually be streaming on Disney Plus. How do you think that this or do you think it's going to significantly help grow that viewership? I think it's important when we think about the global reach of Disney Plus. This is definitely a global play since global audiences outside of the UK and Ireland are going to be able to watch this show on Disney Plus beginning in late 2023. Now, previously in the US, it aired on BBC America in recent years. I'm not sure if you guys are a fan of this show, but just judging off of the chatter that I saw online, it looks like worldwide. This does have some appeal. And as Disney is looking to expand its reach over...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,82,2022-10-25 19:53:58
4101," But just judging off of the chatter that I saw online, it looks like worldwide, this does have some appeal, and as Disney is looking to sort of expand its reach overseas, this could be a good move for them. This one really surprised me. I was shocked to see a trending. Is this a big deal, kids? It is. It has a very, very loyal fan base, I will say that. I will say that. Yeah. And then you could also point to the fact that that could then be a huge win for Disney Plus, because I think people that loyal fan base will be willing to pay the extra subscription costs, but we have been debating when you're going to cut it off when you're not. I think all these. It's all about these. Yes, this viewership base will actually upgrade. I think about something like Squid Game's for Netflix. You know, some of that international IP can translate and really have this cross appeal in the US as well. So we'll have to see how this does. Yeah, there's been a lot of that. Ali, can now good stuff. Thank you very much. Good to have you. All right, with about 20 minutes to go until the closing bell, let's check in on the action, heading into the close text docs outperforming. And look at the green on the board, the Dow up 337 points more than 1%. Continuing a hot streak from last week, the S&P 500 gained 4.7% last week. And now just continues to roll up 60 points. And look at the tech-heavy Nasdaq. I had all these big earnings we are expecting in just a couple of minutes, Shana, expectations we're seeing the Nasdaq pop. Yeah, exactly. Microsoft is going to be one of the big reports that we are going to be watching very closely. The company is expected to post its flow of sales growth that we have seen since 2017, a weakening economy, obviously, a strong dollar there. Potentially hurting the numbers that we're going to get from Microsoft Alphabet is also going to be in focus. Keybank cutting its price target on at the stock. I had these results. Exciting some skepticism of revenue growth, also the mounting concern out there about a downturn and what exactly that will mean for Alphabet over the coming quarters. Rate of growth is going to be something that the street is watching very closely advertisers pulling back on spending. We saw that in SNAPs report just last week. So I think the attention is really going to be on Alphabet in particular and also meta tomorrow to see if that slowdown also translated to those two companies. I have to imagine meta has more of a SNAP problem than, of course, Alphabet. Search seems to be holding up pretty strong in this environment. Interesting ahead of these earnings to see the NASDAQ holding on so strong. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bill on Wall Street, stay with us right here, on Yahoo Finance Line.到了",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,83,2022-10-25 19:58:33

And let's take a look at our some of our leaders today, cannabis stocks, that is MJ. That ETF is up over 8.5% followed by ARC, followed by meme stocks, IPOs, solar, home builders, retail, internet stocks, all of those really in the leadership position. You can get a pretty good picture here of what's going on by just looking at our meme stock board. We've seen this picture before at the beginning of some of these big flashy bear market rallies. We see a lot of movement into some of these fringe markets. Could be what we're seeing here again today. We'll check out the EV space, Tesla getting a lot of love. That's up 5% Elon Musk expected to close that transaction with Twitter on Friday going to cost him a lot, but hopefully he's done selling Tesla shares in order to cover that transaction cost. Also, God just got a tweet from somebody at Bloomberg that says that Elon Musk's personal is going to help sell some of that bank debt that they are taking on in order. So nice guy there. Let's take a look at the bank stocks. We see those largely in the green. Energy has been flagging a bit today. Mix picture here. Here's your closing bell on Wall Street. Markets. What you got to like with you seeing on the board, the Dow up 337 points on track for his best month since 2020, go figure up 337 points in the day and the S&P. We've been strong for the last seven days now. 62 points up 1.6%. The NASDAQ ahead of, excuse me, Alphabet and the Microsoft earning, surging 2.2% 246 points. We will bring you those earnings as they come in. But first, let's bring in Keith Loner, true as Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Chris Constantino's Riverfront Investment Group Chief Investment Officer. Nice to see you both, Keith. Let's start with you. What do you make of this continued rally? Well, first, great to be with you as always. Our view is heading into October. This market was the most oversold since the June lows. And we've been looking for relief. So I think what we're seeing here is some relief from an oversold condition, position in his light, as you head into a seasonal period. Now think about it, David, if you, we've had a really tough year. And if you're a money manager going into the end of the year, and you miss out on a fourth quarter rally, that's not acceptable. So I think just some anxiety. But our picture view hasn't really changed. Even though we've been expecting some type of rally here, we think the next 6-12 months are still more challenging. And as we move up to say 4,141 on the S&P, for those investors that are overweight risk, we would use that as an opportunity to become more defensive. Chris, what do you think, do you agree? Chris, Chris. Lead and hold off tema.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,84,2022-10-25 20:03:16
4103," Chris, what do you think? Do you agree? I don't know. It's not that it happened to Chris. Chris, can you hear us? I lost you guys there for a second, but you're back now. I'm sorry. Yeah, I was just jumping in. I was asking you just what you make of the rally that we've seen over the last three days. The gains really that we've seen over the last month or so. Does that do you think have staying power? Yeah. And also, thanks for having me. I have to say I agree with Keith here that one of the histories of bear markets, if you study them going back 30, 40, 50 years is generally in a prolonged bear market. You have pretty dramatic bear market rallies and they can be pretty frequent. And I think we experienced one from mid June to August. And we're probably getting another one now. Doesn't mean it doesn't isn't going to have staying power and doesn't mean it can't persist for some time. But color me a little bit skeptical that the overall complexion of this market has changed meaningfully. Because at the end of the day, the fed put is pretty much gone in our opinion. And the Federal Reserve has to prioritize getting inflation under control over pretty much everything else, including protecting the wealth of fact. Chris, what is your expectation that the next two fed meetings? I think they have to continue to walk the tightrope that they've been walking, right? I think it's they have to talk really tough on inflation because at the end of the day, I think that Chairman Powell wants to go down in history as the fed chairman that allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle 1970 style. So you have history working against in there in order, you know, so I think he has to stay pretty aggressive, pretty hawkish tone. But you want to, if I'm a fed chairman, you also want to keep the door open for, you know, for the chance you might overshoot in the financial conditions might tighten too much and you have to back off the fierce rhetoric. So they're going to have to walk that tightrope, but I expect, I mean, 75 basis points, I think are in the bag. And I think you have to expect between 50 and 75 the next one after that. At the end of the day, that is nothing even approximating an easy monetary policy. And I think we have to keep that in mind. Keith, what's your assessment of how much headway the fed has made up into this point? Well, they've had the most aggressive tightening policy in about 40 years. The issue is, you know, they started ultra loose. So, you know, they've been playing catch up the whole time. So I think they've come a long way. But, you know, if you think about it, I point of view is similar and so far as that we think the fed has caught issue now because of this inflation. That's happened the last year. So they're likely, you know, the best we can hope for is that they move rates up, you know, 75 basis points, maybe 50 or 75 and then hold them there. And the other one to point out is, you know, there's a part of this rally is an energized by what happened on Friday. Some, you know, speak that maybe the fed's going to become less aggressive. Well, our view is that would sparkle rally. But if you go back to 2000, 2007, again, we're not saying this is the same environment. Just because the fed's cutting rates doesn't mean that the market rally will be sustainable. A big, you know, a big point of view has to come down to whether we see recession or not. So I still think recession risk in 2023 is relatively high, especially when you look at the inverted yield curve leading economic indicators down for six months. Housing is the business cycle. Housing is soft and quite a bit. And even if we sidestep a recession, we just think at, you know, at 16 times earnings today on earnings that likely have downside pressure that the upside is likely capped around the 17 multiples. You know, five or 10% upside from here is likely the cap. So I trust even if we have a kind of a, you know, a soft land in which is not a base case, we think the upside for the market is somewhat capsule. You just have to be more tactical in this environment in our view. And that's what we've been doing this year. Chris, can we avoid a recession in your thoughts on Jamie Diamond over at the Davos in the desert in Saudi Arabia saying he's less concerned about a potential recession than he is about geopolitical events most notably the Russia Ukraine war. And of course, US China relations. Sure. So whether we can avoid a recession or not, the thing I'm really mostly focused on is corporate earnings. And if you look at the 1970s, what was kind of fascinating about the 70s is you had three or four recessions between the early 70s and the early 80s. But corporate earnings pullbacks during those recessions and nominal terms actually wasn't they weren't that dramatic. Nothing approximating the kind of earnings collapse who had in 2008 or even the brief one we had in 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,85,2022-10-25 20:06:57
4104," for earnings pullbacks during those recessions and nominal terms actually wasn't, they weren't that dramatic. Nothing approximating the kind of earnings collapse we had in 2008 or even the brief one we had in 2020. So what we may end up with is some sort of mild recession where corporate earnings stay a little bit more resilient than we're used to in the recessions of the past 20 years. And that's probably the most optimistic way you could see the market shaping up and how you might guess that some are between here and 10 percentage points lower than here is probably a pretty big longer term buying opportunity for the market. And that's about as optimistic as I can sound right now. We are, as Keith mentioned, we're in a very similar position that we've been very tactical this year. We are in risk management mode. We are underweight equities. But that is the way that I could see this shaping up without having to go through a prolonged 40% plus down two-year type of bear market like we saw on O8. To your question on geopolitics, I think geopolitics are filtering into the story around recession, story around corporate earnings, right? For me, the two geopolitical hotspots here, we have a hot war in Europe, which is contributing to the inflationary pressures the Fed's trying to fight. And that's not good for the market. And then the second piece of this is the cold war we have between the China and US, which in my eyes is only intensifying with the rhetoric coming out of China that we saw from the Communist Party Congress earlier this week. So those two pieces together have real market implications. And neither one of those is potentially a really great setup for the market. All right, we have to leave it there. Chris Kahn's and Tinos and Kepler and thanks so much for joining us. We have some breaking news. Microsoft earnings are out. Dan Halley has a number to say, Dan. That's right, Toronto. We saw a beat for the top M bottom line here for Microsoft revenue came in at 50.1 billion versus 49.6 billion expected. We saw earnings per share of $2.35 versus $2.29 expected. We also saw beats in the productivity business and processes, a in line with the intelligent cloud business. And then we also saw more personal computing actually beat with 13.33 billion in revenue. That was compared to 13.1 billion in revenue that was expected. This all comes as we've seen a collapse in the spending on DCs across the spectrum. We've seen Intel obviously struck by this, AMD struck by this in video struck by this cloud spending, though, for Microsoft was at 20% growth in Q1. That is a drop from 31% growth in Q1 last year. And we've seen that kind of continue to fall. It was 31% in Q1 2022. This is their fiscal Q1, obviously. 26% in the Q2 and Q3 and then down to 20% growth in Q4. So we're seeing that kind of growth really kind of continuing to fall year over year and staying stable, quarter over quarter, but a little bit lower than prior quarters for Microsoft there. So the cloud business doing all right, but not having that kind of growth that people are expecting. And as a result, we're seeing shares down around 1.5%. Yeah, as your revenue growth, Dan, 35% in the most recent quarter, that was compared to 40% growth in the previous quarter. Taking look though at the headline numbers, EPS and revenue, both beating the streets estimates day 50.1 billion on revenue, 235 on EPS, but cloud, it was a focus going into these results. And obviously the focus here and the big reason, like Dan said, why shares are falling that miss in terms of what the street was looking for when it comes to cloud is what's weighing on shares right now. Yeah, the big surprise there. We certainly all expected that to be strength leading strength there with the Erzur, but not the case. PC sales have been overall just a bit of a headwind there down 18%. And it's really surprising, I think, especially when we're going to get to Alphabet here in a moment, but surprising considering what we're seeing for them versus expectations. The strength of the dollar will be interesting to hear the commentary on the call to hear how the strength of the dollar did impact their overall numbers. We do have a quote from Sundar Pinchai, the CEO of, oh, that's no, we're going to get that from Alphabet here coming up after we get to Jared Blicker. So let's go ahead and do that. Jared, you have the Alphabet numbers in. And that's what I'm saying. A bit of a surprise here is those begin to come in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,86,2022-10-25 20:11:16

The company has a high-end price of $1.5 million. The company has a high-end price of $1.5 million. The company has a high-end price of $1.5 million. The company has a high-end price of $1.5 million.

4107," But after hours, investors very pleased with the news to Pulte continues to show their resilience. You know, taking a look at some of these numbers here, restaurants that the company opened during the most recent quarter, 43 new locations, all but five, including a Chipotle, that's dry through lanes, reserved for the digital order pickup, which is becoming a larger part of the business for the fourth quarter, Chipotle predicting same store sales growth in mid to high single digits, like I said before. But by the end of 2022, it's forecasting that's going to open between 235 to 250 new restaurants by the end of the year. For next year, the company projecting to open another 255 to 285 new locations there. So I also want to point out Chipotle's board approving an additional 200 million to buy back. To buy back its shares here. Again, the stock moving higher after hours, Dave, shares up just around 3%. We want to go get more on alphabet earnings. Take a look at how the stock is reacting shares. Still off, I think, after hours we want to bring in Ali Moghrabi. His morning starts senior equity analyst. And Ali, when you take a look at alphabet shares here, off just around a 5%, what do you make of this report? Yeah, it's to a certain extent. It was disappointing. What I would point to is mainly the YouTube ad revenues. It was actually a decline year of year. Part of that, of course, was the foreign currency headwinds or foreign exchange headwinds. But that's a little bit disappointing. On the bright side, of course, the cloud side of the business is doing very, very well. Their rate of growth, I think, was a little bit higher than what Microsoft reported earlier. So I think what you're basically seeing is with the economic downturn, a lot of advertisers are becoming more hesitant. They're maybe holding back a little bit of their head spending, but at the same time, even during an economic downturn, you're seeing the importance of that digital transition, of that cloud migration, which continues to happen, from which, of course, we've seen Microsoft and Google up to now benefit. What's your reaction to the cloud number? I think it was pretty impressive. I think the market had expected a little bit more of a slowdown in terms of the growth, but the growth was still very, very strong. And again, as I said before, I think what that really indicates is that even within an economic downturn, possibly coming along, the businesses continue to see the long-term cost savings, which with regards to migrating to the cloud. Holly, when you take a look at some of the comments here from Asun Dupertai in this report, working to realign resources to high growth, sharpening focus on a clear set of priorities to you, what do those priorities include? I think it includes further monetization or more effective monetization of YouTube. They've launched YouTube shorts, and some of those viewing numbers are actually pretty impressive. But in terms of attracting the advertisers to that at inventory that YouTube shorts continues to increase, or I should say, create, they're probably having a little bit of difficulty on that front. So I think what they need to focus on or what they are probably planning to focus on is the main side of the business, which is advertising. Let's monetize the huge user base that we have, even more effectively. Search, of course, continues to do well, so that's not an issue. And in the other one, of course, is let's continue to diversify our business as consistent land as effectively as we have last few years, which is push for further cloud business growth and continue to attract enterprises onto the platform. Sounded talked about what Sundar Pinchai said today, but rewinding back to what he said about a month ago about the company need to become 20% more productive, kind of looms over this report. How do they get there? Yeah, I think a few ways. One, of course, is to slow down increase in that headcount. They have another one is which we've seen historically with a lot of technology companies. One thing to keep in mind is that the technology industry is very disruptive. So companies that continue to dominate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,89,2022-10-25 20:24:15
4108," We have a lot of technology companies. One thing to keep in mind is that the technology industry is very disruptive. So companies that continue to dominate the markets that they're in, such as an alphabet or a Google, still need to invest in innovation coming up with new ideas, possibly new business models. So I think one part of this change in strategy would be, let's, again, as I mentioned before, focus more on what is currently working and what we're ahead of, which is the advertising side and business and, of course, the cloud side. So you could see less R&D on innovation or on products and or business models that probably will be generating revenue nor, of course, within the next five to seven years. So taking those steps, I think, will allow them to operate a lot more efficiently and, of course, will necessary push them to continue to increase take count at the rates they have during the last five years. So, Lee, here we are after hours of stock and out trading right around a 98-14, if it does, in fact, open where we are trading after these results. You have a fair value on the stock at 169. What needs to happen in order for Wall Street to get more on board here with Alphabet's new vision? Well, it's, I think for Alphabet specifically, it's more of a macro issue. So again, as I mentioned, the economic downturn is impacting at, at spending overall. And of course, these days, most of it is digital at spending. So I think this problem, this name requires a lot of bit of patience. But in terms of, you know, remaining a cash gap continue to remain profitable. And of course, making headway on the B2B side of the business, which is cloud, I think they continue to do very, very well. Questions for the call if you had one? Sure. What I would ask is that is what I would be interested in is, is YouTube shorts actually impacting engagement time on regular YouTube? And the reason I'm asking that is because management of snaps at that earlier last week. So it would be interesting. And if that's the case, then we should expect Google to even more aggressively try to monetize YouTube shorts and or of course, sell the ad impressions that they continue to generate. And we, I knew you mentioned some of those macroeconomic headwinds here, a strong dollar. We've heard that from a number of companies here, how big of a headwind do you think this is specifically for alphabet? For the short to, for the short to medium term, it is a headwind. I mean, there's no question. Again, ad spending is dependent on overall economic growth. But in the long term, as we see turn around in the economy, I think these guys will be back on track and will continue to lead the way when it comes to digital ad spending. All right, Ali Mourabi, always great to have you. Thanks so much for having me here for instant reaction and alphabet shares off just around a 6%. Coming up next, Chipotle's stock, moving to the upside here after the strong results that we just got from the company shares up, 3.6% will get an analyst take on the numbers that we're getting when we come back. Do do do or do what we said, That's. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same.

Let's take a deeper dive into these Chipotle numbers. Let's bring in Morningstar Equity, analyst John Dunlop. Yahoo, finances, Rook Depauma's here with us as well. Nice to see you both, so Sean, your reaction to the numbers. Yeah, I think broadly positive. You know, clocked in more or less on the money with sales a little bit ahead of us on EPS. And it's starting to look like it may be time to call the bottom on restaurant margins. The company is being able to price through, you know, mid-single digit to high-single digit on pricing. You saw Comp Sales clock in at 7.6%. So even as we're starting to see a bit of a traffic return to the office, the company didn't see a massive drop-off in traffic, which is encouraging. On the development side, 43 net new units maintained guidance for the year, and it looks like 8.5% or so at the midpoint for next year. So I'd say net positive all around. And let's take a step back. Morningstar highlighted that Chipotle was one of the best recession performers. Back in 0809, here we're seeing shares rising in after hours training, the CEO noting consumer discretionary spending tightening a bit. But do you think Chipotle ultimately stands as a recession-proof stock once again here? Yeah, recession-proof might be a little bit of a misnomer, but it's certainly recession-resistant. And I think what you see is a lot of consumers that might trade out of higher-priced full-service menus will trade down into fast-casual or QSR-plus, which is sort of that niche that Chipotle sits in. So even though they'll have a subset of consumers that may trade towards relative value, like a QSR pizza or like McDonald's, you've got another subset that's stringed back down into the category. So net net then ended up being a lot less sensitive than you would think at first blush. And one thing that really drove this quarter ultimately was those higher prices. In August, they took higher pricing for the third time in 15 months. Do you see that continuing higher prices continuing to the end of the year? And how do you see the consumer willing to put up with those higher prices at a fast-casual chain, like Chipotle? Hi. Yeah, it's a great question. So I believe that took price in the middle of August. And that was the last planned price increase for the year, but you're still looking at ballpark 8 to 9 percent price in that fourth quarter. And as you hold that against guidance for comparable store sales, you can see that the implication is that traffic and average check combined are probably about flat. So there's sort of two levers there. One, you're seeing a return to sort of downtown urban markets, which means that you're seeing a lot more single-on-trade orders. And that's going to pull your average check down. The good news is that means that traffic may continue to be positive in terms of total transaction counts. So net net, the consumer continues to bear it, but definitely something that we're monitoring as we move forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,91,2022-10-25 20:33:09
4110," news is that means that traffic may continue to be positive in terms of total transaction counts. So net net, the consumer continues to bear it, but definitely something that we're monitoring as we move forward. What is your reaction to digital sales? And is there any surprise to the downside in this report to you? Yes, digital sales, obviously, declined a little bit on a linked quarter basis. We're down around 37% from I believe 39% last quarter. That's not totally unusual. About 20% of Chipotle's sale makes ties to delivery sales to higher cost channel and a lot of the time those customers trade out of the category entirely rather than down the menu. So we actually we saw that we saw similar results with dominos earnings a couple of weeks ago. And also I want to highlight when we spoke to Chipotle CEO last week, we also touched on that fast act recovery act that's happening over in California that could impact higher wages, expansion in California. How do you think that sort of plays in after seeing these results in Chipotle's expansion plans and also on that hourly wage? Yeah, two really good questions. It's the fast act. You're talking about about a $22 wage floor and of our publicly traded restaurant company, Chipotle is the most exposed one because they own their own restaurant units. It's not really a franchise concept. And then two because 15 to 20% of the unit count sits in California. So historically there's not really been a close tie between average wages and restaurant profitability. But the problem is that restaurants are so much more dependent on hourly labor relative to grocery stores or sea stores that we may start to see a little bit of a mixed shift that that's the real issue with the fast act. So I've sitting that a little bit on the growth narrative side. It's nice to see the success we've seen in rural areas. Hopefully the firm's able to lean into that a little bit and defray some of the explosive pressure there. For 2023 they're projecting 255 to 285 new location openings back to Brooks question. Do you think paying that additional labor charging California could hamper those expansion plans? Yeah we certainly haven't modeled in yet and we haven't heard anything from restaurants themselves. But it would make sense all else equally. You've got higher labor costs. You've got soft unit economics that the payback periods would lengthen and maybe it would be more appropriate to look for investments outside of that market. Really with the fast act the long-term implication for investors ties to more if that happens anywhere else. If we see that sectoral bargaining extend beyond California to maybe in Illinois or in Oregon or some of the more progressive states. They're betting big on Chipotle's here. We saw 43 new restaurants, 38 locations including a Chipotle. You highlighted in your note that those ultimately drive higher sales. Are you encouraged that most of these new units include that drive through? And do you think that term Chipotle is really sticking here? Yeah it's a good question and I think they would shy away from using the term drive through because they actually have certain zoning restrictions that are tied to those drive through units that Chipotle is trying to circumvent. So it lets you put in what's tantamount to a drive through in a lot of pads that wouldn't necessarily permit that otherwise. Basically the thrust you know 88% of net new units had Chipotle in this quarter. The economics are better. They do about 10 to 15% more sales. You have a higher volume of digital sales, about 50 to 55% relative to 40 to 45% for a normal unit. And then those those tend to be the highest profit margin sales those order ahead and pick up in store sales. So what's not to like I guess you come right down to it. The cash and cash returns are about 60 to 65%. Meaning you get your money out of those in less than two years. Still never seen at Chipotle in myself broke. I don't know about Sean. I go to there all the time. Never seen it. Sean I know you got a jump to the call but what do you want to hear on this call coming up? Yeah I'd like to hear the reiterate that commitment to unit growth for the longer term. I've got that 8 to 8% to 10% annual target. And then I'd also like a little bit more color about what drove sort of the the flat price mix and traffic because if it is traffic then you start to see a little bit of concern with consumer trade down. Indeed good stuff Sean. Dunlap appreciate you being here. Brooke DiPoma as well. Thank you both. Alright coming up Microsoft is moving to the downside just more than 2% after its Q3 earnings we'll take a closer look at what's driving it down after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,92,2022-10-25 20:37:17
4111," music the market. Let's take a look at Microsoft. Look at that shares of a 2% right now despite beating on both the top and bottom lines here to break this down. We want to bring in Rishi, Julia, RBC capital markets, software equity analysts. Rishi, it's great to see you so that softer cloud revenue really seems to be weighing on shares. What's your take away from the results that we're getting this afternoon? Yeah, and always great to be back here. Look, I think that's your absolute right. That's what's driving on the cloud. I think that's what we're getting this afternoon. We're getting this down a little bit. You know, there were worries heading to the quarter on PC weakness and stuff, but really, especially in earnings, this name is driven by the cloud number and very specifically Azure. And I look Azure came maybe about a point light of where, you know, the company had guided last quarter. And so I think people are looking at that. People are looking at commercial bookings and kind of expecting things to slow down further from here. Now, the tone on this name could turn in on a dime. So, it's a little bit more about the number of sales that you're going to get. And so they provide guidance that talks about better Azure growth for next quarter. But right now, because Azure was a little bit light, I think that's what's driving the stock down in the aftermarket, in spite of the top line and bottom line beats. And what you read into the how much the PC sales impacted earnings? Yeah, I think that was probably where the gross margins were a little light was because of the weak PC sales because remember, with PC sales, windows OEM is a big driver that's a very high gross value for the PC sales. And we've all seen the data points to it. That's probably what drove the miss on the gross margins. Now, I think it was really encouraging that their operating margins were kind of in line and at a good place. And, again, we got the EPS because gross margins were a little light. I think that's directly attributable to the windows OEM. When you take a look at this demand for the cloud computing business, really starting to taper, I mentioned the fact that Azure here, cloud services revenue, growth of 35% compared to 40% growth in the previous quarter, what do you think Microsoft needs to do in the future?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,93,2022-10-25 20:42:17
4112," the fact that Azure here, cloud services revenue, growth of 35% compared to 40% growth in the previous quarter. What do you think Microsoft needs to do in order to maybe get back some of the momentum? Or will we maybe never see that 40 to 50% growth that we have become accustomed to? Yeah, I don't want to say never, but I think the fact of the matter is we are heading into whether we want to call it a recession or not. We're heading into a softer or tighter macro environment where you're going to hear this on the call, you hear this from all the software vendors. There's just more layers of approval to making buying decisions. Azure, remember, is primarily on a consumption model and consumption models are where the slowdown is going to show up first, rather than your typical kind of seat based subscription model. So I think because the macro is deteriorating, I think that is going to continue to weigh on Azure numbers going forward. I also think as we kind of get visibility into an economic recovery, we're going to see Azure maybe even reaccelerate coming out of that. So I don't want to say that that 40% type growth number is off the table, right? And Azure still grew 42% constant currency, right? Like, remember, we got to consider the foreign currency headwinds here. So 42% is still pretty healthy growth. I just don't want to say that number continue to decelerate too much. To that point, how much does the strength of the dollar impact the report today? Yeah, it was about a 5% headwind growth, right? Which was kind of in line with how they talked about, you know, with the name, it's not surprising. The US dollar is going to continue to get stronger, especially if you look at what's going on in the macro picture in Europe in the UK, in Australia, in Japan. So I think currency will continue to be a weight on everything. I think the good news though is investors by now have gotten conditioned to look at everything on a constant currency basis, right? Strip out the impact of a strong dollar or maybe in the future, a weak dollar and look at kind of what is going on with the underlying business. Frisci, when you take a look at the revenue from sales of Windows licenses, dropping 15% year over year worse. And that outlook that we initially got from Microsoft, what do you make of the significance of that drop? Yeah, I mean, to me, the big significance is just it's a matter of the weak PC demand, right? And that's not a surprise. Part of it is, remember, you had strong device demand as a result of COVID and the initial outlay of work from home. At some point, we knew that was going to fade. So I think we're starting to see the impact of that as well as just, you know, tightening of IT budgets. There's also the impact of, you know, even though we're at full employment, we know headcount growth is definitely starting to slow down if we look at the public job posting data, especially at tech companies. Not to mention there are some with actual layoffs going on. So I think that's what's contributing to that and why we're seeing weak PC data and it flows through to the, you know, Windows OEM business. And again, that's just hits on the gross mark inside. But, you know, ultimately, the strength of Microsoft is, I think, really going to be driven by the cloud computing. And so as long as Azure continues to put up good numbers as long as office continues to put up good numbers, I think this name can hold in well. Well, you want to hear what's the one thing you're looking for to hearing about more on the call? Yeah, to me, the one thing I want to point to or what I want to hear is they continue to strengthen Azure, right? Because that's where all the fears are is that Azure on this consumption model is going to slow down further from here. If, you know, sat the on Amy, get on the call and talk about Azure being more resilient than people expect and give a guidance that, you know, starts at the forehandle for Azure for next quarter on a constant currency basis. I think that would, that would make me very happy. If I were an investor, I think I would be very pleased with that. Appreciate you taking a look at the performance so far this year, Microsoft of 26% comparing that to the S&P, which is off between 19 and 20%. What's it going to take to turn it around? Because like you said before, the macroeconomic headwinds here is proving very challenging, not only for Microsoft, but obviously for a number of its competitors as well. Yeah, and, and, and you bring up a great point, which is we actually think, and this is one of the reasons Microsoft is one of our top picks to be defensive in this environment, is we think Microsoft can actually consolidate budgets, right? There's going to be a lot of point solution vendors beat on the productivity side or insecurity where Microsoft can really consolidate budget and actually emerge stronger coming out of the recession than they've been right now. But in terms of what it takes, I think two things need to happen. Number one, investors need to gain confidence that, you know, numbers aren't going any lower.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuX9IXzHLV4,94,2022-10-25 20:46:02
4113," out of the recession than they've been right now. But in terms of what it takes, I think two things need to happen. Number one, investors need to gain confidence that numbers aren't going any lower, which is obviously a tricky balancing act. And I think number two is interest rates are still impacting everything in software and really everything in tech. And so when we get to a point where interest rates kind of plateau and we know interest rates are gonna keep going up 50, 7,500 Bips, I think that could be really when Microsoft starts to work. All right, good stuff. We'll have to leave it there, Rishi Jalori. I appreciate you being here. Thank you. All right, take a look at shares of Warner Brothers Discovery down less than 1%. Edging lower after hours, the company announcing moments ago that director James Gunn and producer Peter Safran will become the co-heads of DC studios. And it goes into effect November 1st. This move coming at a critical time of the company is CEO David Zazlov reshapes the media giant and the wake of the merger between Warner Media and Discovery. Gunn and Safran are no stranger to the superhero movie genre. They have experience with both Marvel and the DC universe, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

4114," Alphabet are looking at shares decline here after hours of company missing on both the top and bottom lines. YouTube ad revenue falling during the quarter to 7.1 billion. That's meant the street was for 7.4 billion. Off nearly 6% after hours year to date shares off 27%. Moving on to Microsoft, that stock under pressure as well, despite beating on the top and bottom lines. What Wall Street is focused on is that cloud revenue growth that disappointed during the quarter that suffered an expected cloud revenue weighing on shares here. Azure revenue growth of 35% was down from 40% in the previous quarter. Taking a look at the intelligent cloud business overall revenue there. Tilling 20.3 billion Microsoft shares off nearly 1.7% now in extent to trading year to date off 25%. Taking a look at Spotify, you see shares selling off there after hours weaker than expected forecast. For fourth quarter growth margin, that's what's weighing on the stock was shares off just around 6% third quarter numbers revenue coming in line 21% growth on year over year basis. A monthly active users a key number here 456 million that's up 20% year over year and better than expected despite that though. Stock off a 6% over the past three months you're looking at a drop of just around 12% year to date. Let's pull it up there off 58% taking a look at Mattela another decline here after hours shares off nearly a 5% lower full year profit guidance larger hit from the stronger dollar that is weighing on the stock here for a third quarter sales or flat profit also decline concerning here as we head into the very important as we are in the very important a holiday sales period. Look at year to date stock off just around 8% comparing that to the broader market Mattela is actually fair relatively well and rounding out with Texas instruments here you see the stock off just around 5% fourth quarter revenue and EPS guidance coming in light the company saying that they see weakness brought into the industrial market they expect most markets to decline sequentially there obviously that's reflected in the after hours move inventory below desire level also see order cancellations increasing during the current quarter taking look year to date Texas instruments off just around 14% extended trading after these numbers broke shares off about 5% day lot of losses here across the board.

4115," Inflation is already hit your grocery list and certainly your gas tank and with Halloween less than a week out, candy prices are now equally frightening. According to data company Clover, many of your favorite Halloween classics are up well more than 10% this year, Reese's peanut butter cups. The goat, we're up 14% this year, or Hershey's bar is up 15%. Bag of skittles up 10% kind of chocolate eggs are up 16% and twizzlers up 9% shrink flation. And also part of the equation as well with manufacturers downsizing products as ingredients, labor and transportation costs of skyrocketed. In this case, look, they could probably get a lot of pricing power here. Those are inflation recession proof. We're going to pay whatever they do. Yeah, exactly. I don't think people have a lot of choice, especially if you want trick or treaters for Halloween, if it's not just for yourself, if you're looking to give it out, you have to pay or you're more inclined to pay, I think those higher prices. We take a look at the overall spending that we're expected to see on candy this Halloween. It's expected to reach an all time high, a 3.1 billion we've talked about in the past, a record 10.6 billion dollars could potentially be spent on Halloween this year. Davey mentioned peanut butter cups as the goat greatest of all time. I do agree with you on that number two. We can agree on that. Across the US, the second favorite and you agree and we also agree with the rest of America. I came in at number one. Second top favorite Skittles, M&Ms at three hot tamales though. Number five kind of took me a little bit by surprise when we take a look at these types of prices here, more and more expensive. Maybe people aren't going to be curtailing their spending as we head into Halloween. Post Halloween though, we could potentially see a big drop in candy sales. The real test is what do you hand out? Do you go full size? Because I know Halloween is big in your hood. It is really big in my hood. You know, yeah, my husband will probably want to get out the full size candy bars knowing him. I'm probably going to have to rain it in just a little bit, especially with these prices. It's not the most financial sound advice, you know. Yes, we're always out trick-or-treat. We leave out the bucket, the first two kids show up, they empty it into their bag and... And it's all downhill from there. All right, well that does it for us today. I'm Yahoo Finance Live.

4120," Yeah, look, I think this quarter from Hillin' only suggests that we'll get some good results in a merit in a couple days as well, maybe even an Airbnb, but be interested in see if these results start to get embraced by the market. Yeah, we shall see. Alright, Chipotle is out with an earnings beat, but also with a warning about store traffic and we'll dig into the results which Chipotle CFO jack heart on next. Ah smells so good in times of looking at minds. And those people don't care so much. And just the way it is. bullying is out with an earnings beat as its higher income clientele was able to absorb higher prices for burritos and burrito bowls. The company did warn on two fronts. Store traffic and spending trends among lower income consumers. Chipotle, CFO, Jack Hartung joins us now to discuss. Jack, always nice to see you. On the conference call last night, I thought you guys were defending the price increases that you have pushed through noting the high big portion sizes and what you do in terms of cutting ingredients. Do you think, or are you just concerned about some of the price points on some of the products now? No, you don't probably. We watch this very, very closely. When we've raised prices over the last couple of years, and let's face it, it's been a high inflationary period. It's been the highest inflation I've seen in my entire career. When we take prices, we've looked at a number of things. We look at what our competitors are charging. We look at what happened the last time we took a price increase, and are we seeing any evidence that customers are either trading down or if they're reducing their transactions. Everything we see looks good. I know this is an environment where we have macro challenges. We talked about on the call that we do have some of our lower income consumers. Are appearing back on their dining out experiences, including at Chicole, but our higher income customers are actually coming more often. We're not seeing any kind of change in their behavior based on any of the pricing action that we've taken over the last year and a half. Jack, you know what I mean? I go to Chipotle all the time, but are you concerned that a portion of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,1,2022-10-26 13:49:01
4121," behavior based on any of the pricing action that we've taken over the last year and a half. Jack, you know, you know me, I go to Chipotle all the time, but are you concerned that, you know, a portion of the US is getting shut out of that really good Chipotle experience? And that now maybe you need to touch that third rail and do a value meal or maybe cut the bull in half and do $5 bull to get consumers in. Yeah, you know, we had this exact discussion the last time during the Great Recession where we saw consumers did start to, you know, reduce their dining experiences. And with Chipotle, during that time, even though our comms held up better than every other restaurant company, we stayed positive throughout that entire time. Our transactions were actually slightly negative, but negative. So we did see some transactions actually dip. As the recession was starting to end, our transactions came roaring back and we had double digit comms from there. So we've seen this before and during that time, we did talk about should we offer value meals? Should we offer a bundled meal where the consumers can eat for at the time it was less than $5. Our customers said, great idea. Go ahead and do it. And then when we tested it in restaurants, nobody bought it because everyone said, well, I love my chicken bredo. So I'm coming from my chicken bredo or my steak bredo. So we don't think Chipotle is the brand that somebody's looking for a dollar menu or a bundled meal. They come to look for customization, real culinary, and they create the food that most customers get the same exact on-treat every single time. And that's what they crave. And so, and when we look at our chicken bredo, which is what more than half of our customers get compared to competitors, we're under $9 for chicken bredo. And when you get a chicken on-treat at other fast casuals, you can't find any for under $10 and typically it's in that $11 to $13 range. So we still think we're at great value. Jack, what about the people that come to Chipotle for lunch particularly? And when it relates to that traffic, how you're looking through where some of the office occupancy that still isn't at pre-pandemic levels and is still in some cases data from castles suggesting it's lower than 50% of that pre-pandemic level and really only expected to take up sometime in 2023. What would you be tracking with regard to the relation of return to work or return to office and how that plays out for Chipotle going into next year? Yeah, when we look at our urban restaurants and we've, urban restaurants are a relative minority of our entire portfolio of over 3000 restaurants. So we've got somewhere in that 100 to 150 restaurants that are true urban. When we look at that cohort compared to all of the restaurants, they've been outcompanying the rest of the system for the last year or year and a half or so. And that makes sense based on people are returning to the office. Now it's not all the way back, but I would say it's within kind of 10 or 15% in terms of where the urban restaurants are compared to non-urban. So it's not all the way back, but it's not, it's not like it's anywhere near. You mentioned that 50% occupancy. We're doing way better than that. Hey, Jack, it's Julie here. So transactions down by about 1% last quarter. Do you have any sense of what that number could be this quarter? And I guess I'm trying to get a feel for where you think we are in the cycle. We're all grappling this morning looking at big tech earnings about how much worse things could get from your perspective. How are you thinking about that question? Yeah, we have a unique challenge in the fourth quarter because we introduce as a limited time offer brisket last year in the fourth quarter. And it was highly, highly successful. So we're comparing against that very, very difficult comparison. So contributing to the quarter is it's going to be a little bit more negative transactions. We think it's going to move from the 1% down that you mentioned in the third quarter to somewhere in the low to maybe the mid-single digit, you know, transaction being down in the fourth quarter. But as we move away brisket, we actually could only secure enough supply to run that promotion through the middle. And I remember that's how successful it was. Once we get past that, we think that the comparison will get a little bit easier. But we do think from a macro standpoint that the lower end consumers are dining out less often. So we do think that that's going to be a challenge for not just to pollate, but I think the restaurant industry for probably the next few of net several quarters. Jack, I don't know if you can see, but my out-of-fiance team never sees it to amaze me. We have some of the photos. There I am right there about a week ago in the base short, Chipotle. I got my usual order that is all for me. Two bowls right there. I ordered the same thing last night. I went to pick it up $48.23. Now I could double me. I understand. But do you think you could put... Let's see some guac on there. There's a lot going on there. I get it. But do you think you could push through more?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,2,2022-10-26 13:53:05
4122, in twenty three cents and i get double me and i understand but do you think you can walk on their is not going on that i i get it but do you think you could push through more price uh... i'm still shopping in there i'm still going to polly but do you still have more room to push through more price increase in the fourth quarter next year you think i think we do brian win i mean listen to how many people eat like you do i think that tribute to i don't know if your exercise or team but the fact that you can eat two balls like that you look as good as you do i appreciate that's why we have to always have you but but i don't think we have room but we don't have any plans right now to raise prices again it depends on commodities but what i do know is that when we look at competitors others have raised prices to our last couple years so the gap in terms of value for to put the compared to the others still exist but right now if commodities behave themselves we don't have any plans to take any more price for a while okay and so in the near term then because you still got the affluent consumers are the people that are ordering double guac double meat like when you think about the ticket sizes that you're seeing is there there is zoomed in is there a material difference in ticket size even among the outsized affluent consumer that you're seeing make up the majority of the revenues right now it's it's not huge there there is like a mid-single to get difference it's a slight difference really the difference is and this is what tells us it's more about a macro it's not that people are resisting you know when we raise prices it's 4% on a eight or nine dollar breeder it's 30 40 cents so we don't think that consumers are affected by that 30 or 40 cents within consumers are deciding can i eat out at all or if i'm gonna eat out do i have to you know maybe go down to another class to traditional qsr because it's just a different category for them jack good to see you to pull at least a foe jack heart town talking us through the quarter and what's beyond thanks so much thank you guys well coming up political debates across the country continue with midterm elections around the corner Rick Newman is going to share the details next huh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,3,2022-10-26 13:57:37
4123," The midterm election is only weeks away and last night included some heated debates in both Pennsylvania and New York. Democrat John Federman and Republican Mehmet Oz clashed during a testy Pennsylvania Senate debate last night. The two disagreed over many issues including the economy and abortion. Young finances, Rig Newman joins us now with some of the takeaways. This is one of the, I think, one of the most watched races, right, around the country. What was your impression of the debate last night? One of the most watched races for two reasons. Number one, it could determine who controls the Senate, Republicans or Democrats, and also because of John Federman's health. He had a stroke earlier this year and I think a lot of people who watched last night just wanted to know how was he going to do? So mixed reviews on that. I watched it. I thought he held up pretty well and I know how draining an experience like that can be for somebody recovering from a stroke, but the reviews were pretty weak. He did stumble over words. He got some things wrong. Some of his responses just were not very well developed. But on the other hand, he was somewhat coherent. So the real question is, could this guy do the job if he gets elected to the Senate? And one of the most interesting things about this race Julie is going to be how much does his health actually factor in? Will voters in Pennsylvania will they will they be inclined to vote against him because of health concerns or will they say no, they don't really worry about that. So quite interesting. And as you mentioned, it did clash on the issues over abortion and fracking and some things like that. So very interesting race in Pennsylvania. Yeah, only one of them actually lives in Pennsylvania as well. So that's a great noting. Rick, additionally here, we know you're following the races in New York. What was taking place there on the debates? Well, that was the governor's race between Kathy, Hocal, the incumbent and Lee Zeldin, the Republican congressman who's challenging her. You would think Hocal is is a lot of a talk in this race, but this has also been tightening. Again, abortion was one of the big topics last night. So if Zeldin is able to to win and become a Republican governor, York, that would that would be an upset for sure. And if we were to see that, I mean, that would be indicative of a complete wipeout for Democrats. There is some new, there are some new forecasts suggesting that the Democrats are going to do better in the house than expected. The Cook Political Report, which is one of the top forecasters now saying they could pick up something like 25 seats or more in the house. That's up from their forecast, their prior forecast. So at the last minute here, things seem to be breaking in favor of Republicans. Y'all are finances on Rick Newman. Rick, thanks so much for breaking this all down. Get an eye on the political spectrum. Coming up, everyone, on the other side of this show, break chairs of Alphabet. They are lower by them. What is 7% right now? After YouTube revenue, took a hit in the third quarter, our VC Capital Brad Erickson joins us next to discuss. Peek Brad.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,4,2022-10-26 14:01:44
4124," MUSIC Welcome back to Y'all Finance. I'm Brian Sasi here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Smith, mixed action in the markets on this Wednesday morning on the beak of back, beak, back of weakest earnings reports from tech giants, Google and Microsoft. At least right now we're pushing the dow up about 91 points, the S&P 500 Nazx slightly in the red. Here's what we have on tap for you this hour. The Google pullback, RBC's Brad Erickson, stops by for a take on Google's less than stunning quarter and outlook. And maybe not so playful holidays, but tell Surf's up a mixed outlook due to the economic slowdown, we'll chat shortly from Telsio, Inan Kriz. And the newest meme stock leader, Bed Bath Beyond, gets a new CEO, sort of, will have details. But first, over to Inez Faray, at the Wi-Fi Interactive. Inez? Yeah, Brian. And we're taking a look at new home sales for the month of September because we just got that data that came in. New home sales fell 10.9% to 603,000. That's an annualized rate. Now that did come in though higher than the expected that what economists had been expecting. Remember that in August, we saw a surprise to the upside for new home sales. September, though, was a month where you had the mortgage rates rising by more than 100 basis points. So that is expected to impact the slowing housing market. And why do we talk so much about the housing market? Well, because as housing goes, so does the economy. There are many jobs that are linked to the housing market. There are durable goods that are linked to this. Let's take a look at XHB. That is down 3 tens of a percent. But it had been down the home builder ETF. More than 1 percent before this data came out. But I just want to point out the year-to-date chart here. You can see the losses for the home improvement and home builders. Taking a look at where we're at with the sectors. We are seeing technology that is lower right now. We're also taking a look at consumer discretionary that's lower. And this has to do with big tech, which has been reporting, earnings started reporting, earnings yesterday with Microsoft and Google both down more than 7%. You've got meta, which will be reporting that's down 3%. And you've got Amazon down 4% guys. Yeah, finance is on a nest for a over there at the Wi-Fi Interactive. Thanks so much for tracking all that and that's appreciated. And everyone getting to some of those tech earnings that Annette's was mentioning. Let's give it off with Alphabet here. Missing Wall Street estimates for the third quarter as slow revenue growth and a dip in YouTube advertising. Wade on the search giant. But with its scale and diversified tech portfolio, is it positioned to weather disruption in the digital ad space? Joining us now to discuss and weigh in. We've got RBC capital markets, internet equity analysts Brad Erickson, pleasure to welcome another Brad into the chat here. So Brad, first and foremost, your takeaways from Alphabet here, especially considering some of the different parts of the business. I mean, this is still 7%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,5,2022-10-26 14:06:16
4125," on the Brad into the chat here. So Brad, first and foremost, your takeaways from alphabet here, especially considering some of the different parts of the business. I mean, this is still 79% in advertising based business here. Yeah, that's right. And I'll do my best. Brian, I got to tell you, I'm still reeling from how on Earth you spend $48 at Chipotle. But let's not Google since that's what I'm here for. Yeah, it was a tough quarter all around. They missed top and bottom line relative to the street. And then I think the Q4 commentary was particularly ominous. They spoke to seeing a basically broader pullback in ad spending within that business. And then surprisingly, there's no layoffs at Google. Apparently, they're actually adding employees half the rate that they have been. So it's a little bit slower. But I think that caught people by surprise as well. And so you're seeing earnings estimates in particular come down enormously here this morning. And obviously reflecting that in the stock. I want to ask about YouTube in particular. Is there something that Google can be doing out that can be doing with YouTube that it's not doing? Or is it just sort of subject to competition from TikTok, for example, plus the macro environment? And are there more levers that can pull there? Yeah, I mean, I think there's a couple of drivers, right? First and foremost, YouTube, because it is a social platform and does rely on third party measurement through IDFA, right? It was exposed to the Apple downturn. So there's absolutely been headwinds there. And I think they've somewhat abated from a year over year perspective, meaning we've lapped them. But I think there's probably still a bit of leakage going on there. And then sure, competitively, we all know TikToks over the last year, too, has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the room for those in the social space. And so one of the comments management made last night on the call was someone asked about whether the short form video that YouTube shorts increased usage if that was incremental to the YouTube or if it was a makeshift. And they kind of insinuated that it was a makeshift. And so that's your evidence that TikTok is continuing to have an effect on that business. Going forward, performance max is their product, which basically, if you don't know where to spend, be it search or YouTube or elsewhere, performance max is an AI tool that allocates your spend automatically. We do think that's going to be super important as they start layering spend into YouTube shorts. YouTube ad spend, I'm a monetization in YouTube shorts. But that's still early days. And so that's probably not going to show up in the numbers till next year. Brad, how severe do you think these cost cuts will be at alphabet? Well, to date, I mean, like I said earlier, we're not really seeing evidence, at least, directionally of cost cuts, right? Like they said, they're going to, from a net ad perspective for headcount, they're going to cut that in half. But that means they're still adding roughly 6,000 employees quarter of a quarter, which is a lot of heads. I think as we get through to next year, the CEO kind of reiterates some other comments previously around trying to squeeze out more efficiency on a per head count basis. So clearly they're pointing to more cost efficiencies there. But yeah, I think people are a little concerned that, hey, these guys are seeing a downturn. They're speaking to it qualitatively here going forward. And that's not being reflected in the cost base. Now, flip that. Maybe let's just take devil's advocate for a second and say that's positive. It could reinforce the view that maybe Google is just viewing this as a temporary transitory type of thing. A lot of confidence in the business longer term and they don't need to go there. So you could argue it both ways, but certainly for today and where margin estimates are going, it's a negative. And on the hardware side, it doesn't seem like they could even afford to lose out on an install base that they would see come in from the number of phone devices or smartphone or handheld devices, even with a waiting PC market, even with some of the slowdowns and add, it seems like they would need to continue to produce regardless of what the margins would look like on that side of the business. Yeah, I mean, hard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,6,2022-10-26 14:10:23
4126," It seems like they would need to continue to produce, regardless of what the margins would look like on that side of the business. Yeah, I mean, hardware is obviously a tertiary part of this model, but it certainly popped up, or flared up, I should say a little more in the core, with the launch of the Pixel 6A. Obviously that has a normal cost of billi-materials and gross margin profile for hardware product, which is substantially below the ad revenues. And so that weighed on the model to some degree in the quarter, but I don't expect that to be sort of a sustained headwind as we move forward here. So. RBC Capital Partners, Internet, Equity, Analyst, Brad, Ericsson, good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. You as well, thanks. All right, before we head to break, we have to check on shares of Bedbet to Beyond after the company announced, Sue Gove will soon the role of CEO after serving as interim CEO for four months. This comes in the middle of an attempt to turn around the brand following several quarters of slipping sales and really a very long period of operating losses. You see the stock down slightly today about 3%. Intel's mobile I spin off gets a disappointing IPO valuation Julie's back with today's top headlines next. Thanks for opportunity. Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Intel is set to debut its self-driving unit Mobileye at $21 to share during its anticipated IPO, this according to the Wall Street Journal. Now, price represents a premium. From its expected range, the unit, which focuses on driver assisting and self-driving technologies like sensors and microchips, comes both as driving aids become increasingly critical to portfolios of automakers. And as the market for public debut continues facing a dry spell, I should say it's above the range that was reported or is originally being below the initial range. So I guess it's somewhere in the middle. The shape of the shape continues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,7,2022-10-26 14:15:00
4127," A dry spell, I should say, it's above the range that was reported or is originally being below the initial range. So I guess it's somewhere in the middle. The shape of the shake-up continues at Warner Brothers Discovery. The media empire announcing that James Gunn and Peter Safren will be the new co-heads of DC Comics, which oversees iconic properties like the Batman and Justice League franchises. This after reports that the company had taken a write-off of up to $4.3 billion on canceling projects like CNN Plus, and that girl, as well as layoffs, across the WBD company. And an Apple executive has confirmed for the first time that the company will comply with the EU's mandate for mobile devices to use USBC during a tech event. The EU standard was enacted to help consumers simplify charging and cut down on e-waste. Apple senior vice president marketing didn't give away any more details on the commitment. But said the company would have approached the problem differently, the company had previously remained mum about whether it would honor EU regulations over the charging standard. Apple first introduced a lightning port in its iPhone 5. It's not officially hinted at what might place that port. Sauce? All right, let's check back in now on the broader markets as the Fed juggles the balancing act of Kermit inflation and a verdict, a recession. Where does that leave investors seeking to balance the two risks for more on this? We have BlackRock's Tony Disparito. Tony, good to always get some time with you. I think let's start on the today's market action because I think what we're seeing is pretty interesting, you know, Julie highlighted earlier on the show. Some pretty not good quarters from Microsoft and Google, yet stocks are hanging in there. Are we watching the bottoming process in markets take place? Yeah, so I think look, there's some short-term and long-term drivers here. And certainly if you kind of look year-to-date, you know, the market has gone down dramatically and all of it has been multiple contraction, right? We've gone through a multiple that was 22 at the beginning of the year to about 16, 17 today. Meanwhile, earnings have mostly picked up, although they're starting to roll over. And the market's dealing with the risk of a recession. So from my perspective, I like the valuation. I think the valuations have come back down to the normal range. I'm still concerned about earnings, and that's what we're seeing is a bumpy ride with respect to earnings. And I see more volatility in the short run because if you think about the Fed, the Fed just started hiking in March of this year, seven months ago. And that was a 25 basis point hike, by the way. And when you think about Fed interaction with the economy, those rate hikes typically take at least six months to have any impact. And the full impacts felt more like 18 months down the road. So we still haven't felt the full impacts of those rate increases. That's going to impact economics. That's going to impact earnings. And so I still see some bumpy ride ahead. And I think what investors should do is prepare their portfolios to be more resilient. All right. So within that bumpy ride, who is sitting on the wheel or who's sitting in perhaps the most insulated part of the bus as we're continuing to watch the Fed and for their mandate, them trying to meet some of those benchmark expectations. For some sectors, they're going to experience this a little bit harder than others as we've seen both pullbacks and consumer discretionary real estate's been hit hard. And then additionally, you mentioned tech a moment ago. Yeah. So I think an active manager can really add value here, both through industry sector as well as stock selection. And I kind of look at the world in terms of sickle goals and more stable learners. I think there's value to be added on both sides in terms of sickle goals in the fund eye run. We're really favoring energy and financials as they both benefit from the inflationary impulse. Certainly energy. That's a long history there. And then on financials, you have the benefit of rising short-term rates, expanding net interest margin. And then on the more stable side, I'm really in favor of health care. Health care is certainly as stable as utilities and staples historically from an earnings perspective. Yet has a better long-term growth dynamic in the valuations today are significantly more compelling. And so that's how I see the opportunity to add value for investors. What about a place like technology? And if you talk about stable earnings, I mean, even though it's slowing the earnings growth from many of the companies that we heard from late yesterday, it's so relatively stable. So I wonder how you're thinking about that group. So I do think that they're real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,8,2022-10-26 14:19:03
4128," the case that we heard from late yesterday, it's so relatively stable. So I wonder how you're thinking about that group. So I do think that there are real pockets of technology where there's real good opportunity. And I'd even put it in that stable bucket, kind of a new staple, if you will. And that just because there's a recession, it doesn't mean you can slow down on your text back. Right, and so we're still seeing cloud grow. It's growing a little bit more slowly than maybe it has historically. But it's still growing by leaps and bounds, 40% plus in the quarter as we look at recent reports. And so I do see really clean balance sheets and technology. So these are things we're emphasizing. The clean balance sheets, the companies that have more stable like earnings. And then you've got to be, look at evaluations. Make sure you're not overpaying for that collection of good business with good earnings power. Tony, you mentioned energy in that sector. We've already seen this have composed some of the best performers year to date. So is that trade already missed? I don't think so. And for a couple of reasons, there is a long term supply demand mismatch there. And the mismatch is really coming from restrained supply. That sector went into, I'll call it a recession back in 2014 where there was significant excess capacity. And since then, you've seen CAPEX come down dramatically and stay down. And that's really important. And so when you look at companies today, even with high oil prices, you're not getting that supply response. And in fact, you're seeing good discipline out of OPEC, they just cut and saying, look, the economy is slowing. We need to cut supply. And then also when you look at the strategic petroleum reserve, we've been releasing about a million barrels a day. That's 1% of demand. Doesn't sound like a lot. But in the market like oil, that's normally very steady. 1% means a lot. And so we're about done with those releases come December. And so that's going to be another thing that's going to put a floor under price. Tony, I appreciate the time here today. BlackRock, Tony Disparito joining us this morning. Thanks so much.

4129," export Microsoft beat on the top end bottom lines yesterday, but the company's guidance fell short after the company reported software than expected cloud revenue. CEO, Satsun Nadella, says that cynical trends are weighing or cyclical trends are weighing on the stock's consumer business, but could the company's plan to moderate expenses boost its stock joining us now to weigh in? It's probably percent. There's Internet equity analyst Brent Braseland. Brent, great to have you here with us this morning. For Microsoft, some of the larger headwinds that they had laid out, FX, PC, which of these do you see actually being able to abate in the near term of all of the headwinds that they mentioned? How can Microsoft successfully navigate this period? Sure you bet. Clearly, you're starting to see the macro pressure start to erode into the growth outlook for Microsoft. If you look at the cloud business, it's actually still pretty healthy, slowing, but we still expect the cloud business to grow north of 20 percent this year, a little slower than we thought originally six months ago. It's really the more economically sensitive parts of Microsoft. That's still a big business. That's still a $100 billion business. It has been growing across windows and PCs and surface devices and gaming. That's a $100 billion plus business that has been growing 4 percent plus for the last two, three years. It could actually decline double digits this next quarter. It's really where we're seeing that the slow down in those more cyclically sensitive areas, more of the consumer areas, the commercial still holding up pretty well. That's sort of in line with what we've been hearing from the commentary we've been getting ahead of the earnings season from the likes of a sales force, for example, that have seemed to indicate that business spending is holding up pretty well, but how long does that last? If the cyclical stuff is rolling over, can we expect it at some point to also affect the more enterprise spending? Absolutely. And you're just now starting to see small cracks in the cloud growth rate. If you look at Azure, it's one of the fastest growing parts of the cloud business for Microsoft. That growth profile is decelled by about 9 percentage points in about three quarters. So you absolutely are seeing slow down. It's still good growth, right? 37% in constant currencies with the guided to this coming quarter. That's down from 47% over the last couple of years. So it's slowing. We're seeing signs of maybe some budgetary pressure on the enterprise side. That's going to flow through into next year as well. So we certainly wouldn't say enterprise software cloud is immune to the macro. And we're now starting to see cracks. Brent, clearly a challenging quarter for Microsoft outside of your coverage universe or outside of Microsoft. Are there other companies that you think will be impacted to the same extent as Microsoft? Sure. We actually took numbers down on 22 stocks last week, including cutting numbers by Microsoft by 3 billion. Clearly wasn't enough. We took another $7 billion cut to our Microsoft numbers this morning. But yeah, we think there really isn't a safe haven in software. I think the macro pressures will eventually impact growth rates for most of the enterprise software names that we cover. So I think the good news is valuation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,10,2022-10-26 14:27:42
4130," and surely impact growth rates for most of the enterprise software names that we cover. So, you know, I think the good news is valuations are started at bottom. So I think there's no longer a valuation risk. The challenge fundamentals have not bottomed yet. So we still have a bottoming process to go through on the fundamental side. We need to see growth expectations for next year reset. And we're getting close, but certainly have to go through a fundamental trough before you start to see stabilization. What type of growth profile would you give at this point to Microsoft's cloud business, considering the pull forward and demand that we'd seen over the past couple years? Yes, so it's interesting. We look at the broader cloud market. The cloud 100, if you will, growth was 33% in 2021. We're modeling about 22% cloud industry growth in 2022. That's similar to where Microsoft Cloud is at. Next year, we're actually sub 20% growth for industry, about 19.5% industry cloud industry growth expectations. That's essentially, I think, directionally where Microsoft's headed as well. High teens growth in a recessionary environment seems like a good, kind of landing spot for this industry. That's down from 33. So that is a material slowed down, but still really good growth for an industry that could be north of $300 billion in 2023. With valuations sitting where they are right now, do you think that Microsoft, especially within this cloud landscape, needs to make a key acquisition and strike while the opportunity might be there to go after a company that could help it grow out of its portfolio in the cloud a little bit better? Listen, Microsoft's still the cloud king. It's the only cloud company north of $100 billion in revenue. It's still growing, poised to grow 20% in consequences. So could they do more? Absolutely. Should they do more? Absolutely. Do I think they will do more? Absolutely. So $17 billion in cash, $65 billion in cash flow. Microsoft's not done from an M&A standpoint in cloud. We expect them to be active next year. Absolutely. Times three. Thanks so much, Brandon. Appreciate it, Brent Braseland, a FIPER-SANDLER equity research. Appreciate it. Coming up next, we'll get a pulse check on the state of telecom with AT&T Executive, Jen Robertson. Don't want to miss it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,11,2022-10-26 14:32:13
4131," Cause you never know when started to get your lifeง Jan. Team up, good news. You'll get that in a second. Raymond James, the most recent analyst o'plod, 18 T's recent quarter. Take your simple T with a boost to strong buy from Al perform this after the US telecom reported its third quarter numbers last week, including a net gain of 708,000 pre paid subscribers joining us to talk about the company and economic environment is Jen Robertson, AT&T, mass markets, executive vice president and general manager. Jen, thanks for being here. Thank you. So as we look at these subscriber numbers, what I'm curious about is where they are coming from. In other words, are they coming from your competitors, which competitors and what is it costing you in terms of promotions? Yeah, we're really proud of the subscriber growth we've been delivering and we're sitting at nine quarters now in a row of 600,000 post paid voice net ads or more and delivering near record levels. So it's been an exciting time to be in the industry, proud of how we're standing up against competitors, 2.000,000 net ads year to date through the third quarter and expecting that to be an industry leading position as we move forward. So holding strong there and certainly delivering that from a higher demand for connectivity, it is a resilient product and looking at customers and delivering value. And so yes, there are promotional offers, but we are meeting customers where they want to be. We have distribution expansion that's occurred. We're meeting customers where they want to shop. A lot of trends that came out of the COVID pandemic that have carried forward and changed how people want to interact with us and we're proud of how we've simplified our product and pricing construct and met customers where they want to be. When you think about the advancements in the network too, one thing that we've heard over the course of this earnings season from telecommunications and communication services companies is where those investments are being made and boosting up the network. Where, how soon do you see that beginning to really play out for so many of the customers that you're serving too? Right. So we've made investments, significant investments in the 5G wireless network, proud to be moving towards 130 million subscribers and customers that will be covered with our CBAN spectrum by the end of this year, 200 million and more covered by 5G. And certainly the country's largest investor in fiber. And so putting those investments there because it's the connectivity that customers want, it is the technology that will meet the next decade plus of demand for customers both on usage and on speed. And so that's why you see us really doubling down and putting our focus in those two network technologies. It was talked a lot about the earnings call Jen, just improved value perception. So what are you doing specifically on pricing? You're cutting prices of plans, you have any more plans to drop them even further. I think actually we raised prices earlier this year on our legacy plans. And what I am really proud of the team for doing was taking a customer-centered approach to it. We looked at what customers wanted and candidly they want simple plans, they want choice and they want to get more value. And so even as we raised prices in some areas, we had customers choose to move to our newer unlimited plans and upgrade their service and pay a higher price point because they saw the value exchange that was included in there. We allow customers to mix and match plans in our unlimited your way offerings. We allow customers to write size it for their household. We allow customers to have 5G included. So certainly a value to a customer where they even-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,12,2022-10-26 14:36:35
4132," So they can write size it for their household. We allow customers to have 5G included. So certainly a value to a customer where they felt, yes, I'm getting something for this exchange. I think people are still trying to figure out what 5G is and does for them, right? We've been talking about it for a couple of years now. Full disclosure, we were owned by a phone company. We've rivaled phone company before. We heard a lot about 5G. Like if I have 5G on my phone, is there a noticeable difference in how that phone is performing for me? We absolutely, as we deploy our CBAN spectrum, there is an absolute difference in speed and higher speeds that customers can experience. I think it's interesting. 4G technology had such a leapfrog in the use cases for customers that as 5G came out, I think our media cycle was earlier on the 5G hype and consumers and businesses looking at, okay, now how do I get the use cases out more quickly? And we forget that we're still in the process of deploying the network. There are certainly business use cases that are coming to life, manufacturing, health care. A lot of opportunity there is UCS lean in, connected car being one. From the everyday consumer right now, it is absolutely a speed increase. Let's just say, I use a competitor service from my phone full and fair disclosure and 5G for me doesn't pop up everywhere. What is it like on your service? Do you still see dead spots for 5G? Yeah, I think it comes back to we deploy the spectrum in phases and that takes time. And so you'll see 130 million people covered by the end of this year with our 5G CBAN, where you'll have a noticeable speed. You know, just lastly what we have here, we think about the areas of the economy that have like these little luxuries that consumers will continue to buy in, even during an economic downturn, is your phone service, your cellular service, is that a little luxury that you're seeing people continue to spend higher for just because of all the different things that we use our devices for on a daily basis right now too? Right, I think what we see it is not a luxury, it's a requirement. Customers need connectivity for personal use, for business use, for learning and commerce. And so it's actually a very resilient product. And customers are purchasing up, it's why our RPU was up in the third quarter. All right, let's see what they are, Jen Robertson, AT&T, Mass, Markets, EVP and General Manager. Good to see you, thanks for coming to our studio. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right, coming up, we'll chat with Mattel, Celia, and not cries as the toy maker gears up for the peak holiday shopping season. We'll be right back. Good looking mess around up here and we've come back. Good looking mess around. Good looking. Right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,13,2022-10-26 14:40:51
4133," metallic Tienbok Party Shares of Mattel aren't focused after the toy maker trimmed its full year guidance in its third quarter earnings report last night saying market volatility and other macroeconomic risks has forced it to reformulate its expectations. Patel Chairman and CEO Anon Krauss joins us now to discuss. No, I know he's great to get some time with you. Your top takeaway on the quarter. Thank you, Brian, for inviting me. Well, this was a good quarter for Mattel. The ninth straight quarter of year of year growth in constant currency. Look, as you know, we are in the midst of a challenging economic environment, but our year-to-date results of double-digit growth in net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS, showed that we are successfully navigating a complex landscape and our strategy is working. We believe our fundamentals are strong and we are very confident about our multi-year growth trajectory. Anon, I've been covering you and the turnaround story Mattel for a good bit now. I wasn't used to that tone on that conference call last night just highlighting some slowing you're seeing in the market. How severe is that gun? Look, there's no, it's not a secret that the economy, the broader economy, is currently challenging. But our year-to-date result do show and do demonstrate that we are on the right track. We are maintaining guidance for full-year growth in net sales in constant currency of 8 to 10 percent and look forward to the holiday season. We modestly revised our profit expectation to allow and accommodate for the inflation that we're seeing, but we still expect a growth year for Mattel, both at the top line and the bottom line and also expect 2023 to be a growth year, both top line and bottom line. So we are very confident about our trajectory. Brands are resonating, thriving with the continued engagement and cultural impact and we're very confident about our strategy and execution. You did highlight the need that there might be a little more promotions in the holiday quarter than I think a lot of investors may be expected. How much discounting do you expect to be doing? According to date, consumer demand is a non-with expectation and we're pleased with our performance. Shoppers are returning to traditional purchasing patterns closer to the holiday and we expect demand to accelerate. We are working closely with our retail partners to meet the anticipated demand. We have more advertising and promotion. We secured more shelf space and retail of support compared to last year and we also expect to and also we have great holiday toilies representation and much stronger in stock. So yes, we are going to increase promotion and activity, but we are well positioned for the fourth quarter in the holiday season, which is why we are maintaining a full year guidance of net sales growth in 8% to 10% in constant currency. No, I'm old. I'm not as close as I used to be. What are some of the top toilies in the holiday season? Well, Mansahai is going to be a very exciting offering as we prepare for the global launch next year. Hot Wheels Car Wash, Lightyear products, Fisher Price has a great musical toy called Bouncing Beats and the Dreamhouse. Of course, we will always be on the top of the toilies for every holiday season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,14,2022-10-26 14:45:04
4134," I saw some great musical toy called bouncing beats and the dream house, of course, will always be on the top of the toilet for every holiday season. So an exciting, broad offering across a pretty large spectrum of product that we're very excited about. I remember having one of those car washes as a kid, and I got to send your photo exists somewhere, but these are some cool toys. That is an interesting stuff. And how is the pricing on these compared to last year? Do you plan to take more pricing? Look, we increased pricing in the second half of this year. We were able to successfully implement those increases and it's too early to tell, but so far, we haven't seen a meaningful impact on consumer demand. Important to say that as it relates to inflation, we are beginning to see some improvement in the course of ocean freight and materials. We expect inflation to moderate in 2023. And in addition to the savings that we're looking to generate of $250 million by the end of 2023, we expect the combination of pricing and cost savings to more than offset cost inflation and contribute to margin expansion over time. So we are proactively managing our business in this environment to ensure that we are set up for long-term success. You may be the first CEO that we've talked to to really highlight a peak in inflation and things cooling off a bit. I certainly, certainly that is good to hear in a different tone. Let's go on to Barbie because Barbie's been an interesting story the past year or two here. Real growth mechanism for the company. What's on tap for that brand next year? Oh, very confident about the long-term growth trajectory of Barbie. Barbie was the number one global dollar property in the third quarter and year to date. Year to date, Barbie is up, which is an excellent achievement when compared to last year, which was the highest on record for Barbie of all times. We look forward to next year, which will have an exciting innovation pipeline, new content slate with Netflix. And of course, the highly anticipated Barbie movie, our first theatrical release that will come out this summer. Also important to know that Barbie doubled in size over the past five years and was the number one global toy property overall, not just in dollars, but overall in the last two years. And we really see that as a proof point to the strength of this incredible franchise, very confident about Barbie and proud to have it as our leading franchise. It does seem like a nine. And we've talked about this in the past. You've all the seeds that you have plans in terms of content. And of course, you highlight the Barbie movie or now coming to fruition. This will start to hit the market next year and beyond. How much will you spend on content next year? Well, we employ a capital-wide strategy. We are not spending money on content. We are leveraging our brands. We collaborate with the best filmmakers and content creators out there, both not just film, but also in television. And partly with major studios to create, produce, distribute and commercialize our brands on the big screen and also in episodic content. We have a very exciting slate of 14 additional movies other than Barbie that we currently developing with some of the best and most prolific creators of this generation. And this is going to grow up because we have more in the pipeline that we haven't announced. And likewise, Mattel television is thriving with 12 series and specials that will be on air this year, so to speak, because some are actually by streaming. Eight of those are new for a returning. Months-to-high-love action television movie musical, just launch an ecology and we grinlit the second movie. And we continue to roll out more content, such as Thomas and friends, polypocket, fireman Sam, DeepAnerNoop, more Barbie product, Piccenaerie Game Show, and the list goes on and on. So exciting to see how our brands resonate with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,15,2022-10-26 14:49:19
4135," and a new, more Bobby product, a dictionary game show, and the list goes on and on. So, exciting to see how our brands resonate with consumers and attract creators to collaborate with us, because like us, they're also very excited to reimagine and create an expression of our product in content. Once the Pokemon movie hitting it on, well, we licensed recently the Pokemon brand, which is one of the strongest franchises this year for mega, for building sets. It's been a great driver for us, and we're very proud to work with the Pokemon company in expressing their IP in combination without product. So, it's a great partnership. And this really speaks to how we elevate to become the partner of choice for the major entertainment companies, and where we bring our capabilities, our global scale, our innovation, our supply chain, and commercial capabilities collaborate with other owners, other franchises, and take them to the next level, and create evergreen franchises, just like we do with our own. And I'm just being flagged before I let you go. And there was just a new Pokemon movie, Detective Pikachu. That's how you know you're getting old, but you do not realize those types of movies are in the market. We'll leave it there for now. Good luck this holiday season. Mattelcio and I'm cries. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you so much. All right, coming up, we'll zero in on some more key earnings reports from Visa, Haliburne, and Skechers. Looking forward to sharing that now. So that's next. Gosh. Welcome back everyone, it is time for Cup for Time. We've got four stories today. One minute each. Hello with this, Visa the tracking tick or symbol GO on the day of days.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,16,2022-10-26 14:53:59
4136," Welcome back everyone. It's time for Cup for Time. We've got four stories today. One minute each we're going to start with this visa tracking ticker symbol V on the day. It's up by about 5.6 percent right now. This is after beating on Q3 earnings. The payment company says it still sees strong consumer spending. Payments volume. That grew 10 percent in the quarter while transactions grew 12 percent. And this comes back to the type of spending that consumers are more prone to do at this point of time leaning towards some of the card products and card services out there versus just saying yeah I'll pay with cash. They're trying to hold on to some of that cash. Yeah and all this travel that we're talking about right how are people paying for that they're you know they're putting it on their card. So again this this speaks the idea that we're not seeing and across the board everything's slowing down at once right. It is very uneven here and visa's results I think are a good example of that. American Express good quarter last week visa could quarter I'm not depressed. Well and on the travel front as you mentioned American Express had cited global travel or corporate travel especially given that American Express has so much of the corporate T&E that they kind of account for within that landscape but for visa that clearly playing out for them too. Yeah all right Halliburne so earnings double in the last quarter as demand for crude oil increases leading to an upgrade from most Fargo take which is sending shares higher the bank upgrade the stock from underweight to overweight so pretty simple analysis here oil prices up good quarter for Halliburne. Yeah although it's not always as straightforward as that right you need the demand for oil services as well and not just the increase in oil prices I mean the price chart get jump on coming from Roger Readover Wells Fargo is pretty impressive to $52 from $33 so he's looking for a lot more upside. So are a lot of investors we speak to right we just talked to Tony Despirodo over at BlackRock he mentioned energy as an area that he likes right now and he's not the only one even after the climb that we saw in energy stocks especially in the first half of the year. Yeah I mean it's really a story as well though within all of this up pricing they're pricing increased in North America and international markets they're saying that the strength of their strategy and action was really kind of resulting in this revenue growth of 6% sequentially there and really led by some of that pricing and the macro environment right now too. On the other end of the spectrum we have sketchers the footwear manufacturer seeing shares dipping today after missing third quarter estimates give a down be outlook for the current quarter the shares up 4.5% and I'm seeing the love analyst concerned being expressed over the margins and the target for margins as well for sketchers so again here illustrating the lumpiness in consumer spending right people maybe you're traveling maybe people are buying some shoes still but they're not buying as many sketches and it's costing the company more to get them out there and maybe to move them out the door too. Inventory up 21% right flag but it still comes back to the core consumer that sketchers is going to go after here we've seen them move more into some of this sport or leisure activity category they've got a number of PGA tour some now live golfers I believe that are still on the roster and so with that it's this larger question of when you've got a millennial and Gen Z population that have clearly shown what their brand of entities are Nike, Lulele lemon and then additionally crocs as well as one of the kind of growth areas that we've seen in some of the more kind of comfortable shoes where to sketch your sit within that too I think that's a larger question that the brand is still going to have to answer for. All right now we're looking at wingstop shares a wingstop taking flight today after the fast food chain announced prices of bone and chicken wings are actually decreasing the falling prices prompted wingstop to raise its full year gone and so this is what we've heard for wingstop in recent quarters deflation and chicken wing prices really one of the only fast food companies that I can think of actually seeing deflation in parts of their business wingstop benefiting from that. They just got into the chicken sandwich game madly that's the analysis. Well they may be seeing deflation in chicken wings but they're probably not seeing deflation in labor costs right I mean that's something I think that is still we're seeing upward pressure on that across the board for anybody within the food business specifically because people still don't want to come back and work in that business. No it's true and at the same time where wingstop is also still trying to navigate with that direct correlation or that direct touch point with the consumer is while many of those consumers have options on the table.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,17,2022-10-26 14:58:00
4137," At the same time where Wingstop is also still trying to navigate with that direct correlation or that direct touch point with the consumer is, while many of those consumers have options on the table to get delivery through some of the other third-party sources as well for their chicken wings. However, falling chicken prices help them that out. All right. We are seeing a stock sound mix right now and coming up at Kiko Vegeta, we'll continue our coverage of earnings from Tech giants out of that Microsoft with technologists research president Bob O'Donnell. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Big misses for big tech, the results season serves up some uncomfortable questions for the global economy underwhelming reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Texas Instruments all wing on sentiment this morning. Too strong for too long. The greenback, the dominant currency for most of 2022, but a broad move against the dollar takes place in global FX. So the question here, are we at peak hawkishness? We're going to ask global ETFs Morgan Del Done later in the show. And in this economy, Intel's mobile I price is its long-awaited IPO above the targeted range. Could stripe an Instacart B-next. We're going to get into that conversation later this hour. So as always, we are checking the markets right now. 90 minutes into the trading day right now. 10 minute to go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,18,2022-10-26 15:02:39
4138," It's Stripe and Instacart V-Nex. We're going to get into that conversation later this hour. First though, as always, we are checking the markets right now. 90 minutes into the trading day right now. The Dow is up about 240 points. The Nasdaq, the big one we're keeping a close watch on on the back of those big tech reports. Of course, we're going to be breaking down Microsoft as well as Alphabet, meta on tap after the belt today. One we're going to be watching closely. Taking a look at where the bond markets are right now. We have seen a bit of a pullback here, but the shorter end still well above that 4% level, five year at 4.2, and the benchmark 10 year just right about at 4%. Well, shares of Alphabet are sliding into the red after missing estimates on the top and bottom lines. The tech giant's revenue growth slowed to 6% from 41%. The prior year is at spending continues its downward trend. Lapping from a strong third quarter last year, for some tough comps across Alphabet's portfolio, including search and YouTube. Take a listen to what we heard from Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat on the earnings call. And YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in the third quarter, versus the second quarter, primarily reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spend. In the fourth quarter, the very strong revenue performance last year will continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues. Joining us to break this all down. We've got Bob O'Donnell, Technologist Research at President Chief Analyst for more on-the-impact top companies. We're starting to feel from an economic slowdown. Bob, we've got you in the flesh. I'd so great to be back alive in the studio. It's crazy. Certainly a good day to break this all down. We're going to start with Alphabet because we were saying before the show that it's interesting to see how significantly they were affected, especially in digital ads. When you think about the last quarter, there's a bit of a divergence between the social media companies. Alphabet has a bit more of a diversified portfolio, but they weren't shielded this time around. No, I mean, because obviously Alphabet gets searched and we're always going to search and people are always going to do that. And so they always have that that they can fall back on as part of the advertising side. But the social media side and the YouTube side of things, that's where they took the hit and that's because we're seeing, obviously, overall advertising going down in those places. And the other challenge that you've got with Alphabet is it's not really that diversified a company, right? There's so much dependence upon advertising. I mean, look, they do have Google Cloud, which they didn't really talk too much about that, but they have a few things that are bubbling up, but they're still small. I mean, I saw the other day that other bets, remember, when they used to talk about other bets, it's 0.3% of the company's revenue. So I mean, I think that's one of the ongoing challenges. They're going to favor these things out. They are building their business not only on the enterprise side. I should say not only for Google Cloud, but also Google Workspace, some of their other services where they compete with Microsoft. And that's been growing and that continues to grow. It's going to take a while before it becomes a huge contributor to the bottom line, but there are these elements that are in play and that are moving forward for them. What was your takeaway, though, from what we heard in terms of where things are headed? And it seemed like they were sort of setting things up for an even more significant downturn. And to your point, yes, it's not as diversified as a company like Microsoft, but in terms of where the ad revenue and where they compete in, it is a little more diversified than the likes of Meta or stuff. Yes, no, it definitely is. And look, I think what we're seeing in a lot of ways across tech is a sense of the things that people expected to happen at the beginning of the pandemic didn't and now they kind of are. It's sort of like it's a two and a half year delay of the big impact that people thought was going to have. I think in general, we're seeing that tech companies having weathered so well are now facing the challenges that other parts of the market have faced. And it's just that's the reality. Growth is going to slow down. And on the advertising side, of course, that's a reflection of overall macroeconomic trends. And there's not a whole lot they can do about that. And I think that's a challenge. Obviously, there's not many more places they can go. I mean, Google is everywhere and there's stuff is everywhere. So it's really going to be dependent upon how the general macroeconomic does so that those companies then feel more confident.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,19,2022-10-26 15:06:44
4139, order places they can go i mean google is everywhere and their stuff is everywhere so it's really going to be dependent upon how the general macroeconomic does so that those companies and feel more confident there are advertising i should say feel more confident in spending the money with uh... a platform like google let's talk about microsoft obviously as your spend the big growth driver there and you have said in your notes that because it is more enterprise state of facing they are a little more shielded and yet what we heard yesterday i think it was on the call from google saying essentially yes companies are still investing in the cloud but they're taking a little longer and maybe thinking a little hard about how much they want to invest so are we likely to see further headwinds for microsoft even if as your the driver i think we will and you know the issue is it's easy forget that only about i i think the numbers last number of her group fifteen to twenty percent of companies have moved their workloads to the cloud or i shouldn't say of companies of of the potential workloads and so there's still this huge potential upside to move to cloud computing from all the big platforms and the other thing to bear in mind is we've had these incredibly strong growth rates for cloud computing across the board you know a w s obviously microsoft and at some point that's it can't last right it's the law of big numbers you run into a certain point where it's it's very difficult the thing is even as things start to slow down a bit a lot of companies started big initiatives during the pandemic that are cloud computing based and they are going to continue those like you said in as the commentary said some of those projects are going to slow down a little bit they're not quite as high priority perhaps as they were but they're still going to do it because it's still part of these companies really kind of trying to transform their businesses and that's an essential part of survival you know in the next decade we're still waiting on numbers from meta we've got alphabet or amazon and apple later on in the week you know it's sort of interesting to see how the narrative around tech has changed because for a while it was about the social media companies and yet when you think it where we are in the current court it feels like we're going back to sort of these established players if we can call that it is come down to apple it comes down to microsoft and how are you looking at your portfolio of those tech names and where are the safe bets yeah no i mean i think we are falling back to the most trusted tech brands and the big names are going to be the ones that are going to i think well you know make it through this the other thing is again these companies over the years have become increasingly diverse diversified now in the case of meta i think it's a challenge right obviously very advertising focused uh... very consumer based advertising focus so likely it's going to be tough you know apple everybody loves to say well one of these days something's going to catch up to apple but what apple magically manages to do every quarter is somehow get different elements of the puzzle to add together there have been rumblings that iphone 14 sales for example have been lower than expected so they've you know apparently cut the production and so people say i will see iphone is going to be down but remember now that iphone is less than 50% of the revenue they've built up this huge install base they continue to sell services right everything from apple tv and all the other services they have that's driving their growth they're also doing more obviously with airpods and the watch and other elements of their ecosystem so they've managed to create this you know i think pretty diverse story similar to amazon right i mean amazon is you know very dichotomy you've got a w s which just cranks out revenue and cranks out uh... you know dollars and then you've got the online sales business which realistically is probably going to you know take a hit if it's going to be like any the other retail environments but the question is is there enough on the you know a w s i'd offset some of that i it's it's hard to tell for sure but again it's that story of diversification that these big tech companies have done over the years and i think we're going to start to see the benefits of that but clearly at more of a reduced kind of a normal rate yeah not the huge uh... multiples that they've gotten yeah a lot of investors are going to be parsing those numbers are breaking down those numbers closely uh... but great to have you in studio so i think you can go great to be here Bobo Donald technologist research president and chief analyst well macro headwinds no doubt taking a toll on corporate results we've been talking about an underwhelming numbers for big tech pointing out some glaring weaknesses in the global economy major data points held above water for some time but is a slow down we've been fearing so long finally here,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,20,2022-10-26 15:11:02
4140," Some glaring weaknesses in the global economy. Major data points held above water for some time, but it's a slowdown we've been fearing so long, finally here. We've got an S for A and Julie Hyman. Julie, making an appearance on the other side of the show. Let's start with the earnings because we just went through the big tech ones there, but there's another one that I know in as you've been watching, and that's Texas Instruments. Yeah, that's right. And Texas Instruments is important because their chips go into everything from home appliances to missiles. So the scope of where their chips go is very significant here. And Texas Instruments basically saying that they are seeing softness, especially also going into the industrial segment. So that industrial segment that seemed to be immune to sort of a softness in the chip space, a slowdown in chip space, that is notable. Now, analysts have been talking about that we would see a slowdown in the chip space, especially in the second half of the year. But again, that scope, you also have, of course, the Biden administration restrictions when it comes to chips and China that's also weighing on here. But the bottom line from what I can glean from this is that basically this slowdown that we're seeing, it's not going to be a quick turnaround. Julie, your thoughts on that? Well, it's interesting what's going on with Texas Instruments. It seems like everything's slowed except autos. It's what analysts were pointing out. That was actually a bright spot because that's a spot where the automakers are sort of in an arms race where that is concerned. So for me, the takeaway is that this is very lumpy. And this is something we were talking about in the last hour, not just within chips, but within everything, right? Because if you look at results from something like visa, which was out with its numbers as well, from there, the indication seemed to be that consumer spending is still relatively strong on things like, perhaps, travel, right? So it's not that businesses and consumers are not spending. It's that the spending is on different things. They're spending, perhaps, less, maybe overall. Certainly, companies seem to be judging by the results from Microsoft, for example. But it's not sort of across the board, things falling off a clip. It's this sort of lumpy slowdown. But doesn't that go back to sort of like, how do we look at what the macro picture looks like? I mean, we've been talking so much about how there's this divergence between where consumer sentiment is, versus where consumers are actually spending, and that it, yes, there are concerns about higher prices, and yet when you look at the broader labor market, things are still pretty tight. And this sort of seems to add to that idea of it being a little noisy and trying not being able to have a very clear picture on where things are headed. Yeah, definitely. And if you also look at the home data, for example, I've been also watching that because as housing goes, so does the economy. This is another area where we are seeing September, New Home Sales were down in September, and you saw also in September the mortgage rates, those climbed up to, by 100 basis points. That's huge amount in one month. So now it's just sitting just around 7%. You are going to see a slowdown in this, in the housing market, we are already seeing it, and keep in mind the housing is a lagging indicator. So when we're talking about these different areas of the consumer, how the consumer feels, where it's spending its money, housing is a huge component of the economy. It encompasses so many jobs from construction to mortgage lending, and then it also encompasses the durable goods. So, diswashers, everything that has to do with building a home and what you put inside the home. I think that there's different areas, as you mentioned, of the economy. It is a little bit lumpy, and it's just, which areas do you want to focus on, and which are lagging, which are the ones that indicate? Well, in going back to what we've been learning from earnings, when Chipotle is kind of an interesting story, they raise prices a lot of companies have to offset the cost. They did beat expectations, and yet it does seem to suggest that there are trade-offs that are happening among consumers. Well, and they talked about that the lower income consumers are not coming in as often. Transactions actually fell at Chipotle by a percent. They're going to fall by a higher percentage in the current quarter, according to the CFO Jack Carton, who we spoke earlier today. And so not only are you getting lumpiness among what consumers are spending on, there's a lot of differentiation amongst consumers. So whereas a higher-end consumer might still go out and spend a house, even though a buy house, maybe they're spending less on that house. Likewise, you're going to have a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,21,2022-10-26 15:15:26
4141," Shows amongst consumers. So whereas a higher end consumer might still go out and spend a house even though a buy house Maybe they're spending less on that house Likewise, you're gonna have a big differentiation between higher and lower end consumers and what they're buying where they're Traveling etc. Well, I mean even that if even if you know, so lower income Customers aren't coming through the doors much higher income maybe spending more bit even for higher income That is a trade down right? Yeah, it could be definitely if they're buying chipotle and not capital grill I don't know you know, like I don't know where they live I'm right exactly, but yes, there could be some decisions being made and we know that inflation impacts the lower and The lower income consumer as well. So that is expected These are I mean we've seen it with other with even the the dollar stores in the previous earnings where they they show where consumers are spending and they're maybe not spending on the t-shirts There's now spending on food on on the consumable products. Yeah, something we've heard from other retailers to groceries over other purchases Good to have both of you on next in that's for Angelie Heimann Well coming up I on the prize of Fedhockishness is peaking does that mean the IPO market can get back to its feet Intel's plans for its autonomous driving unit should help boost sentiment that discussions on the other side You You You Well Balancing act Elon must deal to buy Twitter slated to close this Friday Bloomberg reporting that the Tesla CEO Confirmed that in a video conference with bankers funding the deal The timing though making some people nervous with less than two weeks to go until the midterms There are growing concerns about social media companies and how well they're equipped to handle disinformation and Content manipulation. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan who's following that story for us into number one We're looking at this timing potentially a little clearer if",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,22,2022-10-26 15:19:42
4142," and content manipulation. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, is Alexis Keenan, who's following that story for us. And to number one, we're looking at this timing, potentially a little clearer if it closes on Friday. How quickly, that's a big if. How quickly can Elon Musk move to change the platform as some have speculated he would? So I've heard some legal experts say, and whether they're the right ones or not, but they say it could happen immediately. Look, it's gonna be a private company. He could turn this thing on a dime. So this makes it a very interesting and delicate time, really, for Elon Musk to be taking over this company, because you do have midterm elections coming up, November 8th, and these companies, social media companies, Twitter, and the rest of the major US companies, they're all tasked with having a really robust content moderation policy around leading up to elections and after. Certainly that's been an expectation ever since the report came out, the Congressional bipartisan reports in 2016. So also though, Musk is working to sustain demand on the Tesla side. So he's got to balance this, but also he is having to keep that demand up with Tesla stock being down since the acquisition, about 31%. And I'll tell you why in a second, but first let's hit the fact that neither Tesla nor Musk have responded to explain exactly what is going to happen with content moderation on Twitter, once and if the deal really gets done here, that deadline being Friday at 5 o'clock, though Twitter has for its part in August, reaffirmed its position, its policy is called the Civic Integrity Policy, and what it does is it offers prompts to users that direct them to information that the company deems accurate, and it also adds labels to content that it deems misleading. So that policy in effect, but maybe not so much after Friday. But also it's been raised by some of the legal experts I've been talking to concern about Musk straddling not just the work responsibility of SpaceX, Tesla, his other companies, and then bringing Twitter in, but really trying to manage and be the arbiter of what lives and doesn't live on Twitter when it comes to world leaders. We've seen in the past a lot of discord about labels that have been put on lawmakers content, both in the U.S. and abroad, that's still going on recently with lawmakers in Ukraine, in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And so, does Musk want to be in that position? That's a question that I hope he answers soon. It's going to be a difficult balancing act once he is faced with those decisions. You have to wonder what his feed is going to look like too. I mean, you're talking about global leaders. And he has sort of meddled in or weighing it, weighed in on what happens with Russia-Ukraine. He gave that interview with the Financial Times where he talks about what should be done with Taiwan. When you are leading that very platform where the discussion is happening, do the rules change? And the larger question everybody keeps asking is, what does it mean? Those people who were kicked off the platform like Donald Trump, are they going to instantly be reinstated? We don't know. But yes, it could end up being a problem that Elon Musk doesn't want to handle. And yes, could he push these responsibilities off to others who are running the company? Sure. But at the end of the day, the buck kind of does stop with Elon Musk so long as he is the sole owner of this company. We'll have to see how it plays out, but certainly he's going to have to continue to try to curry favor in China, in Germany, and other places where Tesla is operating and make sure that he's pleasing world leaders people of power on the content moderation level. And we don't know for sure that he wants to be the CEO and he's going to be running. We do not know. So all to be determined there, Alexis, thanks so much for that. Well, Intel's self-driving car unit mobile I priced its initial public offering at $21 a share late Tuesday. That's above the $18 to $20 range. That values the company at roughly $17 billion, more than the $15 billion, Intel paid for the company back in 2017, but a ways off from the $50 billion valuation it sought last year. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Dan Halley, who's been watching that for us and Dan. There's a few questions that come with this. Number one, given where the IPO market has been, does the fact that Intel prices at a higher range suggests the appetite is back there again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,23,2022-10-26 15:24:03
4143," is that come with this number one, given where the IPO market has been, does the fact that until prices at a higher range suggest the appetite is back there again? Yeah, I think that's really the big question for this kind of listing, right? This is mobile eye, just to give you some background. This was a company that was originally developing technology to be able to provide a computer vision for self-driving cars. Obviously it's gone heavy into self-driving until picked it up some years ago at around the $15.3 billion mark. And now, as you said, according to these reports, it's, IPO is being priced at $17 billion. But that's below, again, as you pointed out, that $50 billion that was originally being looked at. And this all has to do with just the IPO market kind of falling off after a big 2021, big 2020, big 2019, where we saw some of these mega companies and hit the public markets. Now, we haven't seen very many that are doing a billion dollars more in their IPO or more in their IPO. We have mobile eye here barely touching a billion dollars. But I think it does point to some interest in this kind of company and the long-term growth perspective, excuse me, perspective for something like this, where there is still a lot of work to be done in self-driving cars in computer vision when it comes to vehicles. And so if mobile eye goes public and can get some clients under its belt, then I think that just means that the opportunity really is there for growth. Now, when we talk about self-driving cars, obviously, the discussion ends up pointing towards something like a Tesla GM. What those companies are offering really are just drivers' system technologies. It's not really self-driving, no matter what they call it. It's just still drivers' technology. So the self-driving will still take years to kind of shake out. So there are ample opportunities for companies like mobile eye to kind of really fully establish themselves in the space and they become really the main client for some of these larger automaker brands and see where they can bring the technology going forward. Dan Halley is always seeing on top of the big tech stories for us today. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, Green Champions, California leading the charge on clean, tech, and sustainable innovation. But the question is, are those investments being made in an equitable manner? We're going to hear from one man who is ensuring that's the case at least in Los Angeles. That discussion is on the other side. So",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,24,2022-10-26 15:28:43
4144," Let's go! The Biden administration has set out to deploy more than half a million EV charging stations by the end of this decade. It's part of a larger ambition to slash the number of all gas powered cars in the U.S. by half by 2030. Making that transition equitable though could be a challenge with a majority of charging stations deployed in predominantly white neighborhoods. And our next guest is trying to change that through a unique incubator in Los Angeles. Let's bring in Matt Peterson. He is the CEO of LA Clean Tech Incubator. The segment presented by BMW Matt. Good to talk to you again. You know, it's interesting in preparing for this. I was looking at a map of where all the charging stations are right now. And it's really glaring to see how concentrated they are in predominantly wealthy white neighborhoods. I mean, can you talk about what the landscape looks like in LA where we have seen significant transition to EVs? Yeah, we'll great to see you, Kiko. Thanks for having me on. You know, when we look at new markets and emerging markets, obviously the signals from policymakers in California really put the investment into electric vehicles and the charging infrastructure that makes it possible. Now, what that means is that the early adopters have predominantly been on what we call the West Side of Los Angeles, in our case, which is predominantly white. And what we are doing is an organization through our transportation electrification partnership to seeing how we can accelerate investment into long-come disadvantaged communities, including those communities that have socioeconomic challenges, disinvestment, ruglining, historical and institutional barriers to really get access to the services they need, whether it's adequate transit or transportation, let alone electric vehicles. So by doing pilots and advocating for policies like we successfully advocated for a statewide zero-emissions vehicle advocate for disadvantaged communities or equity advocates, we called it. And the governor is going to point that person for California to help address some of these inequities. But in the meantime, we're working on putting in charging and EV car sharing into places like public housing, where we know populations, people that live there don't have access to adequate transportation, suffer from worse air quality, and really can benefit from these kinds of solutions right there available exclusively for them. Matt, can you talk a bit more about the structure of Lacey? I mean, it's interesting to see how you're sort of playing this from both sides. You're obviously investing in some of these startups that are addressing those very issues you talked about, but you're also deploying these charging stations into more low-income communities and exposing them to them so that there's not as big of a divide in terms of going from a gas-powered car to an EV. Yeah. I think we're helping entrepreneurs in one end, particularly black brown and female entrepreneurs, who have a tougher time getting access to capital. So how do we provide them additional resources and support to get access to capital funding from our own venture fund and, excuse me, debt fund that we provide low-cost financing to them for capital access and working capital? But at the same time, how do we work with local governments and city officials to bring the charging where it needs to go? So our utility partners like Edison and LLEDVP are making programs available to invest in chargers and lower income neighborhoods, but how do we accelerate that? So we're doing a pilot in a community under the Sunson Gardens that's going to be a fast charger at the street near multi-family buildings, a predominantly low-income neighborhood, so that we can then educate people about electric vehicles, make public charging available to them and debt fund.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,25,2022-10-26 15:32:40
4145," near multi-family building, so predominantly low income neighborhood, so that we can then educate people about electric vehicles, make public charging available to them and demonstrate where it is, and how do we also target people that drive Uber and Lyft? How do we get TNC drivers behind the wheel of an EV, and that kind of public fast charging is going to be critical? Well, we'd then work to get level two charging, slower charging inside of multifamily building, so as people can take advantage of the UZD tax credit and the inflation reduction act to buy more affordable EVs that they have a place to charge. Finally, Matt, California has kind of been on the front lines of this transition to go all electric. You've been working very closely with the mayor, Garcetti, there on the ground in shaping LA's policy. Now that you see where the federal government in this administration is trying to take it, I wonder if there are any lessons learned from California slash LA's transition. If you think there is a glaring missing piece when you look at federal policy to address this issue? Well, not every state has a utility pursuing aggressive targets based on public policy or their own utilities commitment to the market for electric vehicles and the charging needed. Not every state has the rebates and additional incentives that California has. So how does the federal government go and provide support directly to cities as much as they can? So through the competitive grant program through the bipartisan infrastructure package, some cities will be able to access those dollars for charging directly. There's state energy offices may not be as interesting deploying those charging stations with funding from federal government equitably into lower income neighborhoods so that people can access the benefits of electric vehicles by having the charging infrastructure in their backyard. Another thing is making sure that those chargers are working. So if you drive an ED sometimes you may experience such a charger that doesn't work and 80% of the time that it does not, it's a non-electrical issue. It means that the Wi-Fi connections down, something like a software issue. So we have a company that we think you've been called Charger Help that's out there making sure we have uptime. So the federal government can make sure those that benefit from the federal government dollars make sure those chargers are working 95% of the time and that there's a company like Charger Help making sure those chargers are working, diagnose them, fix them, keep them up and maintained. Yeah, it's certainly been great to watch the progress of everything you've done over at Lacey. Matt, good to talk to you today. Matt Peterson, CEO of Lacey. Well, coming up, King Dollars Crown slips a touch. UFD ticks lower against major counterparts as investors reassess the outlook for rate high tax on pulling data.

4146," if The results in his seeing the likes of Coca-Cola and Microsoft's IPH impact of the strong dollar. But has the story seen its peak? Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikery who's taking a closer look at some of the key charts we should be watching, Jared. Let's start with the Dixie. This is US Dollar Index. It is heavily weighted to the euro. Some people consider it an agronistic but nevertheless a very good overall gauge. It is down 1%. And you got to keep tabs of who's rooting for a lower US dollars just about everyone. Anyone who likes higher risk markets and here we have a three month chart. Indeed, we are testing the lowest levels here since about one month ago. And if we take a look at a longer term trend line, this is going to be your to date. You can see we broke through to the downside a couple days ago. This is a rather steep interpretation. You can also see on a technical basis there is another trend channel which is in play here. Also not shown is a 50 day moving average. Suffice to say the US dollar, the Dixie at a critical level here. Also want to show you and we're going to get back to currencies in a second that we have volatility coming down. We have the Fed in a blackout period. We have earnings season underway. We have mega cap earnings and focus, Meta's after the bell, Apple's a big one. Everything setting up for a potential rally into the end of the year also based on factors such as the November election. That's just around the corner as well midterm seasonality coming into play. Here is the VIX of the VIX. We can see this second derivative. Maybe it's a third of stock option volatility. This is testing the lowest levels since July. And you take a look at the VIX which is a little bit closer. This is what people usually look at. This is trending down as well. So let's take a look at what's been happening in currencies in a Kiko. You and I follow the Japanese yen on almost a daily basis. The yen is offered by the dollar about 1% today. But I've been looking at the Chinese yuan. This, the Ren Mimbi is down 1.35%. It doesn't seem like a lot, but on an offshore basis, this is the onshore, the offshore, which has been trading since about 2011. This is the steepest decline. I believe on record. So we can see that the US dollar has been strengthened inconsiderably. And we have been concerned that the Chinese yuan may be devalued in a disorderly fashion. That's what happened in 2016 at the very beginning of the year. We'll have to see if there's a repeat of that. But so far, if the mega caps, I believe, can participate here. We do have the impetus for a wrist rally. But we've got to see that US dollar ease and continue to ease as well. Okay. Thanks so much for that, Jared. We're going to stay with the dollar next guest. She believes the greenback is poised to stabilize. I mean, more aggressive ECB and BOE hiking paths toward the end of the year. It comes in a growing evidence that Fed tightening has started to weigh on the US economy, fueling expectations of central bank will temper the pace of its rate hikes. Joining us in studio, we've got Morgan Deldon. She's global ex ETFs head of investment strategy for Europe. Morgan gets a talk to you today. It's certainly fitting when we've started to see a bit of a pullback in the dollar. I was thinking back to even a month ago where we had guests on who were saying it's going to remain high for a very long time. It feels like we made a pivot pretty quickly. Absolutely. I think we are in a turning point because when you look at the rate differential going forward and looking at the past, the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,27,2022-10-26 15:41:33
4147," It's like we made a pivot pretty quickly. Absolutely. I think we are in a turning point because when you look at the red differential going forward and looking at the past, the ECB and the Bank of England are taking as an aggressive, at least as aggressive as the Fed or even more in the near term, the red differential won't lead to stronger dollar. Then you look at the US economy starting to fill the higher interest rates and probably going to a soft landing scenario. So overall from an economic standpoint, interest rate standpoint, it seems that the dollar is posed to stabilize with increasing downward pressures. What's the expectation on your end? How exactly the Fed moves next? I mean, yes, to your point, there's been sort of slowly this expectation building in about the Fed maybe at least pausing or slowing those rate hikes, but we've got another meeting just around the corner. What are you anticipating then? I think it's really too early to say that the Fed is going to pose like on its hit rate hikes. I do think that the main input for the Fed's decision to continue to prescribe 75 basis points is coming from inflation data. And I do see a case that the Fed continues at this pace until it sees a real inflection point in the CPI numbers, which is not yet materialised. So I do think that the Fed is going to continue to hike 75 basis points next week and potentially in December. But then we'll be not far off the 5% mark, which is probably that or very close to the pick for the Fed's front rate this cycle. The Fed has really been leading the way in terms of how quickly they move, how aggressively they move. When you look at major central banks around the world, you mentioned the ECB, the BOA, of course, the Bank of Japan. In Europe, though, we've already seen a pullback. In the expectation seems to be going into the winter, things could get even worse when you think about where energy prices are going. How aggressively do you think the ECB, for example, will need to move as a result of that? Because they have been moving just a little step behind the Fed. I think we have already passed the peak pessimism across Europe. I think now the economic outlook is becoming more stabilised, which also will help stabilising the Euro-adol currency pair. Because I think when you look at the reserves in terms of energy, we are 88% for. We have very little leverage left on Russia in terms of gas imports. There's about 9% now of what we consume. You also look at the economic data. They haven't reflected a massive downturn. They are looking at some softness, but nothing that is critical. So looking ahead with all this fiscal stimulus coming in continental Europe, and it really gives the ECB the power to step up in terms of interest rate highs and bearing in mind that they are starting from a much lower base than the Fed. So playing catch up there, I think. Finally, really quickly, I know you're focused on Europe, but the Bank of Japan increasingly in focus here. We've seen two interventions as far as we know, in terms of the currency markets, you've got the governor there, Karota stepping down in April. And yet, there's still questions about whether in fact they're going to pull back on this yield curve control given where rates have moved. How big of a risk, when you look at from the European perspective, how big of a risk does what's happening over in Japan, Pau? I think it's so far, the Bank of Japan has kept its accumulative stance despite all the central banks increasing. So I don't think there will be a massive U-turn in Japan. And I think if you look at toward the end of the year, the risk of having a more ockish stance from the Fed, Bank of England and ECB has reduced dramatically, which will help potentially reduce the risk of Bank of Japan having a surprising moving in the coming months.

4148," ETFs head of strategy they're good to have you on today. Well coming up spending digital funds as another crypto debit card hits the market and trying to navigate spending limits, regional restrictions and even knowing if staking is needed. We'll discuss with blockchain.com CEO Peter Smith on the other side. We'll check in on the crypto market. We'll see Bitcoin back above 20,000. Well, Ether is back above the $1,500 level, the rally fueled and part by investor optimism. After UK lawmakers voted to recognize crypto as a regulated financial instrument, although the bill still has a way to go before it is passed into law. The crypto market by the way, topping $1 trillion after three weeks under that level. So what is a crypto holder to do with these gains? Our next guest may have an option. Joining us now we've got Yahoo Finance exclusive Peter Smith CEO of blockchain.com joining us as well as Yahoo Finance crypto reporter David Hollerith and Peter you're of course here to announce or debut this new debit card that you're launching in partnership with Visa, also powered by Marquetta. Walk us through how this all works. Yeah, sure. So the idea is that you can take your card. It looks like this. It's a fun little design and you can easily spend from any balance inside your blockchain wallet. So you can spend from your dollar balance, your euro balance, your Bitcoin balance, your Ethereum balance, any of the sort of 30 plus assets inside of your blockchain wallet. And you can toggle between which asset you spend from sort of at any time. We're launching that in the US now and then we'll expand out to you early next year. Peter, we chatted yesterday about why blockchain.com was issuing this debit card now and you said that it came down to a lot of customer demand. But I was curious to just talk more about that and explain exactly how you see customers using crypto to spend on real world goods and services. Because I think there's obviously a lot of questioning about where spending is for crypto. Yeah, so I think you know, as customers, we.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,29,2022-10-26 15:50:13
4149," Because I think there's obviously a lot of questioning about where spending is for crypto. Yeah, so I think as customers become more and more crypto-centric, so they're starting to think about their spending patterns and their financial health from a crypto first angle. They want to be able to spend their assets, their net worth, in daily life. And right now, one of the most challenging parts about being a crypto user is the fact that it's really hard to spend your money to spend your wealth in daily life. Because the links between the crypto system and the traditional banking system are quite tough and frankly slow. And so the reason that we're excited about the card is because it allows people to keep their assets and it keeps their funds inside of the crypto ecosystem, but to be able to spend them in everyday life. Peter, you know this comes out of time and we're sort of seeing the shakedown in the space, trying to figure out who's getting in, who's getting out. From a demand perspective, what does that look like for your card right now? And what does that tell you about where the interest is in the space? Yeah, so we had the wait list open for a really short period of time and we had about 50,000 people sign up for it. And so I think, you know, there's still a lot of demand for crypto products, but you're seeing that demand shift away from sort of trading and more towards folks that are interested in using DeFi, using their balances. You know, right now stablecoin use is growing really quickly on our platform. And so when you look at the assets that people are holding inside of their accounts, you're seeing people hold a lot of stablecoin and big coin frankly. So you're really seeing like a pullback towards quality of crypto assets. Blockchain.com CEO Peter Smith and thank you so much for joining us today and I think to David Hollerith as well for joining in on the conversation. We got much more to come here on Yahoo Finance live. We'll be right back. So so so so so",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,30,2022-10-26 15:54:22
4150," Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. The Chlorox company has announced a recall on some of its multi-surface and all-purpose cleaners that the company says may contain some bacteria. The products recalled by the California-based firm include scented Chlorox propine, propine sole, all-purpose cleaners and Chlorox professional pine sole, lemon fresh cleaners. According to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, the audience recalled may contain a bacteria that's found widely in soil and water, the Commission's advised consumers to take pictures of the bottles if you have them, throw them away, and contact the company for a refund. When we are getting back into the swing of earnings season, tech is certainly a big focus with Amazon now set to announce their third quarter results Thursday after the bell, from what to expect. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Ali Garfinkle. And Ali, we always look to AWS as a big driver for Amazon, but certainly a lot of people want to be looking on the e-commerce site to see to what extent demand has waned. Exactly, Akiko. It's a tense moment for tech earnings overall, and honestly, the read through for Amazon from the other days, Bad Firmetta, which is reporting today, but the read through from Google didn't look good either yesterday. So, you know, there are kind of a couple of things that are analysts are looking for for Amazon right now. The first is you said it, AWS. It's a stalwart of the business. It always went growth at AWS is good for Amazon every single time. The figure I saw was 30% growth is even possible. The second thing that I think is really big is yes, the e-commerce side. We had those prime events, if those prime events generated sales that actually hit the bottom line for Amazon, that could be a big win and go a really long way in getting them to the place where they prove they can be resilient in this really difficult marketplace for tech. And finally, the other question that's always kind of looming in the background with Amazon is this big push we have seen for unions. But we're getting some reports here about at least the push to unionizing California sort of backing off. What's going on there? So, Kiko, I've actually confirmed with the NLRB that union workers at Amazon in Southern California have withdrawn their petition for an election. They were seeking representation by the Amazon Labor Union, which lost the election year Albany last week. So, it's a setback for the unionization effort to be sure. The thing that I've heard from a couple of experts was that for Amazon, big win, for ALU, big loss, however they're not expecting to necessarily see organizing stock in the inland empire in Southern California or across the country. It's a matter of what it looks like. Some momentum has been stripped away, but you also don't only have the Amazon Labor Union operating here at Kiko, right? The other thing to consider is that you do also have, for instance, the teamsters who actually led that walk out in San Bernardino a few weeks ago too. So, it's important to consider there are the unionization efforts. The momentum has stalled a little bit, but I don't expect to see it stop. And it will be looming over earnings and for Amazon for some time still. Okay, Thursday after the bell. It's going to be a busy one for you. Ali, thanks so much for that. Let's do a final check of the markets before we let you go. Ali's just talking about Amazon earnings on Thursday, but today we're going to be looking for the big one meta after the bell and the NASDAQ already down on some of those earnings we got yesterday with Microsoft and Alphabet. Disappointing, at least for investors, that is down about 32 points right now. The Dow up 274 points. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here on Yahoo Finance Live. Keep it right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,31,2022-10-26 15:58:51
4151," [♪ appeared090 Now I own futures ahead of the opening bell here. We've got just about 15 minutes until the start of trade futures. Currently mixed at this point. The NASDAQ is the lone gainer while you've got the Dow on the SB 500 in negative territory. So question is, has the bear market hit its bottom yet or will we continue to see short lived rallies like last weeks for that? Let's bring in Charles Schwab Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Saunders. Liz Ann, great to speak with you as always and get some of your insight around it. So I guess that's the question that we tee up once again. And I feel like we've discussed this time and time again of whether or not we have actually seen a bottom. But if there are three things that would actually indicate that we've hit that bottom, what would that be from your perspective? Well, so we did check a positive box somewhat recently when the market was retesting and ultimately went through its or mid-June lows. There were certain breadth indicators that actually got better. So there were fewer stocks at new lows, even though the overall index was at a new low. That was a positive sign. Unfortunately, as the market is rallied, breadth looks kind of mediocre. So I would have liked to have seen better breadth both on the upside too. I think sentiment had gotten pretty washed out. That establishes a better outlook. But from a more macro perspective, I think what needs to stabilize probably for the worst to be in the rear view mirror would be the housing market. I would specifically look at the NIHB housing market index yields, I think, have to stabilize PMIs and then forward earnings estimates. So from a more macro perspective, that's what I'd look for to get a sense that the worst is over both for the market and the economy. Well, as I know, you're an avid earnings watcher and we're right in the thick of things here. What has been your assessment so far? So weaker than the second quarter, both including energy. So right now, the blended consensus, which is inclusive of companies that have already reported, so that's their actual numbers blended with the consensus for those that are left to report. That's up about 3%. That's down from about 8.5% in the second quarter. If you exclude energy, you go into negative territory about minus 4%, versus minus 2% in the second quarter. So a deceleration. The beat rate is decent, but I think that's in large part due to the much lowered bar that analysts put on consensus since what was the peak in estimates for the third quarter back in the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,32,2022-10-26 16:03:24
4152," The peak rate is decent, but I think that's in large part due to the much lowered bar that analysts put on consensus since what was the peak in estimates for the third quarter back in the late spring. Listen, I love one of the charts that you actually shared this morning on your Twitter, and particularly it was around the US dollars impact. And particularly within this, this foreign exchange FX headwind that's continued to be cited by companies over the course of this earnings season. I mean, how many earnings periods do you believe that this could still be one of those headwinds that has to be navigated by companies? Well, if the dollar continues, it's a cent than I would say the impact on earnings, which is being felt in earnest in the third quarter, doesn't go away. If for whatever reason you see a retreat in the dollar stabilization, I think it becomes less effective, then you also have the possibility of companies deciding whether or not to hedge. That comes into play, but it's being felt right now. About 40% of S&P revenues and sales are directly tied to overseas sources for big cap tech as a sort of a monolith. That's closer to 60%. And you started to hear more commentary from companies about FX impact, the strength of the dollar impact in the second quarter. Now it's even a greater force, both in terms of the hit for the third quarter, but also forward looking commentary. Are you surprised that expectations around rate hikes by the Fed, they look to be beginning to roll over a bit? They are a bit. I think the estimate is starting to move down for 50 basis points in December versus 75 basis points. I think 75 basis points next week is a lock. It does show you that trend and rate of change always matters. No one would ever look at a 50 basis point hike in isolation as a more diverse stance, but it's all relative to the series of 75 basis point hikes. I think that that's natural for us to be at the point where we start to anticipate, pause or at least a step down. I'm happy that the market is no longer focused on pivot to rate cuts, which was the narrative in play when the market started rallying in mid June. Frankly, I think that narrative made no sense because the conditions to give a green light for the Fed to cut rates, I think, would be much more dire economic environment and or much more significant deterioration in the labor market. So I think this shift back to, okay, maybe a step down to a pause is what we should focus on near term. That seems to me to be more appropriate. By the time that we actually are in a recession and of course it would be well after that perhaps that the NVER would actually determine that we were or have incurred a recession. But all of that considered the market's going to try their best to price that in as far ahead as possible. So when does that kind of market pivot happen even ahead of a Fed pivot, even ahead of a recession actually taking place? I think what makes this a cycle a bit different. Yeah, so market peaked out on January 3rd of this year and we went into a bear market so that obviously does reflect the combination of monetary policy tightening and the impact of tighter financial conditions on the economy regardless of whether or not the NVER ultimately declares it a recession. I think what makes it trickier this time and could maybe elongate the process for the market digesting the economy is the rolling nature of what's been happening in the economy, almost a rolling recession where we're clearly in it with housing and many of housing related things, but the services side has been a positive offset. That's just the nature of the pandemic because the demand surge fueled by stimulus had to be funneled into the good side of the economy because services were not accessible. That was the breeding ground for the inflation problem with which we're still dealing, but we're already seeing disinflation and weak demand on the good side with the offset on the services side. So I think there's this elongated rolling nature to the economic downturn which makes it a bit trickier. It's always tough to call the market as it relates to the economy, but trickier because of the rolling nature of this. It just doesn't get any easier.

Let's stay on all things economy and the consumers. Strikingly, different tone from shipping giant UPS this morning on its earnings report compared to longtime rival FedEx. UPS showing good growth in the U.S. and reaffirming its full year guidance ranges. This comes on the heels of FedEx badly whipping on earnings and on courking a fresh restructuring plan just a few weeks ago, UPS CFO Brian Newman just got off his earnings call and joins us now. We need to see you here. Brian is always just for the lay investor out there. These stories between a UPS and a FedEx are now strikingly different, like I just mentioned. Why do you think you and your team are out executing a FedEx? Hey, Brian. Good morning. It's great to see you. Listen, we have a mantra around here, which is control, which you can control. We've been really focused on doing that over the last couple of quarters. The macros have been challenging domestically and particularly internationally. We've been focused on with softer volumes across the world, really. How do we ensure we drive the right pricing mix and dynamics and also control the cost by doing that? You protect your margins and deliver to the shareholders. I just want to stand that before we jump onto the broader quarter. So you're not out there closing sorting facilities, laying people off. I just want to make sure I have it right. So we are tightening the belt. Certainly at the corporate, we spend a lot of money in GNA. We've been tightening the belt there. But we've been doing that for a couple of years trying to right size the business. Carol introduced a better, not bigger strategy to the company and what that really is optimize the volume that comes into the system. So it's more profitable and then take the cost down. So we have been certainly right sizing the business over the last couple of years. But no, we're not closing sorting facilities right now. We have the ability to take our variable to set up a variable cost down should the case arise. And so where are you seeing continued strength within the business and the customers that you're servicing right now? That's a great question, Brad. The healthcare segment is a particularly strong one. We're doing very, very well there. As you think about the small and medium business, that's been a core focus over the last couple of years. We've been addressing the capabilities that those customers want. And by doing that, you create a wonderful environment for a very profitable customer. So we've been focused on the SMB, small and medium business, the healthcare segment. And then overall trying to look at that international business because there's lots of growth opportunity there for us. We've been talking a lot about FX headwinds, that companies are seeing right now. And when you think about that international business, of course, UPS is going to be rolling out some pricing increases. This also impacts the international segment in December, I believe. And that really going to be reflected as you finally get into 2023 as well. What is your anticipation around where the consumers and the strength that you were just laying out where they'll continue to take that price increase? So we announced a price increase for next year at 6.9%. That's supposed to be representative of a combination of inflation as well as the service we provide. So that'll help drive the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,34,2022-10-26 16:12:01
4154," increase. So we announced a price increase for next year at 6.9%. That's supposed to be representative of a combination of inflation as well as the service we provide. So that will help drive the base rate in terms of the pricing equation. As we think about the currency impact that you mentioned, Brett, the currency impact in the quarter was about $82 million. So it is a meaningful headwind on our international business, but we're effectively offsetting that as we manage the portfolio across the domestic business and then across some of the other segments. Brian, I recently spoke to another Brian. Brian Cornell over a target for our all market summit conference last week. He's the holiday season is he's expecting to be pretty good. What's your read on things? So Brian and I used to work together at PepsiCoast. I know him and target is a very important customer for UPS. I actually think it's going to be a decent peak season. We're ramping up right now. We're hiring. We hire over 100,000 people for the peak season to get ready. And with cart targets, customers like target, we're out there committing to them that we're going to be there with the excellent service that UPS provide. So I think that Brian that the peak season, our peak season volume goes up 50, 60% from a normal run rate. So it is a meaningful increase. But as we think about peak this year, you don't have the low inventory levels that we saw last year, which drove an earlier peak. People were rushing out to buy because they were afraid the inventory wouldn't be there for the holiday season. This year, inventories are much higher at the retail stores. So I think it'll be a bit of a later peak, Brian. All right, competing against Santa Claus like efficiency there in the logistics business. When you think about some of the future investments as well, they're Brian and going out into next year and even beyond, what are the investments that you would like to see the company get right the first time in order to build a logistical network and a system that can really see its margins excel over the future? So that's a great question, Brad. The digital investments we're making, it's really shifting dynamic of UPS, old school package delivery. To now, it's more of an orchestrator of volume from end to end. We're putting investments into things like RFID technology so that every package in our system will have a code on it that we know where it is. And if there's nothing more frustrating for consumers or customers, when they lose a package or they have an issue, they want to know where that package is by deploying this kind of technology. We're going to be able to tell people where are your packages and how can we recover and make sure we get them there on time for when the customers want them. And we do that at an incredible mid 90s percent in terms of on time delivery. Brian, I made this comment earlier on the show before you came on in. And I said, UPS is benefiting from, of course, having you as CFO, but also Carol too, long time CFO, a home depot before she came to you. Am I off base there? Are you guys just looking at the quarter or your business differently than other big public companies? Brian, it's wonderful to have a boss who used to be a CFO because we have great conversations, but Carol's done an amazing job shifting the culture. So as we think about the future of UPS, the yesterday's UPS is not going to get us tomorrow to where we want to be. We're 115 year old company, very proud of our past, but Carol is shifting the company to a place called Better and Bolder. The bolder is growth and margin improvement. And so where is that going to come from? Areas of basically leaning into the most attractive parts of the market. I mentioned SMB. Margians are great. It's a very attractive area. Healthcare. That's a high growth, high margin area. International. We're actually number two and three in a number of markets overseas. So we're focused on ceiling revenue share, value share as we call it and going out there. So we're putting our investments in those areas that will be accreted from an investment perspective. UPS CFO, Brian Newman. Thanks so much for joining us here this morning and breaking down the most recent quarter. Appreciate it. Thanks, Brian. Brian Brad. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,35,2022-10-26 16:16:20
4155," you For employees with low hourly income and low earned income with no impact. What percentage of healthcare services are now trained and patient areas have been addressed and big, targeted but moderate the US's economic outlook. But we'll hawkish Fed, pull the US into recession, and how is the business cycle playing out compared to previous recessions? SAP Global Ratings, Chief Economist, Beth Ann, Bavino joins us. Now, Beth Ann always nice to get some time with you. This morning, we are waiting for a lot of earnings. You have Coca-Cola out here raising prices by 12%. We just talked to UPS and CFO saying, they don't really see any signs of per se a recession in their business looking for a good holiday season. Do you think we just avoid our recession? We have a baseline in our forecast for a recession. We think it's going to be a very shallow one. But a recession nonetheless is largely because of affordability issues, both because of still incredibly high prices, as you just noted, by the increase in final prices for US households, as well as affordability tied to interest free hikes. So in both cases, we think the consumers will slow down dramatically leading into a very shallow recession for early next year. Interesting. So with that in mind, where do you believe the mindset of the consumer would be by that point? Well, we're looking at the numbers from a consumer confidence a bit weaker than what we in market had expected. The idea is there that even that we expected a little bit not as extreme, largely because we saw a bit of a pickup in the stock market, as well as pooling of gasoline prices. Well, that's not enough for consumers. We're still disappointed. And because it's not just about gasoline, it's about affordability and pretty much all aspects of society, particularly for shelter, not just home purchasing a home, but also renting a home. And that means less money to spend elsewhere. People are squeezed and we do think that we'll find we'll buckle. Bethan, I've really been surprised by how many or how much price increases, a lot of these big companies have been reporting in recent weeks as they've come out with earnings. I continue to double-gen, double-gen increases for products and services, really for the second quarter in a row. When does it stop? When are we beyond these double-digit increases? Well, we're expecting to see eventually one of the reasons the good news about a recession, it also brings lower prices. And the big question of is, what if consumers do slow down as we expect? That means there's going to be more inventory on businesses' books. So if we do do see a sleep, sleep slow down for consumers, then we end up seeing as a lot of inventory used to be unloaded. And unfortunately, those at that inventory is unloaded at lower prices. So in a deep, indeed, the fact gets us wish in the end. But of course, there's a cost to both businesses and consumers as well. We've got a lot of companies that have started reporting earnings fast and furious in this most recent quarter. But the forward guidance here is going to be the big question. What are your expectations for where companies will continue to either reiterate their guidance or for some of them? We've already seen that, at least in the case of SNAP. No, a specific name. But where they might start to say, you know, what we have to either pull back our guidance or just pull it in entirety. And what net impact would that have? Well, speaking from an economic position, again, I don't cover particular industries or companies. But I can say that given this environment, this is a classic overpeeding situation for the United States, where the Fed has to come in and be incredibly aggressive. Understandably, we have core inflation still at a 40-year high on a year over your basis. So they have to move. And with that said, what I suspect we could see for those businesses that switched from just to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,36,2022-10-26 16:20:39
4156," for inflation still at a 40-year high on a year over your basis. So they have to move. And with that said, what I suspect we could see for those businesses that switched from just in time in inventory accumulation to just in case inventory of accumulation, that means that they're going to be squeezed. And so I suspect the floor of guidance would be basically what happens to profits when we have to unload all those inventories. That's where I suspect we can see some activity, particularly for retail, the retail sector, who have been holding on to things. But I suppose other areas would be squeezed as well. Within your outlook, Beth Ann, for a mild recession, is the economy shedding jobs? Are we talking about non-farm payroll reports where maybe there's 50,000 jobs should? In our business cycle barometer, the one indicator that is still showing positive, everything else is neutral or negative and extremely negative. But the one area that we're seeing still positive territories in that jobs market that you pointed to, we're looking at job openings coming down, slowing down, but still rather high. So the question is, our business is canceling that job opening and still want to hold on to those workers. I suspect in certain areas that we're going to see the crunch retail I mentioned, housing. Also, I suspect we're going to see some kind of a cutting of jobs, but overall, we suspect a mild impact on jobs. And we do expect to see the unemployment rate rise, but we're looking at something that's going to be by 2024, about 5.5%. In normal times, that's what we used to get to. So indeed, we'll see a pickup, but nothing dramatically. Dramatically so. Bethan Bovino, S&P Global Ratings, US Chief of Combs. Always good to see you. Talk to soon. We'll talk to currently looking positive across all three Great thunderstorms that are here. side factors joining us now is Barry Bannister, Chief Equity Strandis at C. Fullbury. We could all use some positive news after the last month that we've had. Certainly we have seen gains pick up over the last few weeks on this expectation potentially of a Fed pivot. What are you watching right now in terms of levels that that really you think could push things in the right direction? Well, you know a lot of the bad news was known and we had a violent sell-off in the first 10 months of this year. If you look at the nominal peak of the S&P 500 index, it was 4,800 on January 3rd, but the real inflation adjusted purchasing power peak was 5,100 on December 29th. So we fell about 31.5%, which if you look at the 14 bear markets since 1947, in the post-World War II era really, the 14 bear markets associated with recessions, the average and what we call the trend mean taking out the highest in the lowest was 31.7%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,37,2022-10-26 16:25:01
4157," The trend mean taking out the highest and the lowest was 31.7. So we had a bear market, an ambitious malling bear market due to fed policy. But when we analyze all the fixed income, currency, futures, political, economic, geopolitical factors, we come up with a view that if the Fed is not turning the dial to tighten every single day, that's effectively a second derivative easing. In other words, not raising the volume is a form of lowering the volume. And I don't think the Fed gets tighter than what's embodied in futures. In fact, I think futures are probably overstated in May of 2023 at nearly 5% on short rates. Inflation is going to come down. Any first year economic student in college could do what we did. All you do is break down inflation into its sub components and all of them point down. So Barry, does that mean that you're in the camp that you think the Fed could potentially pause some of these rate hikes because you think that inflation is starting to show some signs of moderating and that the Fed can't move to aggressively. Well, we look at GDP right on a quarterly annualized. So we take the most recent quarter, we annualize it, multiply it to the fourth power. We annualized GDP. Well, let's annualize inflation. So CPI inflation for the three months ended September, annualized was only 2%. Yes, it's 2%. So the momentum of inflation has already turned down. If you take the core, it consists of services and that is shelter services. So that would be housing related. Those are already turning down. Yes, there's a lag, but they are turning down decisively. On rents, home prices, you saw the data today. You look at non-shelter services. Wages are the key driver and wages such as the land to Fed, wage tracker and average hourly earnings year to year change. And hopefully, on the 28th, the employment cost index all points down. So again, you know, you have to steer the ship with a long lead time. The Fed knows that and they've done their job. They flatten the curve by end of year. The curve will be completely flat if not inverted in some points, obviously, 10 to 2s. But as they do that, we have to be ahead of that. We have to think, okay, well, the Treasury is worried about bond market liquidity. Treasury Secretary Yellen, former chair Yellen of the Fed made a statement yesterday. The Treasury is intently focused on bond market risk due to liquidity and other concerns. So if the market is always a head of reality, we have to get ahead of that. And so it looks to us like there'll be a rally October to April. I wouldn't overstate the rally. There are a lot of tail risks later in 23. But again, the market is always looking ahead and we're trying to keep up with it. And I admit, it's a really hard job. So Barry, you mentioned some key risks there that could derail that upwards climb to 4300. One of them being oil shots. What's the big concern there right now? The G7 and the West collectively are desperately trying to establish what's called a buyer's cartel on Russian oil. And naturally, and you can't blame them, OPEC Plus, which is OPEC's many member states plus Russia, they don't want with their sellers cartel to have a competing buyer's cartel. So they're not cooperating and they shouldn't cooperate. That would just be a logical to expect them to do so. So the early December, there is this planned cap on Russian oil. That could create tremendous volatility. Russia has a lot of avenues. I personally would be thinking they might target the CPC pipeline out of Kazakhstan to reduce flows without cutting their own production to drive the price up. And if oil rockets higher, oil is at the core of inflation. This is what the ESG people never understood. That all energy is, all GDP is the conversion of energy. And because of some of the dragging risks on GDP growth, demographics, debt, we don't have the kind of growth we used to have. And as a consequence, we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,38,2022-10-26 16:29:20
4158," of energy. And because of some of the dragging risks on GDP growth, demographics, debt, we don't have the kind of growth we use to have. And as a consequence, we need cheap energy. And so more expensive energy is not going to solve this problem. So if energy goes up, that's the core of inflation. That drives everything, including core CPI and core PCE. So we don't need an oil shock. And that's the risk here. I remember the 1970s very well. We had a 73, 74 oil embargo. And then in 79, we had a second oil shock due to the shower around falling in Iran. We don't need that. And so geopolitically, I think we've got some very poor diplomatic policy out of Washington. And hopefully they don't drive us over the edge with a secondary oil shock, having already depleted the strategic petroleum reserve. Steve Fultc chief equity strategist Barry Bannister. It's good to talk to you today. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Let's switch gears and go back to shares of General Motors. A company we've been tracking all morning here. That stock is up 3.5%. After the company posted a big earnings beat, but maintained its guidance for a deeper dive in the auto space. That's bringing an auto blog editor in chief. Greg Migliore. Greg, good to talk to you today. We were kind of diving through the numbers with our auto correspondent, Praz earlier, who said, look, it feels like at least with the GM story, things have started to turn the corner. Things are looking a little better on supply chains, the chip shortage in terms of inventory. What was your big take away from the numbers we got this morning? Sure. Well, good morning. Thanks for having me back. General Motors had a record third quarter for revenue based on profitable sales. It trucks of SUVs in North America. They really got the supply chain under control, which quite simply allowed them to make and sell more vehicles. It really wasn't a rocket science. It all really came together for them in the last quarter. They also had a lot of good publicity, too. They had the reveal of the GMC Sierra and the Chevy Equinox electric vehicles. Even the Chevy Bolt, which is their smaller electric crossover in car, had strong sales numbers. It bounced back from some recall issues that they had had previously. So this is basically General Motors near-term strategy. Sell lucrative trucks of SUVs to fund the electric vehicle programs. And they do this while consumers and sort of the company figure out what's to come next as far as EVs. And how do you see demand shaping up, especially with some of those EV trucks that you say will be the revenue driver that accelerates the transition or the company's transition to all EVs? I think of the next couple years, you're going to see demand really increase for some of these vehicles from General Motors. They're really targeting high-volume segments like the Sierra and the Silverado. These are full-size pickup trucks. They already sell a lot of vehicles with internal combustion engines in these segments. So quite simply adding some electric versions. I mean, it's really a part of the market where they can capture and grow market share. And that's actually what they did in the third quarter. They their market share hovered around 16%, which was up from about 13% a year ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,39,2022-10-26 16:33:41
4159," actually what they did in the third quarter. They, their market share hovered around 16%, which was up from about 13% a year ago. Now that might not sound like a lot, but in the auto industry, it's so competitive, just to get even a sliver of market share. So to me, that was another sign that things are going in the right direction for general motors. Looking ahead here, Greg, we're gonna be watching for numbers out from four. This is another one of those legacy companies that has gone through a lot of transition in the process of going all electric, including staff cuts. How do you think that's gonna be reflected in the quarterly numbers? I think it'll be a little too early to tell as far as some of the moves that they've made just in the last couple quarters, how that will shake out for Ford's bottom line. What's interesting to me is how they're setting up their electric vehicles and their turtle combustion vehicles is almost like separate units, and they're gonna break those out and display those numbers in the future. I think that'll be, that'll paint an interesting picture as far as where Ford is right now and where they're going in the future. It's a very creative approach to accounting to reporting financial numbers. So we'll be looking to see how that lands. Okay, that stock, at least getting a lift from GM's numbers today too. Audible, editor, in chief, Greg Migliori. We're good to talk to you today. We'll be now to the New York Stock Exchange, oil and gas investment vehicle, Granite Ridge making its market debut today via a SPAC, the company, backed by former house speaker Paul Ryan, Ranging the opening bell this morning and joining us to discuss. We've got Paul Ryan, of course, former Speaker of the House and Chairman of the Executive Network Partner and Corporation SPAC. We've also got Luke Brandenburg, who's Granite Ridge CEO. And it's great to have both of you on today. Speaker, I want to start with you first because it's been a rough patch coming here. We were just alluding to some of the big exodus that you saw in terms of investors. Well, they saw that you were partnering up with Granite. Talk to me about how you're thinking about this as you mark this milestone moving forward. Yeah, well, it's a pretty tough market for any company trying to go public. So we were very careful in who we chose as partners because we wanted to get it done and stick to the landing like we did today. So that's why we're very excited to be partnering with these Granite Ridge guys. We wanted to find a business that had very good balance sheet. These guys are unlevered, they got good free cash flow. And it's in a very, very attractive sector, oil and gas. They're not operating oil and gas platform company. So we wanted to find someone that we knew should go public and would be able to make it through the distance. So that we're really excited to partner with these guys. Luke, when you think about the space oil and gas certainly been very lucrative this year. We have seen some of these big oil majors hit key records in earnings as we look ahead to the winter and looking at the headwinds, whether it's within the US but globally on demand as well as supply. How do you think about the investment environment in the space right now? I think we're starting to see just a lot more positive investors sentiment than we had for quite some time. I think that the storyline about oil and gas is really changing and you're seeing that transition to how important energy security is, energy reliability both on a national and even more so now on an international scale. And so it's been great. I'd say investor in bounds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,40,2022-10-26 16:38:15
4160," Seeing that transition to how important energy security is energy reliability, both on a national and even more so now on an international scale. And so it's it's been great. I'd say investor in-bounds were quite quiet for some time, but we're starting to see that pick up and folks that are really more interested in what we're doing. And so it's it's certainly something that's great to see on the day that you're bringing the bell in the exchange. And look to what extent do you see that accelerating going into the winter where we're really expected to see a crunch and supply? Well, I think that it's a great question, Kiko. And I really think that this is a defining moment that the fact of the matter is a really cold winter will create immense pressure on the global energy supply chain. And I think a lot of investors are looking at that. They want to prepare for it. And I hope that the takeaway is that this is something that we need to focus on for the long term. And that we're able to have some resilient investors in the space that are willing to just stay in and truly understand what we can do in the big picture. Speaker, now that we have you on, we do have to talk about the midterms or what just two weeks out exactly from where things stand. It felt like a month ago we were talking about this momentum for Democrats on some of the social issues including abortion. The latest polls show a big swing in favor of Republicans and the economy. What do you think shifted in the last month? The economy, I think, years look everybody knows we're in or headed to an inflation to a recession. The last headline inflation numbers, core inflation numbers were really high. So I think people got more concerned about their pocketbooks, about jobs, about what the economy is going to look like than they were about social issues. And I think you write. I think the Democrats peaked probably in August, maybe early September. But now I think people are much, much more concerned about the direction of the economy. Democrats are not, they don't pull nearly as well on the economy. I think they try to wreck it basically with bill back better. I'm not a big fan of the inflation reduction act. And they try to do much worse tax policy. They didn't. So I think what voters want to do is set a check on Washington. They don't want one party rule by the left. And that's why I really feel pretty confident in saying that we're going to win the House. And I think we got a really good chance to win in the Senate. And I think in a large measure because voters want to check on all this left-word lurch. And they want some calm economic policies. And so that's why I think we're peaking at the right time. That's why I think the momentum is with us right now. And so yeah, two weeks out, I feel very good, much better than I felt, say back in August. Obviously, you know, we watched the midterms always to see a gauge of where things could go two years from now in the presidential election. And you made some headlines recently where you said that you believe that former president Trump would be unelectable, come 2024. And yet we're looking at some very competitive races in places like Arizona, places like Pennsylvania, where there are Trump-backed candidates who are polling pretty well. So what do you make of that disconnect there? I mean, why do you think that's been the case if you don't know that? They are not him. They are not him. And look, we lost the House, the Senate and the White House, in the span of two years with Trump. Never before is my party lost as much that fast. So my point is, come 2024, we want to win. We want to beat Biden or the Democrats, whoever they're running. And we know it's just a factual statement, polling wise, we are worse off with Trump as our nominee than with somebody else. So I just think it's going to be palpable in 2024 that because we want to win and beat the Democrats, we know as a party we're better off with somebody else to be our nominee, to more guarantee a victory, because we know we lose with Trump. It's the suburban voter. They're the big difference maker. I can tell you, in Wisconsin, 64,000 Wisconsinites voted for all the Republicans on the ballot and not Donald Trump. That gets translated across the country in the swing states. It's a huge difference maker. So I just think from just winning, we are going to want to win come 2024. And that means we need to elect somebody to be our nominee that's going to better deliver a victory. And I think it's going to be pretty well known at that time. Luke, you know, when you think about what's been playing out in the energy space, there's been a lot made of some tensions between the Biden administration, as well as the oil and gas companies in terms of, you know, the lack of investment or at least as the White House season. If in fact, these predictions hold, we're talking about a Republican majority in the House, potentially in the Senate. How do you see that shifting that strategy around energy moving forward? I think that the goal and what we really hope to accomplish is just a rational conversation about energy. What you're seeing in particularly midterm season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,41,2022-10-26 16:42:32
4161," You just have folks that are taking one extreme side, one of the other. Either pider carbons need to go away forever or how do carbons need to stay forever. The fact the matter isn't, and Speaker Ryan has said this before, we needed all of the above strategy. And to get there, we just need a rational conversation. I'd say that's the most frustrating part for folks that are in the industry. You've got hundreds of thousands, millions of people that are coming to work every day working hard, trying to create oil and gas, to create energy, to provide energy security and reliability. And then you go out and the President of your country is condemning you for doing that. And it's not fun. I really hope that we can create a more practical conversation where we can have a real dialogue about what is the best way, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, to power this country, and to power the world and the growth that we anticipate seeing. Yeah, I would just say, Kiko, look, American oil and gas producers are the cleanest producers, they're the most efficient producers. This is really good for American jobs. It's good for bringing the inflation down and it's very good for foreign policy to be able to give our allies access to our oil and gas. And by the way, gas is a great bridge fuel to a lower carbon future. So I think it's an attractive sector. I think it's very good for America. And I do believe that my friends in Congress, when they take the majority, which I think they will, understand this. And they're going to bring some more common sense conversation to the whole energy discussion. Let's talk about one more thing that could potentially flare up again, depending on the outcome, we should say, of the midterms, the debt ceiling. This is another fight that could potentially emerge as a flashpoint, come 2023. You're a veteran of that. And I wonder how you're thinking about the Republicans using this as leverage. Do you think they should be, or is it time to abolish the debt ceiling altogether? I've been through so many debt. I can't even count how many debt ceiling fights I've been through. America's going to keep its full faith in credit. We're not going to re-knick on the debt. And yeah, always. Democrats have done this to Republicans. Democrats have done this to Democrats. It's a moment for a fiscal, it's a fiscal-impasse moment where you should get a down payment on good fiscal policy. I was on the Bulls Simpson Commission, which Democrats held hostage in order to get a commission during the debt limit debate. So we've had spending caps on debt limit debates. We've had so many fiscal policies being attached to debt limit because you don't want to just keep rubber stamping more borrowing. You want to try and get some kind of policy in place to get the curve in going in the right direction, try and bend the curve on debt. We will have a debt crisis in this country in the not-to-distant future if we don't get our fiscal house in order. And so I think it's a very important point. Having said all of that, I'm very confident that the U.S. dollar is secure and that our bonds we paid and that the full faith in credit of the United States government is going to be intact in this divided government that we're likely to have in the future. All right, and former Speaker of the House and Chairman of the Executive Network Partner Incorporations Pack and Luke Brandenburg, Granite Ridge CEO, thanks to both of you today really appreciate the time. Thank you, Keith. It really is nice to be cheering you. you you The company saying this morning in a news release quote, yees recent comments and actions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,42,2022-10-26 16:46:57
4162," Kanye West also goes by yay over a string of anti-Semitic remarks. The company saying this morning in a news release quote, Yees recent comments and actions had been unacceptable, hateful, and dangerous and they violated the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness. Joining us now for a discussion on all this, Anjali Jenshin Donate, practitioner and residence at the University of New Haven and Sam Pozer, Williams trading senior equity analyst nice to have you both. Anjali will start with you. Why do you think it took Adidas so long to make what appeared to be an obvious move? You know, I think the financial implications really had their team thinking of how do they resolve this. We're in the fourth quarter. Everyone's racing to get to December and sales are really stressed. We have the holiday sales. We have aging inventory and this may have been their priority before they made the decision to really communicate what their brand values are and where they stand. Sam, you see the stock off just over 3% today. Adidas without the Yeesy partnership, what does that look like from a business perspective? Well, I mean, I thought when Kanye left Nike that really, Kanye wanted the keys to the castle at Nike, Adidas decided to give it to him and probably at the end of the day, it'll be better for Adidas. Even though in the short term, likely, you know, they're going to lose some revenue. Are you surprised the stock is down just 3% Sam and do you think the hesitation had something to do with the CEO transition, which happens early next year? I mean, the estimates are that I think it's about $2 billion that Kanye brings in and if that's accurate, I mean, I don't think those decisions are difficult. You know, I think as somebody mentioned earlier, they were one of the first ones to put it under root to put their agreement with him under review. I'm really messaging or reputation. Let's start there means everything to a brand. When you take a look at what that messaging then should be from Adidas at this point, since it did take them so long to respond, what are the next steps that they need to take in order to win back? Maybe some of the customers who don't necessarily trust them right now? Well, that's what that's what it's all about is they've really broken trust with their customers and now they're really going to have to repair that. Being able to communicate and communicating immediately and getting in front of the crisis is important. When it comes to crisis management with any brand working with a celebrity, you need to have this in place crisis management. You can't control what a celebrity is going to say, but you need to know what your action will be and your leadership needs to be aligned on what messaging will be. What for the best plan for the worst? Interesting. Sam, I want to ask you about another statement that was part of Adidas announcement and it said it was interesting that lead you to wonder what's coming. Adidas is the sole owner of all design rights to existing products as well as previous and new colorways under the partnership. We may not know more until November 9th when they report. Does that lead you to believe Adidas may try to keep this brand alive under some different name and is there a legal challenge ahead? I was starting with the last question. I don't know. There already are, if you look at the website, some interpretations of some of the Kanye product under the Adidas logo and I believe that may have been one of the reasons why Kanye was potentially trying to sever that relationship prior to today's announcement anyway. These agreements that were made in the one with Nike and so on, the designs belong to belong to the company, not to Kanye. What they're going to do and how that will be received, I think are to be determined. And my guess is given that Adidas is looking for a new CEO, that's not going to be an upcoming earnings revelation. I'm going to put a similar question to you, but what do you think from a branding perspective, from a marketing perspective, that they should do with the designs that they have from the easy collection?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,43,2022-10-26 16:51:27
4163," the partnerships that can support them. The whole premise with working with him was to really attract a young customer. Gen Z, Gen X, millennials, they were attracted to this type of merchandise. If they have a gap in their portfolio, they need to think long-term and they need to look at a strategy that'll be beneficial, not rely on a personality or celebrity. And how they do that, they'll really need to think about how they really reinvent their in-house design team. Onjali, for other companies, let's just say in this sector, what is the lesson here in terms of crisis management? Crisis management, your brand is your hero. So that is your voice and that's your messaging. So if you're gonna do any type of partnership, you need to really evaluate the risk at hand. You need to be able to have a plan and understand what that roadmap looks like. Branding is about creating a value proposition. And when you are messaging anything, everything communicates. So really focus on your brand as the hero. Your product is the hero and your messaging is what pulls customers in. That's what people are attracted to, your brand values and your voice. Sam, you cover footlocker and the note that you just put out this morning, you said that Adidas cutting ties with Kanye will have an immediate effect further increase challenges facing a footlocker today. What does that look like? Well, I mean, so Nike, we believe that Nike has reduced their allocations to footlocker. We think it's in the $800 million to $1 billion at cost. And they also plan to expand their business with Adidas over the next few years to about $2 billion. The only sort of instant sell out rapid sell out category of shoes they had from Adidas was Kanye. So that's a lot of business gone right away. And from what we understand, other parts of Adidas aren't doing quite as well. And as I wrote in the note, footlocker has a lot of open to buy dollars to buy things other than Nike. The question was and probably is more magnified today is do the consumers have the open to purchase when all that new product shows up that's not Nike. And that, given what happened with Kanye today, that just got a lot worse for footlocker. With the phrase, Not every day that law's Angela's gets news of less traffic, but that is indeed the case. Unfortunately, it won't help you with your morning commute much. Check out the view of the Port of Los Angeles in 2021, massive backups of container ships, the marine exchange of Southern California posting this picture just last week showing a relatively clear view. Read you understand that this concept of insurance performs a lot of naming",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,44,2022-10-26 16:56:07
4164," the marine exchange of Southern California posting this picture just last week showing a relatively clear view. Jeans Rok, a port of Los Angeles executive director joining us now in studio. Good to see you, sir. Thanks for being out here on the other coast. It is dramatic. 109 ships in January. Seven this week is as good news or bad. No, it really is good news and good afternoon to you both. We went from 109 down to 20 by the month of June down to single digits by July all while breaking records five of the first seven months of the year, nearly going box for box with our record setting 20-21. The difference, getting that cargo off the terminals and into the American economy. So Jeans, this doesn't have anything to do then with a pullback and consumer spending, weakening economy, anything like that. Is that factoring in at all here? Not really. Just a few months we've seen a softening for two main reasons. One, importers brought in their cargo a little bit earlier than normal. June and July were our peak season months this year. They didn't want to get in the backups that they had witnessed in the last couple of years. And two, our dock workers negotiation on a new coast wide contract with their employers' association is going on a little bit longer and slower than many would like. And importers have shifted cargo to the east and Gulf Coast where we're now unfortunately seeing backups of ships. I do want to return to the employment labor status and moment, but you're not seeing an overall lower demand internationally. No, not really. And here's why. July, August and September, consumer spending numbers were flat, but still elevated compared to 2019. We as consumers are still buying at a fairly high clip compared to what we've normally been used to doing, even though we're spending more on restaurants, movies and the airplanes are very full. Gene, you mentioned volumes are cooling some of those cargo ships now being directed to the southern ports or to the eastern ports. What are you doing or are you doing anything to try and recapture some of those, some of that demand? Oh, thousand percent. Both the employers and the union have put out two media releases jointly signed, unprecedented from my view point, saying that we will not strike, we will not lock out our workers, have confidence that these gateways will still work and they are productivity has never been higher. So we're out knocking on doors, beating on the drum, making sure that folks know we've got a short amount of time left before the all important retail holiday season. We've got to get the goods to market. LA is open for business. What are you seeing in the reduced costs of shipping globally? Really now it's getting interesting because that spot market rate has declined precipitously over the last several months. Now in the Trans-Pacific theater running from Asia to the United States, most of that business is contracted annually and some decided to go multi-year on their agreements. The spot market is not a majority of the business but it does have an influence when these rates drop like they have on what folks are going to be looking at in the quarters upcoming. And Jim, we've talked a lot about the shortage of truckers in the past, also the headwinds when it comes to some of the rails and the ability to get some of the product out. Where do those headwinds stand? Are they still a big challenge for the port of LA? Yeah, the supply chain is always in need of improvement, constant movement forward. What we've seen right now is that earlier this year, the rail volume increased by six fold and we collectively as an industry have had trouble keeping up with that. Until the recent eight weeks, we've seen rail volume idling at the port of Los Angeles dropped by more than 50 percent, same with those aging containers. I think we finally had the breakthrough on the rail that we finally needed. Truck volume has really moved in really well. The time a container sits at the port of LA before it moves out by truck is at pre-pandemic times, meaning it's moving very fast. Circling back to the labor agreement which expired in July, what are the big holdups? When do you expect a deal to get done? Collective bargaining is hard. This is really tough work. We're not only trying to put a coast-wide contract together for all 22,000 workers and the 29 ports that they support, but with those 29 ports you have all local issues that must be solved in parallel with the big coast-wide agreement. There's going to be continued work. We've got season professionals at the table on both sides and as I mentioned, the service level has not deteriorated one Iota.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,45,2022-10-26 17:00:11
4165," In your work, we've got season professionals at the table on both sides. And as I mentioned, the service level has not deteriorated one Iota. We'll keep moving this cargo and let these folks concentrate on getting this deal done. We'd like to see it done now so we can send that market signal that we're ready. Are you confident though you'll get a deal before your end? That remains in question. And we're going to continue to work with all stakeholders I know from the Biden administration through Governor Newsom's office, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Arsetti, and all of us pushing both sides to stay at the table and chip away at these issues. The sooner, the better for the American economy. In this episode of influencers, SEC chair Gary Gunsler. I come with a deeply markets background. I really believe in markets. I think markets are critical part of our economy, but regulated markets. Events in Eastern Europe just, you know, sort of highlight once again the importance of cyber resiliency. If you're raising money from the public, the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money, that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities laws. And it's it's kind of straightforward. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to our guest Gary Gunsler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gary Gunsler was sworn into office as the 33rd chair last April. And in a little under a year in office, he's pushed the SEC right into the middle of the conversation surrounding cryptocurrency, meme stocks, and other issues as well. Chair Gunsler, thanks so much for joining us. Andy, it's so good to be with you and your viewers. Thank you. Whole lot to get to, but I want to start with the news in Ukraine, especially the reaction from the business community, the New York Stock Exchange recently moved to temporarily halt trading for Russia based companies. Have you been monitoring that and should it be a permanent ban? So just stepping back from any one circumstance, the staff of the SEC are monitoring markets as we do through these times, through throughout the whole time that I've been at the agency, it's not just about the geopolitical events in Eastern Europe. But yes, they're monitoring. We're staying close to those events. We're talking to our colleagues at the US Department of Treasury and across the financial regulatory complex, the Federal Reserve, and other regulators, as well as globally to regulators. And the banking and the securities fields across the globe, just to stay close and monitoring events with these really unusual events out of Eastern Europe and war in Ukraine. Do you feel you have enough transparency into US corporate exposure to Russian assets and the Russian economy? Do you have worries about hidden US connections as the Russian economy may be headed for recession or worse? Well, and I'm going to stick to our remitt at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is about overseeing yes, $100 plus trillion capital markets, and ensuring that they're fair and orderly, efficient, and in these unusual times, we're monitoring for that. But I do feel that we've had good dialogue with major market participants in the fund area, broker dealer area, the exchanges, the clearing houses, and at least for these handful of days so far, the market functions have been operating relatively well. But what comes tomorrow, what comes in the future, we're monitoring against.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,46,2022-10-26 17:04:26
4166," relatively well, but what comes tomorrow, what comes in the future, we're monitoring against, you know, events as they come. I understand it's not straight ahead into your remit, but obviously as you suggest yourself, there are implications potentially and potential even systemic risk to the global macro system. One last question here, Chair Gensler, about that though, are there other actions the SEC is taking or considering taking in response to what's going on in Ukraine and Russia. Again, we're staying alert and monitoring, we're staying close with the rest of the financial stability oversight, council agencies and our colleagues around the globe. If you look at funds under management, the total multiples of tens of trillions of dollars of assets under management here in the US, only a very small percentage well, we've measured well below 1%, in fact, only a fraction of 1% are invested in Russian securities or ADR has traded overseas and things like that. Yes, we're going to continue to monitor, especially stay alert for any cyber risks or any other market functioning risks. But I think that's that's that's what our role is and then to ensure for our three part mission investor protection capital formation and then that in the middle, the fair orderly and efficient markets. Sounds good. Let me ask you about crypto, which is part of your purview, I guess, increasingly and something you've been considering a lot lately. I know last time you were on with Yahoo Finance, the prospects for a spot Bitcoin ETF came up and you had a lot of questions about how investor protection would work there have your concerns been alleviated is approval coming, do you think. We at the SEC are technology neutral, but we're anything but public policy neutral and so this investment class, a little less than $2 trillion of assets, a valuation in crypto currencies, if you wish, or crypto tokens, Bitcoin and all the other tokens is a is a highly investable asset at this point in time, many tens of millions of people around the globe have chosen to put some of their savings into this space. And so it's every bit is important to have investor protection for crypto exchanges for the lending platforms where people are transacting, buying and selling crypto tokens and have appropriate disclosure about the tokens themselves and protect the public from fraud and manipulation. And that's that's really what we're looking at. And yes, as you said, the SEC has a role to play other agencies do as well, but the SEC has a role to play because Congress painted with a broad brush. And if you're raising money from the public, the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities laws, and it's it's kind of straightforward. And I remember saw that that was an opportunity to mislead the public to sell a to sell a shame transaction to that the public could make a decision the basic bargain the public gets to decide on their investments, as long as those promoters raising money are giving full and fair disclosure. And there's basic laws about protecting against fraud in essence lies about what's going on. And sort of following up there, you also told us that you hope this this year crypto trading exchanges.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,47,2022-10-26 17:09:01
4167," would come within the public policy perimeter. Yeah, look, we had just a couple of weeks ago, working with one of the larger lending platforms, where a platform was taking money in, it's public, it's BlockFi, 600,000 or so, retail accounts and institutional accounts, people putting their crypto assets at risk with BlockFi, BlockFi then saying we'll give you a return on an account. And we were trying to bring those parties in, in that case that was, they were not following the securities laws, the securities laws, investment company laws and the securities act laws. So does that mean though that the exchanges will come under SEC regulation, strictly speaking to you? So it's just, just do a little bit of probability here. I'm sort of a math guy. I was when I was a kid, my identical twin brother and I, you know, that's kind of who we were and everything. But these platforms often have not just dozens, but hundreds or thousands of tokens on their platforms. And these tokens back to the securities laws, many of them, without prejudging any one of them, many of them may well be securities. Probabilities or that these platforms, there's 10 or 15 large platforms, these crypto trading platforms have 75 to 5,000 tokens on them, probabilities or they have securities on them. Our laws are straightforward. We're supposed to register as an exchange where people are buying and selling those securities. And yes, many tokens, many crypto tokens have been found in the past to be securities. And I'm not trying to prejudge any one token, but probability weighted. There are many of these tokens on these platforms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,48,2022-10-26 17:13:32
4168," you you both so what's the probability then if you waving a wand and saying okay you guys are now I don't think you the law is clear yeah the law is clear it's not about waving a wand congress talk about this in 1934 they amended these laws multiple times since over nine decades and a platform that has securities wanted is in exchange it's question whether they're registered or they're operating outside of the law and I'll leave it at that Are you concerned chair gensler about the decrease in the number of public companies in the US and I know there's arguments about how extreme that decreases nonetheless that is there look fewer today in the were 20 years ago and then the fact that private companies grow into deck of unicorns and our great investments perhaps but they're unavailable to ordinary investors they're only available to the people on sand hill road and how that might be exacerbating inequality in this country so I think that we have vibrant capital markets this hundred plus trillion dollar capital markets that are kind of the envy of the world frankly I think anyone who's honored to be in the role I'm in as you said Andy the 33rd chair and there'll be others you know for decades to come in this great agency well central to our roles as chairs past chairs and future chairs is to ensure that we continue to be the envy of the world that we have the leading capital markets and we have a vibrant public capital markets and vibrant private markets we are taking up a lot of projects here at the SEC about those private markets to bring greater transparency greater efficiency if we have more efficiency and yes competition in the middle that's better for those private companies whether they're small startups or the unicorns and it's better for the investor so we're trying to drive efficiency in the middle we're also trying to drive for greater transparency particularly as it relates to financial stability risk emanating maybe out of hedge funds and the like so we've got a lot of projects driving competition and transparency but part of part of our markets is both public markets and private markets speaking of the envy of the world what is the future of Chinese stocks listing in the United States does the SEC have a role or a position in this situation one way or the other so we do so we're blessed in the US again with such robust and strong capital markets that between 1,500 foreign companies actually list their shares here in the US it's not just China companies but a lot of Europeans Asian South American African Australian company it just from all around the globe but there's some basic understandings that if you want to list in the US you need to comply with our investor protection rules and one of the key things that came out 20 years ago one of the key things was that if you want to be issuing and raising money in the US that you have to be not only audited that the company has to be audited but the auditors have to be open to inspection kind of simple idea audit the auditors and Paul Sorbaine's a Maryland senator who I had the honor to work with chairs sorbaine's past that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,49,2022-10-26 17:17:46
4169," who I had the honor to work with, chairs, sorbains, passed that law 20 years ago. Bipartisan with Republicans on the Hill, which Senator Mike Oxley and with President Bush. 20 years later, 50 plus jurisdictions around the globe have allowed US entity called the public company accounting oversight board to audit the auditors, but China has not. So Congress weighed in again two years ago, or year and a half ago and said, no, that's not right. And they put a clock that had to happen. So where are we today? I think it's really, we've had some good discussions with our counterparts from China, the public company accounting oversight board has had some good discussions, but it's really up to the officials in China. If they allow the auditing firms in Beijing and Shanghai and elsewhere to be inspected and that their work papers are actually shared and not with a lot of redactions, but actually shared. And their auditors actually allow themselves to be, give interviews and testimony like 50 other countries have done. Right, then there's a path forward. Otherwise, Congress has spoken about 250 Chinese companies in this three year clock, potentially as early as 2024 would have to suspend trading here. Another proposal on the works is specifically in response to last year's meme stock craze. I believe it would shorten the amount of time it takes to clear trades. How would last year have played out differently had that rule been in place? So the events around the meme stops or as you know, the game stop led to a review by the SEC and we came up, the staff came up with four areas we should take a look at. And we have in two of those areas put out proposals too, we've working on some more. So one is what you talked about is the basic plumbing. Shortening how long it takes for money to move and stock to move. It's called settlement period from two days to one day. We've also done something around transparency around short selling and made a proposal last week around that as well. Shortening the settlement cycle lowers the risk in the system as the old saying goes, time is money. Right now if you do a trade on a Monday, you don't move the money or the stock until Wednesday. You shorten that to Tuesday less risk. In the middle of that January, the faithful January around the game stop events, a number of online brokers and broker jobs said we can't let retail public access the market. And that's just that access to the market is so fundamental that part of the issue, part of the issue was this settlement cycle thing, but it's not the only thing. And as I say, we have four projects we've proposed to, the other two looking at really the equity market structure itself and payment for order flow and the dark pools of capital that are flowing without transparency. That's a major project that I'm hoping staff will make recommendations and we'll move forward. And lastly was this thing called gamification or what we've come to call digital engagement practices. The Wall Street Journal is reported the SEC is looking in recent sales by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his brother Kimble, whether they violated insider trading rules. I know you can't comment on a pop. I'm glad you said that for your viewers. I just hope that you're where you're heading. Oh, that's so I'm going somewhere. I'm going somewhere to your against look. All right, I know you can't comment. I'm gonna be able to comment. On a possible investigation, but have you talked about the need for stronger insider trading rules generally?

It is login Rapid browser str playback DVD.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,50,2022-10-26 17:22:15
4170," is insider training a problem that you're focusing on? It is. It is from our enforcement side or terrific enforcement efforts headed up by director of gray wall, Sanjay Wadwa, the whole team, just terrific team. But it's also from the policy side, we've even done something about insiders. When can corporate executives sell their shares and there was something put in place about 20 years ago, which was called a safe harbor, if you might. And we came on board and thought there's too many gaps in this area that the in-senior management might be trading stock when they're in receipt of material non-public information. And we put this proposal out in I think was December or so about these so-called 10B51 plans. And so both from really vigorous enforcement, but also from the policy side about insiders, we're taking it up in both ways. And I think it's a really important part because it comes out of trust in our capital markets and trust that there's a level playing field that when you're in the markets that somebody doesn't have an information and banage from material non-public information.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,51,2022-10-26 17:26:46
4171," What are your feelings about the debate on Capitol Hill right now about lawmakers being able to trade stocks? My understanding is that SEC employees have pretty tight restrictions with some stocks being off limits and trades needing to be pre-approved. Is that fair? I mean, should it be the same for everyone in all different branches of the government? I'm going to leave that as you can imagine to Congress to think through or certainly or willing and able to give them technical assistance on that. The stock act that was passed about 10 years ago by Congress and set certain reporting obligations on members of Congress and also certain limitations as well, we as an agency actually have a role to play in that stock act. And that's ongoing discussions I know up on Capitol Hill and wherever they come out, we stand ready to help implement our part of that if they change those laws. And finally, Chair Gansler, other recent SEC chairs, including Jake Clayton and Mary J. White came to the job for more of a legal background. You worked as a banker at Goldman once upon a time ago. How has that background and the insight you garnered there changed how you approached these issues and running the commission? Is it any different? Well, I'm honored to be in this job. I mean, the then president-elect Biden asked me to do it. It's one of the greatest honors of my life. I got up there with my three daughters, I guess, with my three daughters, maybe higher honor. And the wonderful woman I was married to. I would say this. I'm the fifth chair of those 33 that is a non-mawyer from the first chair, Joe Kennedy, the president Kennedy's father, Arthur Levin, William Donaldson, some really, really fantastic chairs. Look, we all come with different backgrounds, different perspectives, different experiences. I come with a deeply markets background. I really believe in markets. I think markets are a critical part of our economy, but regulated markets. I think that the laws put in place in the 1930s in this eight, nine decade period of the SECs that what Franklin Delan Roosevelt laid out and many really wonderful people at the SEC and on Capitol Hill, too, have augmented is we've enhanced economic growth because when you enhance trust, this basic concept that if you investors get to decide, but they get full and fair disclosure and we're protecting them against fraud, that the exchanges have to register, but there's a basic rules of investor protection and this three-part mission to facilitate capital formation investors and the efficient markets in the middle. I think that's a really great bargain. Now, for me, I've also had the great honor to share another agency. So along with Mary Shapiro, Mary and I are two people that have shared both the commodity futures trading commission and the SEC. So, it's great to talk to my former chairs. There's eight, I think of eight or nine now that are still alive and I call them on a regular basis, I check in and there's just a terrific, terrific group of commissioners, my fellow commissioners, Alison Lee, Hester Perst and Caroline Crenshaw. So, and we all bring a little bit different skills and perspective and we bring it together. Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. You've been watching Influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. We'll see you next time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,52,2022-10-26 17:30:45
4172," awe Welcome back to Yacht Finance. I'm Brian Sazzi here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Smith mixed action in the markets on this Wednesday morning on the beak of back beak back of weekish earnings reports from tech giants Google and Microsoft. At least right now we're seeing the Dow up about 91 points the S&P 500 Nazx slightly in the red. Here's what we have on tap for you this hour. The Google pullback RBC's Brad Erickson stops by for a take on Google's less than stunning quarter and outlook and maybe not so playful holidays but tells serves up a mixed outlook through the economic slowdown will chat shortly from tell CEO Inan Kriz. And the newest meme stock leader Bed Bath Beyond gets a new CEO sort of will have the details. But first over to an S for right at the Wi-Fi interactive. And this yeah Brian and we're taking a look at new home sales for the month of September because we just got that data that came in new home sales fell 10.9% to 603,000 that's an annualized rate. Now that did come in though higher than the expected that what economists had been expecting. Remember that in August we saw a surprise to the upside for new home sales. September though was a month where you had the mortgage rates rising by more than 100 basis points. So that is expected to impact the slowing housing market and why do we talk so much about the housing market. Well because as housing goes so does the economy there are many jobs that are linked to the housing market there are durable goods that are linked to this. Let's take a look at XHB that is down 3 tens of a percent but it had been down the home builder ETF more than 1% before this data came out. But I just want to point out the year to date chart here you can see the losses for the home improvement and home builders taking a look at where we're at with the sectors we are seeing technology that is lower right now. We're also taking a look at consumer discretionary that's lower and this has to do with big tech which has been reporting earnings. Starting reporting earnings yesterday with Microsoft and Google both down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,53,2022-10-26 17:35:31
4173," Also taking a look at consumer discretionary that's lower and this has to do with big tech which has been reporting earnings started reporting earnings yesterday with Microsoft and Google both down more than 7%. You've got meta which will be reporting that's down 3% and you've got Amazon down 4% guys. Yeah, finance is on a nest for a over there at the Wi-Fi Interactive thanks so much for tracking all that and that's appreciated. And a dip in YouTube advertising weighed on the search giant but with its scale and diversified tech portfolio is it positioned to weather disruption in the digital ad space joining us now to discuss and weigh in we've got RBC capital markets Internet equity analyst Brad Erickson pleasure to welcome another Brad into the chat here. So first of all, first of all, you take away from alphabet here, especially considering some of the different parts of the business. I mean, this is still 79% and advertising based business here. Yeah, that's right. And I'll do my best. Brian, I got to tell you I'm still reeling from how on earth you spend 48 bucks at Chipotle, but let's let's not Google since that. I'm here for. Yeah, it was a tough quarter all around. They they missed top and bottom line relative to the street. And then I think the Q4 commentary was particularly ominous. They spoke to seeing a basically broader pullback in ad spending within that business. And then surprisingly, there's no layoffs at Google. Apparently they're actually adding employees half the rate that they have been. So it's a little bit slower, but I think that caught people by surprise as well. And so you're seeing earnings estimates in particular come down enormously here this morning and obviously reflecting that in the stock. I want to ask about YouTube in particular. Is there something that Google can be doing alphabet can be doing with YouTube that it's not doing? Or is this is it just sort of subject to competition from TikTok, for example, plus the macro environment? And are there more levers that can pull there? Yeah, I mean, I think there's a couple of drivers, right? First and foremost, YouTube, because it is a social platform and does rely on third party measurement through IDFA, right? It was exposed to the Apple downturn. So there's absolutely been headwinds there. And I think, you know, they've somewhat abated from a year over your perspective, meaning we've lapped them. But I think there's probably still a bit of leakage going on there and then sure, competitively, we all know TikToks over the last TikTok over the last year or two has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the room for those in the social space. And so, you know, one of the comments management made last night on the call was. Someone asked about whether the the mix shift they were seeing or sorry, the short form video, the YouTube shorts increased usage if that was incremental to YouTube or if it was a mix shift, and they kind of insinuated that it was a mix shift. And so that's your sort of evidence that TikTok is continuing to have an effect on that business going forward, you know, performance max is their product, which basically, if you don't know where to spend, be it search or YouTube or elsewhere, performance max is an AI tool that allocates your spend automatically. We do think that's going to be super important as they start layering spend into YouTube shorts. YouTube ad spend, I'm monetization in YouTube shorts, but that's still early days. And so that's probably not going to show up in the numbers till until next year. Brad, how severe do you think these cost cuts will be at alphabet? Well, to date, I mean, like I said earlier, they're we're not really seeing evidence at least directionally of cost cuts, right? Like they said, they're going to from a net ad perspective for headcount. They're going to cut that in half, but that means they're still adding roughly six, 7,000 employees quarter of a quarter, which is a, which is a lot of heads. I think as we get through to next year, the CEO kind of reiterates some other comments previously around trying to try to squeeze out more efficiency on a per head count basis. So clearly they're pointing to more cost efficiencies there. But yeah, I think people are a little concerned that that pay these guys are seeing a downturn. They're speaking to it qualitatively here going forward. And that's not being referred.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,54,2022-10-26 17:39:30
4174," But yeah, I think people are a little concerned that, that hey, these guys are seeing a downturn. They're speaking to it qualitatively here going forward. And that's not being reflected in the cost base. Now, flip that. Maybe let's just take devil's advocate for a second and say that's positive. It could reinforce the view that maybe Google is just viewing this as a temporary transitory type of thing. A lot of confidence in the business longer term and they don't need to go there. So you could argue it both ways, but certainly for today and where margin estimates are going, it's a negative. And on the hardware side, it doesn't seem like they could even afford to lose out on an install base that they would see come in from the number of phone devices or smartphone or handheld devices, even with a waiting PC market, even with some of the slowdowns and add. It seems like they would need to continue to produce, regardless of what the margins would look like on that side of the business. Yeah, I mean, hardware is obviously a tertiary part of this model, but it certainly popped up or flared up, I should say a little more in the quarter, with the launch of the Pixel 6A. Obviously that has a normal cost of billi-materials and gross margin profile for hardware product, which is substantially below the ad revenues. And so that weighed on the model to some degree in the quarter. But I don't expect that to be sort of a sustained headwind as we move forward here. So. RBC Capital Partners, Internet Equity, Analyst, Brad, Ayrx and good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. You as well. Thanks. All right, before we head to break, we have to check on shares of BedBath Beyond after the company now in Sugof, well, soon the role of CEO after serving as interim CEO for four months. This comes in the middle of an attempt to turn around the brand following several quarters of slipping sales and really a very long period of operating losses. You can see the stock down slightly today about 3%. Intel's mobile ice spin-off gets a disappointing IPO valuation Julius Beck with today's top headlines next. The",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,55,2022-10-26 17:44:04
4175," Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Intel is set to debut itself driving unit mobile eye at $21 to share during its anticipated IPO this according to the Wall Street Journal. Now price represents a premium from its expected range, the unit which focuses on driver assisting and self-driving technologies like sensors and microchips comes both as driving aids become increasingly critical to portfolios automakers and as the market for public debuts continues facing the dry spell I should say it's above the range that was reported or is originally being below the initial range. So I guess it's somewhere in the middle. The shape of shakeup continues at water brothers discovery the media empire announcing that James Gunn and Peter Safren will be the new co-heads of DC comics which oversees iconic properties like the Batman and Justice League franchises. This after reports that the company had taken a write-off of up to $4.3 billion on canceling projects like CNN Plus and Batgirl as well as layoffs across the WBD company. And an Apple executive has confirmed for the first time that the company will comply with the EU's mandate for mobile devices to use USBC this during a tech event. The EU standard was enacted to help consumers simplify charging and cut down on e-waste Apple senior vice president marketing didn't give away any more details on the commitment. It said the company would have approached the problem differently. The company had previously remained mum about whether it would honor EU regulations over the charging standard Apple first introduced a lightning port in its iPhone 5 it's not officially hinted at what might place that port. Sauce? All right let's check back in now on the broader markets as the Fed juggles the balancing act of Kermit inflation and a verdict a recession. Where does that leave investors seeking to balance the two risks for more on this we have BlackRock's Tony Disparito. Tony good to always get some time with you. I think let's start on the today's market action because I think what we're seeing is pretty interesting you know Julie highlighted earlier on the show some pretty not good quarters from a Microsoft and Google yet stocks are hanging in there are we watching the bottoming process in markets take place. Yeah so I think look there's some short term and long term drivers here and certainly if you kind of look year to date you know the market has gone down dramatically and all of it has been multiple contraction right we've gone through a multiple that was 22 at the beginning of the year to about 1617 today meanwhile earnings have mostly picked up although they're starting to roll over and the market's dealing with the risk of a recession so from my perspective I like the valuation I think the valuations have come back down to the normal range I'm still concerned about earnings and that's what we're seeing is a as a bumpy ride with respect to earnings and I see more volatility in the short run because if you think about the Fed the Fed just started hiking in March of this year seven months ago and that was a 25 basis point hike by the way and when you think about Fed interaction with the economy those rate hikes typically take at least six months to have any impact and the full impacts felt more like 18 months down the road so we still haven't felt the full impacts of those rate increases that's going to impact economics that's going to impact earnings and so I still see some bumpy ride ahead and I think what investors should do is prepare their portfolio to be more resilient all right so within that bumpy ride who is sitting on the wheel or who's sitting in perhaps the most insulated part of the bus as we're continuing to watch the Fed and for their mandate them trying to meet some of those benchmark expectations for some sectors they're going to experience this a little bit harder than others as we've seen both pullbacks and consumer discretionary real estate's been hit hard and then additionally you mentioned tech a moment ago yeah so I think an active manager can really add value here both through industry sector as well as stock selection and I kind of look at the world in terms of sickle goals and more stable learners I think there's value to be added on both sides in terms of sickle goals in the fund I run were really favoring energy and financials as they both benefit",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,56,2022-10-26 17:48:12
4176," I think there's value to be added on both sides in terms of cyclicals. In the fund I run, we're really favoring energy and financials as they both benefit from the inflationary impulse. Certainly energy that's a long history there and then on financials you have the benefit of rising short-term rates, expanding net interest margin. And then on the more stable side, I'm really in favor of healthcare. Healthcare is certainly as stable as utilities and staples historically from an earnings perspective, yet has a better long-term growth dynamic and the valuations today are significantly more compelling. And so that's how I see the opportunity to add value for investors. What about a place like technology? I mean if you talk about stable earnings, I mean even though it's slowing the earnings growth from many of the companies that we heard from late yesterday, it's so relatively stable. So I wonder how you thinking about that group? So I do think that there are real pockets of technology where there's real good opportunity. And I'd even put it in that stable bucket, kind of a new staple if you will. And that just because there's a recession, it doesn't mean you can slow down on your techs that. Right? And so we're still seeing cloud grow. It's growing a little bit more slowly than maybe it has historically, but it's still growing by leaps and bounds, 40% plus in the quarter as we look at recent reports. And so I do see really clean balance sheets and technology. So these are things we're emphasizing. The clean balance sheets, the companies that have more stable like earnings. And then you got to be look at valuations. Make sure you're not overpaying for that collection of good business with good earnings power. Tony, you mentioned energy in that sector. We've already seen this have composed some of the best performers year to date. So is that trade already missed? I don't think so. And for a couple of reasons, there is a long term supply demand mismatch there. And the mismatch is really coming from restrained supply. You know, that sector went into, I'll call it a recession back in 2014, where there was significant excess capacity. And since then, you've seen CAPEX come down dramatically and stay down. And that's really important. And so when you look at companies today, even with high oil prices, you're not getting that supply response. And in fact, you're seeing good discipline out of OPEC, right? They just cut and you know, saying look, the economy is slowing. We need to cut supply. And then also when you look at the strategic petroleum reserve, right? We've been releasing about a million barrels a day, that's 1% of demand. Doesn't sound like a lot, but in the market like oil, that's normally very steady. 1% means a lot. And so we're about done with those releases come December. And so that's going to be another thing that's going to put a floor under price. Tony, I appreciate the time here today. BlackRock, Tony Disparito joining us this morning. Thanks so much. Thank you. Coming up, Microsoft shares. They are on the move, but lower by about 7% here. After its cloud revenue came in short of expectations for the first quarter. 5% there's Brent Braseland joins us next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,57,2022-10-26 17:52:35
4177," MUSIC Microsoft beat on the top end bottom lines yesterday, but the company's guidance fell short after the company reported software than expected cloud revenue. CTO, excuse me, Satsun Nadella, says that cynical trends are weighing or cyclical trends are weighing on the stock's consumer business, but could the company's plan to moderate expensive boost its stock joining us now to weigh in? It's probably percent there's internet equity analyst Brent Braseland. Brent, great to have you here with us this morning. For Microsoft, some of the larger headwinds that they had laid out, FX, PC, which of these do you see actually being able to abate in the near term of all of the headwinds that they mentioned and how can Microsoft successfully navigate the spirit? Sure you bet. So clearly, you know, you're starting to see kind of the macro pressure start to erode into the growth outlook for Microsoft. If you look at the cloud business, it actually is still pretty healthy, slowing, but we still expect the cloud business to grow north of 20 percent this year, a little slower than we thought originally six months ago. It's really the more economically sensitive parts of Microsoft. That's still a big business. That's still a $100 billion business. It has been growing across windows and PCs and surface devices and gaming. That's a $100 billion plus business that has been growing 4 percent plus for the last two, three years. It could actually decline double digits this next quarter. So it's really, that's really where we're seeing that the slow down in those more cyclically sensitive areas, more of the consumer areas, the commercial still holding up pretty well. So that's sort of in line with what we've been hearing from what the commentary we've been getting ahead of the earning season from the likes of a sales force, for example, that have seemed to indicate that business spending is holding up pretty well. But how long does that last? If the cyclical stuff is rolling over, can we expect it at some point to also affect the more enterprise spending? Absolutely. And you're just now starting to see small cracks in the cloud growth rate. If you look at Azure, it's one of the fastest growing parts of the cloud business for Microsoft. That growth profile is decelled by about 9 percentage points in about three quarters. So you absolutely are seeing slow down. It's still a good growth, right? 37% in constant currencies with the guided to this coming quarter. That's down from 47% over the last couple of years. So it's slowing. We're seeing signs of maybe some budgetary pressure on the enterprise side. That's going to flow through into next year as well. So we certainly wouldn't say enterprise software.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,58,2022-10-26 17:56:58
4178," Maybe some budgetary pressure on the enterprise side. That's going to flow through into next year as well. So we certainly wouldn't say enterprise software, cloud is immune to the macro. And we're now starting to see cracks. Brent, clearly a challenging quarter for Microsoft. Outside of your coverage universe or outside of Microsoft, are there other companies that you think will be impacted to the same extent as Microsoft? Sure, we actually took numbers down on 22 stocks last week, including cutting numbers by Microsoft by 3 billion. Clearly wasn't enough. We took another $7 billion cut to our Microsoft numbers this morning. But yeah, we think there really isn't a safe haven in software. I think the macro pressures will eventually impact growth rates for most of the enterprise software names that we cover. So I think the good news is valuations are starting to bottom. So I think there's no longer a valuation risk. The challenge fundamentals have not bottomed yet. So we still have a bottoming process to go through on the fundamentals side. We need to see growth expectations for next year reset. And we're getting close. But certainly have to go through a fundamental trough before you start to see stabilization. What type of growth profile would you give at this point to Microsoft's cloud business, considering the pull forward and demand that we had seen over the past couple of years? Yeah, so it's interesting. We look at the broader cloud market. The cloud 100, if you will, growth was 33% in 2021. We're modeling about 22% cloud industry growth in 2022. That's similar to where Microsoft cloud is at. Next year, we're actually sub 20% growth for industry. About 19.5% industry cloud industry growth expectations. That's essentially, I think, directionally where Microsoft's headed as well. High teens growth in a recessionary environment seems like a good kind of landing spot for this industry. That's down from 33. So that is a material slowdown, but still really good growth for industry that could be north of $300 billion in 2023. With valuations sitting where they are right now, do you think that Microsoft, especially within this cloud landscape, needs to make a key acquisition and strike while the opportunity might be there to go after a company that could help it grow out of its portfolio in the cloud a little bit better? Listen, Microsoft's still the cloud king. It's the only cloud company north of $100 billion in revenue. It's still kind of growing. Poise to grow 20% in consequences. So could they do more? Absolutely. Should they do more? Absolutely. Do I think they will do more? Absolutely. So $17 billion in cash, $65 billion in cash flow. Microsoft's not done from an M&A standpoint in cloud. We expect them to be active next year. Absolutely. Times three. Thanks so much, Brandon. Appreciate it, Brent Braseland, a Fiper Sandler equity research. Appreciate it.

4179," Testing Teeing up, good news. You'll get that in a second. Raymond James, the most recent analyst, Oplod, AT&T's recent quarter. Take your simple tea with a boost to strong buy from Alp performance after the U.S. telecom reported its third quarter numbers last week, including a net gain of 708,000 pre-paid subscribers joining us to talk about the company. And the economic environment is Jen Robertson, AT&T, mass markets, executive vice president and general manager Jen, thanks for being here. Thank you. So as we look at these subscriber numbers, what I'm curious about is where they are coming from. In other words, are they coming from your competitors, which competitors, and what is it costing you in terms of promotions? Yeah, you know, we're really proud of the subscriber growth we've been delivering and we're sitting at nine quarters now in a row of 600,000 post-paid voice net ads or more, and delivering near-record levels. So it's been an exciting time to be in the industry. Proud of how we're standing up against competitors, 2.000,000 net ads year to date through the third quarter and expecting that to be an industry leading position as we move forward. So holding strong there, and certainly delivering that from a higher demand for connectivity, it is a resilient product. And looking at customers and delivering value. And so, yes, there are promotional offers, but we are meeting customers where they want to be. We have distribution expansion that's occurred. We're meeting customers where they want to shop. A lot of trends that came out of the COVID pandemic that have carried forward and changed how people want to interact with us. And we're proud of how we've simplified our product and pricing construct and met customers where they want to be. When you think about the advancements in the network, too, one thing that we've heard over the course of this earnings season from telecommunications and communication services companies is where those investments are being made and boosting up the network. Where how soon do you see that beginning to really play out for so many of the customers that you're serving, too? Right. So we've made investments, significant investments in the 5G wireless network, proud to be moving towards 130 million subscribers and customers that will be covered with our C band spectrum by the end of this year, 200 million and more covered by 5G. And certainly the country's largest investor in fiber. And so putting those investments there because it's the connectivity that customers want, it is the technology that will meet the next decade plus of demand for customers, both on usage and on speed. And so that's why UCS is really doubling down and putting our focus in those two network technologies. It was talked a lot about in the earnings call, Jen, just improved value perception. So what are you doing specifically on pricing? You're cutting prices of plans. You have",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,60,2022-10-26 18:05:37
4180," from my phone full and fair disclosure and 5G for me doesn't pop up everywhere. What is it like on your service? Do you still see dead spots for 5G? Yeah, I think it comes back to we deploy the spectrum in phases and that takes time. And so you'll see 130 million people covered by the end of this year with our 5G C band where you'll have a noticeable speed. You know, just lastly what we have here, we think about the areas of the economy that have like these little luxuries that consumers will continue to buy in even during an economic downturn is your phone service, your cellular service. Is that a little luxury that you're seeing people continue to spend higher for just because of all the different things that we use our devices for on a daily basis right now too? Right, I think what we see it is it's not a luxury, it's a requirement. Customers need connectivity for personal use, for business use, for learning and commerce. And so it's actually a very resilient product and customers are purchasing up. It's why our RPU was up in the third quarter. All right, let's see what they are. Jen Robertson, AT&T, Mass, Markets, EVP and General Manager. Good to see you. Thanks for coming to our studio. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right, coming up we'll chat with Mattel, CEO and not cries as the toy maker. Here's up for the peak holiday shopping season. We'll be right back. Here's up for the peak holiday shopping season. Shares of Mattel are in focus after the toy maker trimmed its full year guidance in its third quarter earnings report last night saying market volatility and other macroeconomic risks has forced it to reformulate its expectations. But tell Chairman and CEO and not cries joins us now to discuss. No, I know he's great to get some time with you. Your top takeaway on the quarter. Thank you, Brian, for inviting me. Well, this was a good quarter from Mattel. With the ninth straight quarter of year of year growth in constant currency. Look as you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,61,2022-10-26 18:12:21
4181," Fighting me. Well, this was a good quarter for Mattel with the ninth straight quarter of year of year growth in constant currency. Look, as you know, we are in the midst of a challenging economic environment, but our year-to-date results of double-digit growth in net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS showed that we are successfully navigating a complex landscape and our strategy is working. We believe a fundamental is a strong and we are very confident about our multi-year growth trajectory. And Anna, I've been covering you and the turnaround story Mattel for a good bit now. I wasn't used to that tone on that conference call last night just highlighting some slowing you're seeing in the market. How severe is that gun? Look, there's no, it's not a secret that the economy, the broader economy is currently challenging, but our year-to-date result do show and do demonstrate that we are on the right track. We are maintaining guidance for full-year growth in net sales in constant currency of 8 to 10 percent and look forward to the holiday season. We modestly revised our profit expectation to allow and accommodate for the inflation that we're seeing, but we still expect a growth year for Mattel, both at the top line and the bottom line, and also expect 2023 to be a growth year, both top line and bottom line. So we are very confident about our trajectory, brands are resonating, thriving with the continued engagement and cultural impact, and we're very confident about our strategy and execution. You did highlight the need that there might be a little more promotions in the holiday quarter than I think a lot of investors may be expected. How much discounting do you expect to be doing? Look, according to date, consumer demand is a non-with expectation and we're pleased with our performance. Shoppers are returning to traditional purchasing patterns closer to the holiday and we expect demand to accelerate. We are working closely with our retail partners to meet the anticipated demand. We have more advertising and promotion. We secured more shelf space and retail support compared to last year and we also expect to and also we have great holiday toilies representation and much stronger in stock. So yes, we are going to increase activity, promotional activity, but we are well positioned for the fourth quarter in the holiday season, which is why we are maintaining a full year guidance of net sales growth in 8 to 10 percent in constant currency. No, I'm old. I'm not as close as I used to be. What are some of the top toils in the holiday season? Well, Mansahai is going to be a very exciting offering as we prepare for the global launch next year. Hot Wheels Car Wash, Lightyear products, Fisher prices, a great musical toy called Bouncing Beats and the Dreamhouse, of course, will always be on the top of the toilies for every holiday season. So an exciting broad offering across a pretty large spectrum of product that we're very excited about. I remember having one of those car washes as a kid. I've got to send your photo exists somewhere, but these are some cool toys. That is an interesting stuff. How is the pricing on these compared to last year? Do you plan to take more pricing? Look, we increase pricing in the second half of this year. We were able to successfully implement those increases and it's too early to tell, but so far we haven't seen a meaningful impact on consumer demand. Important to say that as it relates to inflation, we are beginning to see some improvement in the course of ocean freight and materials. We expect inflation to moderate in 2023. And in addition to the savings that we're looking to generate of 250 million dollars by the end of 2023, we expect the combination of pricing and cost savings to more than offset cost inflation and contribute to margin expansion over time. So we are proactively managing our business in this environment to ensure that we are set up for long-term success. You may be the first to you that we've talked to to really highlight a peak in inflation and things cooling off a bit. I certainly, surely that is a good to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,62,2022-10-26 18:16:23
4182," Sure that we are set up for long-term success. You may be the first CEO that we've talked to, to really highlight a peak in inflation and things cooling off a bit. I certainly, certainly that is good to hear in a different tone. Let's go on to Barbie, because Barbie's been an interesting story the past year or two here. A real growth mechanism for the company. What's on tap for that brand next year? Oh, very confident about the long-term growth trajectory of Barbie. Barbie was the number one global-doll property in the third quarter and year to date. Year to date Barbie is up, which is an excellent achievement when compared to last year, which was the highest on record for Barbie of all times. We look forward to next year, which will have an exciting innovation pipeline, new content slate with Netflix. And of course, the highly anticipated Barbie movie, our first theatrical release that will come out this summer. Also important to know that Barbie doubled in size over the past five years and was the number one global toy property overall, not just in dollars, but overall in the last two years. And we really see that as a proof point to the strength of this incredible franchise, very confident about Barbie and proud to have it as our leading franchise. It does seem like a nine. And we've talked about this in the past. You've all the seeds that you have planted in terms of content. And of course, you highlight the Barbie movie or now coming to fruition. This will start to hit the market next year and beyond. How much will you spend on content next year? Well, we employ a capital-lite strategy. We're not spending money on content. We're leveraging our brands. We collaborate with the best filmmakers and content creators out there, both not just film, but also in television, and partner with major studios to create, produce, distribute and commercialize our brands on the big screen and also in episodic content. We have a very exciting slate of 14 additional movies other than Barbie that we currently developing with some of the best and most prolific creators of this generation. And this is going to grow because we have more in the pipeline that we haven't announced. And likewise, Mattel television is thriving with 12 series and specials that will be on air this year, so to speak, because some are actually by streaming. Eight of those are new for a returning. Months-to-high-lab action television movie musical, just launch an ecology and we grinlit the second movie. And we continue to roll out more content, such as Thomas and friends, polypocket, fireman Sam, DeepAin and Oop, more Barbie product, Pictionary Gameshow, and the list goes on and on. So exciting to see how our brands resonate with consumers and attract creators to collaborate with us, because like us, they're also very excited to reimagine and create an expression of our product in content. Once the Pokemon movie hitting it on. Well, we licensed recently the Pokemon brand, which is one of the strongest franchises this year for mega, for building sets. It's been a great driver for us, and we're very proud to work with the Pokemon company in expressing their IP in combination without product. So it's a great partnership. And this really speaks to how we elevate material to become the partner of choice for the major entertainment companies, and where we bring our capabilities, our global scale, our innovation, our supply chain and commercial capabilities, collaborate with other owners, other franchises, and take them to the next level and create evergreen franchises, just like we do with our own. And I'm just being flagged before I let you go. And there was just a new Pokemon movie, Detective Pikachu. That's how you know you're getting old, but you do not realize those types of movies are in the market. We'll leave it there for now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,63,2022-10-26 18:20:43
4183, in flag before let you go and on there was just a new poking on movie uh... detective peaked through that's how you know you get an old but you do not realize those types of uh... movies are in the market believe it there for now good luck this holiday season to tell CO non-cryze will talk to you soon thank you so much are coming up with your own some more key earnings reports from visa haliburn and sketchers looking forward to sharing that now so that's next uh... welcome back every one of this time for a couple times four stories today when we're going to start with this visa tracking ticker symbol v on the day it's up about five point six percent right now this is after beating on q3 earnings the payment company says it still sees strong consumer spending payments volume at group ten percent in the quarter while transactions grew twelve percent and this comes back to the type of spending that consumers are more prone to do it this one time leaning towards some of the car products and card services out there versus just saying yeah pay with cash that trying to hold on to some of that cash for yeah and all this travel that worth talking about right how are people paying for that they're you know they're putting on their card so that again this this is the idea that we're not seeing across the board everything slowing down at once right it is very uneven here in visas results i think are a good example of that american express good quarter last week visa could quarter i'm not surprised well and on the travel for as you mentioned american press had cited global travel or corporate travel uh... especially given that american express has so much of the corporate tn that they kind of account for within that landscape of the visa that clearly plan out for them to alright haliburn so earnings double in the last quarter as demand for crude oil increases we need to upgrade from most far protect with sent which is sending shares higher the bank upgrade the stock from underweight to overweights so pretty simple analysis here all prices up good quarter for haliburn you know it's a conceited,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,64,2022-10-26 18:25:20
4184," the bank upgrade, the stock from Underweight to Overweights. So pretty simple analysis here. Oil prices up. Good quarter for Halberd. Yeah, although it's not always as straightforward as that, right? You need the demand for oil services as well, not just the increase in oil prices. I mean, the price chart get jump on, coming from Roger Readover, Wells Fargo, is pretty impressive to $52 from $33. So he's looking for a lot more upside. So are a lot of investors. We speak to, right? We just talked to Tony Desperado over at BlackRock. He mentioned energy as an area that he likes right now. And he's not the only one. Even after the climb that we saw in energy stocks, especially in the first half of the year. Yeah, I mean, it's really a story as well, though, within all of this up pricing. Their pricing increased in North America and international markets. They're saying that the strength of their strategy and action was really kind of resulting in this revenue growth of 6% sequentially there and really led by some of that pricing and the macro environment right now too. On the other end of the spectrum, we have sketchers, the footwear manufacturer seeing shares dipping today after missing third quarter estimates, give a down-be outlook for the current quarter, the shares are 4.5%. And I'm seeing a lot of analysts concerned being expressed over the margins and the target for margins as well for sketchers. So again, here, illustrating the lumpiness in consumer spending, right? People maybe you're traveling. Maybe people are buying some shoes still, but they're not buying as many sketchers and it's costing the company more to get them out there. And maybe to move them out the door too. Inventory of 21%, right flag. But it still comes back to the core consumer that sketchers is going to go after here. We've seen them move more into some of this sport or leisure activity category. They've got a number of PGA tour some now live golfers, I believe, that are still on their roster. And so with that, it's this larger question of when you've got a millennial and Gen Z population that have clearly shown what their brand and their identities are. Nike, Lou Lemmon, and then additionally Crocs, as well as one of the kind of growth areas that we've seen in some of the more kind of comfortable shoes. Where does sketchers sit within that too? I think that's a larger question that the brand is still going to have to answer for. All right. Now we're looking at Wingstop. Shares a Wingstop taking flight today after the fast food chain announced prices of bone and chicken wings are actually decreasing. The falling price is prompted. Wingstop to raise its full year gone. And so this is what we've heard for Wingstop in recent quarters, deflation and chicken win prices. Really one of the only fast food companies that I can think of actually seeing deflation in parts of their business, Wingstop benefiting from that. They just got into the chicken sandwich game. Madly. That's the analysis. Yes. Well, they may be seeing deflation in chicken wings, but they're probably not seeing deflation in labor costs, right? I mean, that's something I think that is still we're seeing upward pressure on that across the board for anybody within the food business specifically because people still don't want to come back and work in that business. No, it's true. And at the same time, where Wingstop is also still trying to navigate with that direct correlation or that direct touch point with the consumer is, while many of those consumers have options on the table to get delivery through some of the other third party sources as well for their chicken wings. However, falling chicken prices help them that out. All right. We are seeing a stock sound mix right now. And coming up at Kiko Fijita, we'll continue our coverage of earnings from Tech Giant to Alphabet and Microsoft with technologists research president Bob O'Donnell. Keep it right here for that. 5K is worth saving is worth it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,65,2022-10-26 18:29:41
4185,"ending Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Big misses for big tech, the results season serves up some uncomfortable questions for the global economy underwhelming reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Texas Instruments all winged on sentiment this morning. Too strong for too long. The greenback, the dominant currency for most of 2022, but a broad move against the dollar takes place in global effects. So the question here, are we at peak hawkishness? We're going to ask global X ETFs, Morgan Del Done later in the show. And in this economy, Intel's mobile I price is its long awaited IPO above the targeted range. Could stripe an Instacart V-next. We're going to get into that conversation later this hour. First though, as always, we are checking the markets right now. 90 minutes into the trading day right now. The Dow is up about 240 points. The Nasdaq, the big one we're keeping a close watch on on the back of those big tech reports. Of course, we're going to be breaking down Microsoft as well as Alphabet, meta on tap after the belt today when we're going to be watching closely, taking a look at where the bond markets are right now. We have seen a bit of a pullback here, but the shorter end still well above that 4% level, five year at 4.2. And the benchmark 10 year just right about at 4%. Well, shares of Alphabet are sliding into the red app for missing estimates on the top and bottom line. The tech giant's revenue growth slowed to 6% from 41%. The prior year is at spending continues its downward trend. Lapping from a strong third quarter last year, for some tough comps across Alphabet's portfolio, including search and YouTube. Take a listen to what we heard from Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat on the earnings call. Joining us to break this all down, we've got Bobo Donald, technical.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,66,2022-10-26 18:34:08
4186," We'll continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year on year growth rates of advertising revenues. Joining us to break this all down, we've got Bob O'Donnell, technologist research at President Chief Analyst for more on the impact tough companies are starting to feel from an economic slowdown. Bob, we've got you in the flesh. I'd so great to be back. Live in the studio. It's crazy. Certainly a good day to break this all down. We're going to start with the alphabet because you know we were saying before the show that it's interesting to see how significantly they were affected, especially in digital ads. When you think about the last quarter, there's a bit of a divergence between the social media companies. Alphabet has a bit more of a diversified portfolio but they weren't shielded this time around. No, I mean because obviously alphabet gets searched and we're always going to search and people are always going to do that and so they always have that that they can fall back on as part of the advertising side. But the social media side and the YouTube side of things, that's where they took the hit and that's because we're seeing obviously overall advertising going down in those places. And the other challenge that you've got with alphabet is it's not really that diversified a company, right? There's so much dependence upon advertising. I mean, look, they do have Google Cloud which you know they didn't really talk too much about that but they have a few things that are bubbling up but they're still small. I mean, I saw the other day that you know other bets. Remember when they used to talk about other bets it's 0.3% of the companies revenue. So I mean, I think that's one of the ongoing challenges. They're going to figure these things out. They are building their business not only on the enterprise side. I should say not only for Google Cloud but also Google Workspace, some of their other services where they compete with Microsoft and that's been growing and that continues to grow. And before it becomes a huge contributor to the bottom line but you know there are these elements that are in play and that are moving forward for them. What was your takeaway though from what we heard in terms of where things are headed? I mean, it seemed like they were sort of setting things up for an even more significant downturn. And to your point, yes, it's not as diversified as a company like Microsoft but in terms of where the ad revenue and where they compete in, it is a little more diversified than the likes of Meta or stuff. Yes, no, it definitely is. And look, I think what we're seeing in a lot of ways across tech is a sense of the things that people expected to happen at the beginning of the pandemic didn't and now they kind of are. It's sort of like it's a two and a half year delay of the big impact that people thought was going to have. You know, I think in general we're seeing that tech companies having weathered so well are now facing the challenges that other parts of the market have faced. And it's just that's the reality. Growth is going to slow down. And on the advertising side, of course, that's a reflection of overall macroeconomic trends. And there's not a whole lot they can do about that. And I think that's a challenge. Obviously, there's not many more places they can go. I mean, Google is everywhere and there's stuff is everywhere. So it's really going to be dependent upon how the general macroeconomic does so that those companies then feel more confident, their advertisers, as I should say, feel more confident in spending the money with a platform like Google. Let's talk about Microsoft. Obviously, Azure has been the big growth driver there. And you have said in your notes that because it is more enterprise-safed facing, they are a little more shielded. And yet what we heard yesterday, I think it was on the call from Google saying essentially, yes, companies are still investing in the cloud, but they're taking a little longer and maybe thinking a little harder about how much they want to invest. So are we likely to see further headwinds for Microsoft, even if Azure is the driver? I think we will, and the issue is it's easy to forget that only about, I think the last numbers I heard were 15 to 20% of companies have moved their workloads to the cloud. I shouldn't say of companies, of the potential workloads. And so there's still this huge potential upside to move to cloud computing from all the big platforms. And the other thing to bear in mind is we've had these incredibly strong growth rates for cloud computing across the board, AWS, obviously, Microsoft. And at some point, you can't last, right? It's the law of big numbers. You run into a certain point where it's very difficult. The thing is, even as things start to slow down a bit, a lot of companies started big initiatives during the pandemic that are cloud computing base.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,67,2022-10-26 18:38:06
4187," Very difficult. The thing is, even as things start to slow down a bit, a lot of companies started big initiatives during the pandemic that are cloud computing-based, and they are going to continue those. Like you said, as the commentary said, some of those projects are going to slow down a little bit. They're not quite as high priority, perhaps, as they were, but they're still going to do it, because it's still part of these companies really kind of trying to transform their businesses, and that's an essential part of survival, in the next decade. We're still waiting on numbers from meta. We've got to alphabet or Amazon, and Apple later on in the week. It's sort of interesting to see how the narrative around tech has changed, because for a while, it was about the social media companies, and yet when you think at where we are in the current court, it feels like we're going back to these established players, so if we can call that, it has come down to Apple, it comes down to Microsoft, and how are you looking at your portfolio of those tech names, and where are the safe bets? Yeah, no, I think we are falling back to the most trusted tech brands, and the big names are going to be the ones that are going to, I think, well, make it through this. The other thing is, again, these companies over the years have become increasingly diversified. Now, in the case of meta, I think it's a challenge, right? Obviously, very advertising focused, a very consumer-based advertising focus, so likely it's going to be tough. Apple, everybody loves to say, well, one of these days, something's going to catch up to Apple, but what Apple magically manages to do, every quarter, is somehow get different elements of the puzzle to add together. There have been rumblings that iPhone 14 sales, for example, have been lower than expected, so they've apparently cut the production, and so people say, oh, we'll see, iPhone's going to be down, but remember now, that iPhone is less than 50% of the revenue, they've built up this huge install base, they continue to sell services, right? Everything from Apple TV and all the other services they have, that's driving their growth. They're also doing more, obviously, with AirPods, and the watch, and other elements of their ecosystem, so they've managed to create this, I think, pretty diverse story, similar to Amazon, right? I mean, Amazon is very dichotomous. You've got AWS, which just cranks out revenue and cranks out dollars, and then you've got the online sales business, which realistically is probably going to take a hit, and it's going to be like any of the other retail environments. But the question is, is there enough on the AWS side to offset some of that? It's hard to tell for sure, but again, it's that story of diversification that these big tech companies have done over the years, and I think we're going to start to see the benefits of that, but clearly at more of a reduced kind of a normal rate, not the huge multiples that they've gotten. Yeah, a lot of investors are going to be parsing those numbers or breaking down those numbers closely. Bob, great to have you in studios, right? Thank you, Kiko, great to be here. Bobo Donald, Technologist Research, President and Chief Analyst. Well, macroheadwinds, no doubt taking a toll on corporate results. So we've been talking about an underwhelming numbers for big tech, pointing out some glaring weaknesses in the global economy. Major data points held above water for some time, but it's a slowdown we've been fearing so long, finally here. We've got an S for A and Julie Hyman. Julie, making an appearance on the internet. I'm going to shout out. Let's start with the earnings, because we just went through the big tech ones there, but there's another one that I know in as you've been watching, that's Texas Instruments. Yeah, that's right. And Texas Instruments is important because their chips go into everything from home appliances to missiles. So the scope of where their chips go is very significant here. And Texas Instruments basically saying that they are seeing softness, especially also going into the industrial segments. So that industrial segment that seemed to be immune to sort of a softness in the chips pace, a slowdown in chips pace, that is notable. Now, analysts have been talking about that we would see a slowdown in the chips pace, especially in the second half of the year. But again, that scope, you also have, of course, the Biden administration restrictions when it comes to chips and China, that's also weighing on here. But the bottom line from what I can glean from this is that, basically, this slowdown that we're seeing, it's not going to be a quick turnaround. Julie, your thoughts on that? Well, it's interesting what's going on with Texas Instruments. It seems like everything's slowed except autos, is what analysts were pointing out. That was actually a bright spot, because that's a spot where the automakers are sort of in an arms race, where that is concerned. So for me, the takeaway is that this is very lumpy. And this is something we were talking about in the last hour.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,68,2022-10-26 18:42:29
4188," where the automakers are sort of in an arms race where that is concerned. So for me, the takeaway is that this is very lumpy. And this is something we were talking about in the last hour. Not just within chips, but within everything, right? Because if you look at results from something like VISA, which was out with its numbers as well, from there, the indication seemed to be that consumer spending is still relatively strong on things like perhaps travel, right? So it's not that businesses and consumers are not spending. It's that spending is on different things. They're spending perhaps less, maybe overall. Certainly companies seem to be judging by the results from Microsoft, for example. But it's not sort of across the board, things falling off a clip. It's this sort of lumpy slowdown. But doesn't that go back to sort of like, how do we look at what the macro picture looks like, right? I mean, we've been talking so much about how there's this divergence between where consumer sentiment is versus where consumers are actually spending, and that it, yes, there are concerns about higher prices. And yet, when you look at sort of the broader labor market, things are still pretty tight. And this sort of seems to add to that idea of being a little noisy and trying not being able to have a very clear picture on where things are headed. Yeah, definitely. And if you also look at the home data, for example, I've been also watching that because as housing goes, so does the economy. This is another area where we are seeing September, new home sales were down in September. And you saw also in September the mortgage rates, those climbed up to by 100 basis points. That's huge amount in one month. So now it's just sitting just around 7%. You are going to see a slowdown in this. In the housing market, we are already seeing it. And keep in mind, the housing is a lagging indicator. So when we're talking about these different areas of the consumer, how the consumer feels, where it's spending its money, housing is a huge component of the economy. It encompasses so many jobs from construction to mortgage lending. And then it also encompasses the durable goods. So diswashers, everything that has to do with building a home and what you put inside the home. I think that there's different areas, as you mentioned, of the economy. It is a little bit lumpy. And it's just which areas do you want to focus on? And which are lagging, which are the ones that indicate? Well, in going back to what we've been learning from earnings, when Chipotle is kind of an interesting story, they raise prices a lot of companies have to offset the cost. They did beat expectations. And yet it does seem to suggest that there are trade-offs that are happening among consumers. Well, and they talked about the lower income consumers are not coming in as often. Transactions actually fell at Chipotle by a percent. They're going to fall by a higher percentage in the current quarter, according to the CFO Jack Carton, when we spoke earlier today. And so not only are you getting lumpiness among what consumers are spending on, there's a lot of differentiation amongst consumers. So whereas a higher income consumer might still go out and spend a house, even though a buy house, maybe they're spending less on that house. Likewise, you're going to have a big differentiation between higher and lower income consumers and what they're buying, where they're traveling, et cetera. Well, even that, even if the lower income customers aren't coming through the doors much, higher income, maybe spending more. Even for higher income, that is a trade down, right? Yeah, it could be. Definitely, if they're buying Chipotle and not capital grill, I don't know. I don't know where they live. I'm not sure. Right, exactly. But yes, there could be some decisions being made. And we know that inflation impacts the lower income consumer as well. So that is expected. These are, I mean, we've seen it with other, with even the dollar stores and the previous earnings, where they show where consumers are spending. And there may be not spending on the t-shirts. There's now spending on food, on the consumable products. Yeah, something we've heard from other retailers to groceries over other businesses. Good to have both of you on. Thanks. And that's Fraying Julie Heimann. Well, coming up, I, on the prize of Fed Hockishness is peaking. Does that mean the IPO market can get back to its feet? Intel's plans for autonomous driving units should help boost sentiment that discussions on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,69,2022-10-26 18:46:45
4189,"... Well, balancing act Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter slated to close this Friday. Bloomberg reporting that the Tesla CEO confirmed that in a video conference with bankers funding the deal, the timing they'll making some people nervous with less than two weeks to go until the midterms. There are growing concerns about social media companies and how well they're equipped to handle disinformation and content manipulation. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance, Alexis Keenan, who's following that story for us. And to number one, we're looking at this timing potentially a little clearer if it closes on Friday. How quickly, that's a big if, how quickly can Elon Musk move to change the platform as some have speculated he would? So I've heard some legal experts say, and whether they're the right ones or not, but they say it could happen immediately. Look, it's going to be a private company. He could turn this thing on a dime. So this makes it a very interesting and delicate time really for Elon Musk to be taking over this company because you do have midterm elections coming up November 8th. And these companies, social media companies, Twitter and the rest of the major US companies, they're all tasked with having a really robust content moderation policy around leading up to elections and after, certainly that's been an expectation ever since the report came out, the Congressional bipartisan report in 2016. So also though, Musk is working to sustain demand on the Tesla side. So he's got to balance this, but also he is having to keep that demand up with Tesla stock being down since the acquisition about 31%. And I'll tell you why in a second. But first let's hit the fact that neither Tesla nor Musk have responded to explain exactly what is going to happen with content moderation on Twitter once and if the deal really gets done here, that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,70,2022-10-26 18:51:18
4190," Let's have responded to explain exactly what is going to happen with content moderation on Twitter, once and if the deal really gets done here, that deadline being Friday at 5 o'clock, though Twitter has for its part in August, reaffirmed its position, its policy is called the civic integrity policy. And what it does is it offers prompts to users that direct them to information that the company deems accurate and it also adds labels to content that it deems misleading. So that policy in effect, but maybe not so much after Friday. But also it's been raised by some of the legal experts I've been talking to concern about Musk straddling not just the work responsibility of SpaceX, Tesla, his other companies and then bringing Twitter in, but really trying to manage and be the arbiter of what lives and doesn't live on Twitter. When it comes to world leaders, we've seen in the past a lot of discord about labels that have been put on lawmakers content, both in the U.S. and abroad, that's still going on recently with lawmakers in Ukraine, in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And so does Musk want to be in that position? That's a question that I hope he answers soon. It's going to be a difficult balancing act once he is faced with those decisions. You have to wonder what his feet is going to look like, too. I mean, you're talking about global leaders. He has sort of meddled in or weighing it, weighed in on what happens with Russia-Ukraine. He gave that interview with the Financial Times where he talks about what should be done with Taiwan. When you are leading that very platform where the discussion is happening, you know, sort of do the rules change. And the larger question everybody keeps asking is, what does it mean? Those people who were kicked off the platform like Donald Trump, are they going to instantly be reinstated? We don't know. But yes, it could end up being a problem that Elon Musk doesn't want to handle. And yes, could he push these responsibilities off to others who are running the company? Sure. But at the end of the day, the buck kind of does stop with Elon Musk so long as he is the sole owner of this company. We'll have to see how it plays out, but certainly he's going to have to continue to try to curry favor in China, in Germany, and other places where Tesla is operating and make sure that he's pleasing world leaders, people of power on the content moderation level. And we don't know for sure that he wants to be the CEO and he's going to be running. We do not know. All to be determined there. Alexis, thanks so much for that. Well, Intel's self-driving car unit, mobile I, priced its initial public offering at $21 a share, late Tuesday. That's above the $18 to $20 range. That values the company at roughly $17 billion, more than the $15 billion until paid for the company back in 2017. But a ways off from the $50 billion valuation it sought last year. Let's bring in Yahoo! Finance is Dan Halley who's been watching that for us and Dan, you know, there's a few questions that come with this. Number one, given where the IPO market has been, does the fact that Intel prices at a higher range suggest the appetite is back there again? Yeah, I think that's really the big question for this kind of listing, right? This is mobile I, just to give you some background. This was a company that was originally developing technology to be able to provide computer vision for self-driving cars. Obviously, it's gone. Heavy into self-driving, Intel picked it up some years ago at around the $15.3 billion market. Now, as you said, according to these reports, IPO is being priced at $17 billion. But that's below, again, as you pointed out, that's $50 billion that was originally being looked at. And this all has to do with just the IPO market kind of falling off after a big 2021 big 2020, big 2019, where we saw some of these mega companies, and hit the public markets. Now, we haven't seen very many that are doing a billion dollars more in their IPO or more in their IPO. We have mobile I hear barely touching a billion dollars. But I think it does point to some interest in this kind of company and the long-term growth perspective, for something like this, where there is still a lot of work to be done in self-driving cars in computer vision when it comes to vehicles. And so if mobile I go public and can get some clients under its belt, then I think that just means that the opportunity really is there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,71,2022-10-26 18:55:23
4191," in computer vision when it comes to vehicles. And so if mobile I goes public and can get some clients under its belt, then I think that just means that the opportunity really is there for growth. Now, when we talk about self-driving cars, obviously, the discussion ends up pointing towards something like a Tesla, GM. What those companies are offering really are just drivers, system technologies. It's not really self-driving, no matter what they companies call it. It's just still drivers, system technology. So the self-driving will still take years to kind of shake out. So there are ample opportunities for companies like mobile I to kind of really fully establish themselves in the space and they become really the main client for some of these larger automaker brands and see where they can bring the technology going forward. Dan Halley is always seeing on top of the big tech stories for us today. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, Green Champions, California, leading the charge on clean tech and sustainable innovation. But the question is, are those investments being made in an equitable manner? We're going to hear from one man who is ensuring that's the case at least in Los Angeles.

4192," you you... Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live I'm Sean the Svith alongside Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed. On the Saturday that we are seeing today has to do with the tech earnings that we got out after the bell yesterday. Take a look at the Dow, though, just barely in positive territory. You can see the tech side. We take a look at the NAS Agnazdeck composite off just around 1.8% NASDAQ 100 off over 2% today and that tech side also reflected in the S&P. You can see the S&P all about 7 tens of a percent on track to snap a three day win streak taking look at the bond market action very quickly years. We see a bit of a risk off sentiment in the market today. You can see yields pulling back just a bit off 9 beast points just above 4% now. Let's take a look at some of the biggest of climbers inside the tech sector. We have to look no further than Microsoft and and alphabet. You can see Google there off just around nearly 9% drop today trading just above 95 dollars a share pulling up Microsoft. That's off just around 7% this afternoon trading at 2.33 a share and just about an hour from now we're going to be getting results from meta taking look at how meta is trading this afternoon ahead of those results. That's off a 6% a lot of that has to do with the results that we got from Google yesterday the fact that we are seeing such a pullback in ad spending obviously huge concern here from meta ahead of those results. To you look at the sector action across the board they're selling obviously intensified in communication services and technology sectors both of those sectors off 2% and 3% respectively on the flip side energy holding on to gains this afternoon up just around 1% of the health care and material state. Google's worst day since March of 2020 we talk about that time period an awful lot these days. Shana thank you let's get you up to speed now on housing again seeing the impact of higher rates. Mortgage demand fell last week to nearly half of what it was a year ago and it was lowest level since 1997 that's according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The driving force once again the 30 year fixed rate now increasing to speed. The number of the numbers on Thursday up from 694 we could go and now at their highest level since 2001. That was the time a guy named Harry Potter was debuting in theaters for context. Refies down 86% year over year. Well demand for adjustable rate and mortgages or arms as many call them continue to increase more than tripling from the market. The number of the numbers that are in the market is in the market. The number of the numbers that are in the market is increasing from earlier this year. Now over to a raise. We're going to get us up to speed on some moves in energy. Hi, Des. Hi, Dave. And we're watching today oil as it has been rallying WTI up more than 3% branches up more than 2%. A couple of reasons for this is light dip in the U.S. dollar and oil is invoiced in dollar. So that's why you're seeing this bump. Also the U.S. posted record high exports. That's why with WTI, we're going to be in a few more days to be able to see the market. So that's why we're looking at a rally here as well. Taking a look at natural gas prices. A little bit of a bump. But take a look at a one-month chart. Because you see the market. And we're going to see the market. And we're going to see the market. And we're going to see the market. And we're going to see the market. And we're going to see the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,73,2022-10-26 19:04:13
4193," why with WTI, you're looking at a rally here as well. Taking a look at natural gas prices, a little bit of a bump, but take a look at a one-month chart because you can see natural gas down 17% over the last month. In fact, I'm going to pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see the action here, this downward trend. We are expecting some warmer weather in the next couple of weeks. It's a part of the reason why you're seeing a little bit of this price movement. But also, in Europe, we're seeing a downward trend with natural gas prices there as well because of milder weather because their inventories are now, their storages are full and also because demand is down as well, guys. I don't know, thanks so much for that. Let's talk about the broader market action this afternoon. A lot of that has to do with the selling that we're seeing in tech. And really talk about the key underlying technical factors that we need to watch for the rest of this earnings season. For that, we want to bring in Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies, Founder Katie. It's great to see you. Let's first start off with Alphabet. Having the worst day that we have seen in quite some time, you can see right now trading just above $95 a share. I know you have a chart really looking at the technicals of this $95 a share. What do you think of Google at this price? Well, you know, when you see a gap down, it's obviously a step back on the chart. But it's surprisingly not doing too much damage to our indicators. The indicators are designed to reduce the noise and the indicators are actually treating this gap down as noise. You're not seeing any kind of breakdown with the gap just given the oversold bounce that preceded it. So I would say that it could be worse when we might take away. And now if we saw Google or Alphabet and Microsoft get back above, there's summer lows. That would be nice and incremental positive for them. Or viewing any kind of stabilization on the back of this as within the context of their long-term downtrend. So the bear market cycle still very much has a hold on most of the mega caps and of course major indices. Katie, you mentioned Microsoft. They're down more than 7% largely on the back of a bit of a miss on the Azure cloud growth. Let's zero in on your expectations there. Yeah, it's really the same chart to be honest in it. And it's maintained a fairly high positive correlation to Alphabet's chart. You'll notice there to a gap down but not a breakdown. There is some support risk at the recent low. That is still very much intact. There's also additional longer term support around to 15 for Microsoft based on if they're not she replacement level. It's not as if the client is making the bottom drop out for these names. It's really just sort of more of the same in terms of the downtrends that have been enforced here to date. And we suspect that they're actually going to recover here in the near term. And we say that more because the top down influences as opposed to something specific to those stock themselves. The positive seasonal influences are very prevalent at this time of year. We also have or came into the earnings season with this sort of deeply and widespread oversold condition. And that's why the vast majority of the reactions outside of Alphabet and Microsoft have been more positive than not. So that is something that could foster greater relief rally and give us at least better selling off. OK, we have Microsoft and Alphabet the two big reasons why we're seeing the SMP in the red today. We have the SMP off just around 8 tens of a percent on track to snap that three day winning streak. When you take a look at the current value of the SMP just above 3,800, where do you think we go from here? Looking right up into that down trending 50 day moving average and that was sort of a natural place for it to take cause that we wouldn't expect it to go up strongly every single day. It already lifted more than 10 and a half percent off of it three-cent low with this oversold balance. So we've been calling for a few days of consolidation as of yesterday. And that's based on short-term overbought conditions primarily in some counter-con signals on a very, very short-term basis. But we're looking for that consolidation before it's higher for us resistance that has been taxed of initially is around 3914. And beyond that, we're watching the down trending 200 day moving average, which we would not be surprised to see a test of before this relief rally fully fail. Okay, Katie, how about the current seeks to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,74,2022-10-26 19:08:26
4194," that we're watching the down to the 200 day moving average, which we would not be surprised to see a test of before this relief rally fully failed. Okay, Katie, about the currency exchange, obviously the US dollar, the strength of it, the story for many, if not all, multinationals in Q3 without before a little bit of a pullback in recent days. What's your expectation? Very strong long-term up trend, of course, behind the dollar, and that up trend still does have the support of positive long-term momentum indicators just look at long-term moving averages. They're all pointing higher and mostly diverging still. And yet within that context, we had noticed a few weeks ago some signs about the exhaustion that we hadn't really seen since about April, looking at the dollar index. And the signs of exhaustion were based on the Denmark indicators. Those are designed to gauge what a trend seems to be firing out a little bit. And that's what seems to have happened here for the dollar. We're looking for more consolidation, more of the same that we've seen recently for the pullback and consolidation. So basically regulate the slope of that very steep up trend. Can you take a look at the price of crude today? Again, getting that bum like a nurse was just telling us about a lot of that has to do with the data that we've just gotten out. But taking a look at how crude has been trading. We have it up on your screen there. When you take a look at the right hand part of that chart, really, in the month of October, we have been pretty ranged by between this 85 and 95 bucks of barrel. What do you make of the prices that we're seeing today? Yeah, it's a little short term momentum shift. The upside we've seen already an oversold bounce that was partially retraced now coming out of that pullback. I do think that we'll see a relief rally unfold as well and food greater degree in crude oil prices, also natural gas prices. But there has been of course a long term loss of upside momentum that we've seen that with a downturn over the past several months. And that is certainly notable shift for crude oil. So we have to assume that this relief rally may meet resistance a bit lower of course than the earlier highs here. We're looking for resistance. We discovered somewhere in the 96 to $97 for barrel area. But those energy stocks really don't seem to be bothered whatsoever by the downturn that preceded this relief rally. They do not. All right, Fairlead Strategies, Katie Stockton, always a pleasure, always learning. Appreciate your time. Elon Musk making an appearance at Twitter headquarters. See, posted this video on Twitter moments ago. It comes just days before his $44 billion deal to acquire the social media platform is supposed to close. There is a court mandated deadline on Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern for Musk to take ownership. Bloomberg reporting Musk will speak to employees on Friday. And he's already tweaked his Twitter profile calling himself Chief Twitt, Shana, which is well, pretty appropriate. You can see shares up just over 1%. The question is, how do you address those employees? He is not a master communicator, though clearly one of the brilliant business innovators of our time. This is a tenuous time inside that building, at which they already know about the paperwork suggesting 75% of them will be out of the job. Yeah, you would have to guess that he won't exactly receive the warmest welcome from so many of Twitter employees. Taking a look at an email that was actually sent out by Twitter's chief marketing officer, who sent the employees there. She was saying that Elon is going to be in the San Francisco office this week walking the halls, trying to dive in and really realize the important work that you do. Feel free to say hi. She went on to say if you see him in the hall, I don't know if people are going to be too eager to see Musk in the office. I mean, there's so many questions that remain unanswered, especially when your job is potentially on the line. A lot of people are anxious, and I think people want to know exactly what the vision for Twitter is and remains to be seen. I guess how long we're going to have to wait to see what Elon Musk is going to actually do with them. And how he's going to make money, start by broadcasting that live on pay-per-view. I don't get you. We would all pay our five bucks to watch that address. All right, we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live coming up.

And celebrated, chef and restaurant to a Wolfgang puck tells us what he's cooking up for the holidays and the state of the restaurant industry around the globe. Ahead. I'll take care for you. We're watching shares of mobile eye the first major tech eye PO of the year this stock up roughly 36% right now in its first day of trading after pricing a $21 share of the self-driving software company going public after spinning out from Intel which acquired mobile eye back in 2017 mobile eye now valued at roughly $17 billion dollars which is just over the 15.3 billion purchase price but far below that $50 billion valuation Intel was targeting for the offering earlier this year but again popping in its public debut today up just around 35% not bad especially given the tech route that we're seeing today. Yeah good news bad news indeed Hawaiian Airlines taking an earnings hit in the third quarter the company reporting a $9.3 million loss but some light ahead. COVID travel restrictions out of Japan are easing Hawaiian Airlines CEO Peter Ingram says this sets the stage for a full restoration of the airlines network in the coming months the best dress CEO of the business joining us now always good to see you sir strong earnings from American and united in Delta had expectations up what were the biggest headwinds for you?

4196," So what were the biggest headwinds for you? Well, we really did see some mixed signs across our business. We've had a very strong recovery in our North America to Hawaii markets, which is the biggest part of our revenue generation. Really, there's no question that's been back for several quarters. Holding things back a little bit is our two parts of our network. One is neighbor island, where demand is actually strong, but we've got a competitive situation with low fares in that part of the network that are suppressing financial returns. And then Japan, in the third quarter, wasn't fully recovered. It's going to take a little time to get back. The good news is that at the beginning of October, they have removed some of the pandemic travel restrictions in Japan. So the environment is really set up now to have a more robust recovery over the next couple of quarters. And Japan is the biggest source of international visitors to Hawaii. It's very important to the market and important to us. Peter, you touched on the competition there from a local competitor aggressive pricing. And you also talked about this on the earnings call last night. What are you doing then to compete because they are offering fares at very, very low prices? Well, we're matching the fares on many of our flights. So we've got pretty broad availability of those discounted fares. But on top of that, we offer a broader and deeper schedule. We really want to focus on delivering impeccable service to our guests. We've doubled our Hawaiian miles that we offer to our guests to reward our loyal passenger. So we're going to make sure that we give people reason to fly Hawaiian. Whatever the fair price environment is, we want to make sure that when people have a choice, they choose Hawaiian. As they have for 93 years traveling between the islands. So we're no stranger to competition. And we're just going to face it head on. Yeah, $39 fares. That's a burger and a beer in New York City these days. The deal with Amazon, how significant and investor story is that? And can you tell us more about the option to acquire up to 15% of your stock? We're really excited to be able to announce this agreement with Amazon. It's been in the works for a number of months. And it's great to be able to talk about it now. It really means a couple of things fundamentally for us going forward. One is that it's an avenue for growth in the years ahead. And so it really opens up a new channel for us to grow the business in a little bit of a different way. And it also helps us diversify our business. This business with Amazon won't be facing the same risks and challenges that we have in the passenger business. That doesn't mean it's risk-free, but it is a little bit of diversification, which is good when you're dealing with the ups and downs of an economic cycle. So we're contracted now to fly can air planes for on behalf of Amazon. We'll be flying between airports that are near their large distribution centers. Most of this will be on the US mainland. Some of it is likely to touch Hawaii over time. And there's an opportunity to grow beyond that. And it's up to us to perform and deliver impeccable service and to operate on time. So Amazon chooses to pick offs to do more of their flying going forward. And JPM, JP Morgan calling it a game changer here for your business. Peter, when you take a look at staffing, and I know we've talked with you about it in the past, the pilot shortages, what you're doing, what that currently looks like for your business. Have you seen any improvement? We've really seen some good traction being gained here in terms of being able to staff up. We've been hiring pilots and flight attendants and other employees throughout the year. In terms of pilots right now, we're able to recruit the pilots we need. And part of that is because we've got a lot of wide body aircraft. And wide body aircraft are at the end of the day, what pilots get paid the most to fly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,77,2022-10-26 19:21:24
4197," Part of that is because we've got a lot of wide-body aircraft and wide-body aircraft are at the end of the day what pilots get paid the most to fly. So we've got a pretty compelling economic proposition. We've improved a lot in terms of being able to recruit mechanics and airport employees here in Hawaii. That's been a tight market, but we're moving along. And over the course of the whole year, we're up to close to 1,500 positions filled. And that's at a company where our total employment is about 7,200 right now. So a lot of activity from our recruiting department and they're doing a good job, but it is a dynamic market. You've got to make sure you've got a compelling proposition and that you've got a company that people want to work for. And that's something we're really focused on making sure that we're an employer that is a desired destination in a competitive market. Peter Ingraham, always great to have you. Thanks so much for coming on after earnings. We hope you join us again in next quarter Peter Ingraham CEO of Hawaiian Holdings. All right, coming up next, Chinese tech stocks are bouncing back today. We're going to discuss whether it's time to buy some of these names next. So Apple adding a new text to its App Store. Some sees another direct shot at Facebook parent meta. Tech reporter Dan Howley here with more on this story. Dan, what are we learning? I'm sorry. That's right. Apple is essentially forcing or enforcing its in-app payment rules on Facebook parent meta. In particular, this has to do with when people make purchases to boost some of their posts on the likes of Facebook or Instagram. Those were not being processed through Apple's App Store payment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,78,2022-10-26 19:25:55
4198," make purchases to boost some of their posts on the likes of Facebook or Instagram. Those were not being processed through Apple's App Store payment system. And so Apple wasn't getting any revenue out of that. So now they're saying that, look, other companies do this like Twitter and TikTok. So now we're going to enforce this with Meta. Now this comes as the two companies spar, continue to spar rather over Apple's privacy changes that it made to iOS, which is really smacked Meta as far as ad revenue goes, as well as Snap, by the way. And also comes as Apple talks about how it's going to be increasing some ads across its own platforms. Now when Apple talks about its advertising business, it talks about how it protects user privacy, how it doesn't collect user data, how you only see it in particular places. And that's its way of contrasting itself against something like Meta or other social media companies that will display ads for you from places that you may have visited online or through third party apps. So really this is kind of a continuation of the budding of heads between the two companies. And I don't expect it to end anytime soon. It doesn't look like it's going very well on Meta's side of things. The privacy changes have really struck at them and they continue to try to work through the Metaverse transition. So it's really hurting them more than it's hurting Apple. But part of the philosophy behind their desire to be a Metaverse company and behind that push that's costing them $10 billion a year is to get away from relying on third party hardware partners like Apple. So this is kind of their way of ensuring that if the Metaverse is the future, they can call their own shots. They don't have to rely on Apple doing things like this. Didn't let's talk about another big story for Apple today. It's going to comply with the EU's ruling that all devices are going to use the USB-C ports. Talk to us just about how costly this could potentially be here for Apple. Yeah, this is almost something that a lot of people were expecting to happen. We already have USB-C on the Mac. We already have it on the iPad. So it almost felt like a foregone conclusion that we would see it on the iPhone as well as its AirPods. The cases for the AirPods are still lightning-enabled. But they do offer the Beats brand that uses USB-C. So it's not as if this is something that is completely alien to them or anything like that. I don't know how much it will end up costing them. I do think that it is just another hardship for consumers, though, because all of those lightning cables that they have, they'll become useless once they have their new iPhones. So it really does become this, you know, unending cycle of, there's another cable. Now I have a whole, you know, rats nest of them in my basement. What do I do with them? Right? Right of them. So I think that's really what this comes down to. It does make more sense, you know, USB is universal. You can use it to charge your computer and your phone. It's just a shame that it took Apple this long to get on the USB train. I know, I already have way too many Apple chargers at home. Right. Even yeah, exactly. It's turning into a bigger problem. Right? I didn't have any. Thanks so much. Let's take a look at the broader market here, because the SMP back in the red today's big tech sells off Microsoft and Google leading it to the downside following their disappointing earnings results. You see the S&B off just around a 7 tens of a percent. Nasdaq actually up nearly 2% this afternoon. Here to talk about that and some of the broader trends at play. We want to bring in Tom Liden, vetifies, Smyshe Chairman. He joins us for this week's ETF report sponsored by Invesco. QQQ. Tom, it's great to see you. The slide that we're seeing in tech, I know you recently just wrote about ETF fun flows when it comes to some of those tech specific funds. What do you make of today's news and what do you think that's going to mean for investor appetite there? So when you look at the big picture coming out of the financial crisis, it was all about fang stocks, Microsoft, those tech stocks that really drove the S&P to, it was really tough to beat. No active managers could really touch it. Now in the last couple of years, S&P has been challenged and we're seeing more of that with these mega cap stocks being challenged in the market. What that does mean to is it's better for some of these actively managed ETFs. For the first time in 20 years, we're seeing active managers actually outperform some of their...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,79,2022-10-26 19:30:04
4199," Two is it's better for some of these actively managed ETFs. For the first time in 20 years, we're seeing active managers actually outperform some of their indexed counterparts that they're benchmark against. So that's good for the ETF business because active management has really made it in there. Number one, number two, there are also great opportunities outside the mega cap area. Outside the S&P 500 small caps in the last three months are up, almost 8% compared to the S&P that's only up 3%. So diversifying away from these big companies is important. And also when you look at small caps, just because of this strong dollar, multinationals are affected overseas. We know that, but there's a home country bias with small caps where they can buy goods and services overseas and do most of their business in the US. And then finally, quick shout out to stocks overseas. I mean, listen, those markets are challenged and in many cases in emerging markets, you've got multi-generational buying opportunities where there are single digit P's there and although it doesn't feel good, the currencies is working against you. If you've got a long-term outlook like you guys do, who are a lot younger than me, you could buy some now and just forget about it for a couple years, but you're not going to see buying opportunities with these low PE ratios that you see now. Speaking of overseas challenges that could to some represent opportunities, she's third-term and China hammered Chinese big tech stocks, Chinese stocks represented here, is there opportunities there in the ETF space? Well, Peter Lynch said don't ever let a bear market opportunity go unused or something like that. I'm kind of paraphrasing that, but it not only from a technical standpoint, a governmental standpoint, all the saber-addling that's going on, and then the whole delisting thing that's happening, that's really key and important. But we have to know that timeline is not the next three months, it's actually the next two years. So we've got some time for that delisting thing and the accounting thing to be worked out. And also with that being said, you look at some of these companies like Baba, they're not going away. And they're going to continue with all the online buying that's happening and going to continue to grow the fact that most of the citizens in China don't have laptops, they don't have desktops, they do everything off of their phone and all their buying and purchasing happens there. Their companies that are set up there to take full advantage of that. And the valuations have come down tremendously where you could buy some of these ETFs like KWeb, which is online buying China, which has just been devastated, price-wise. But the crazy thing is, shareholders are staying tough, they're not selling. Actually, some are doubling down because they see this as a buying opportunity. Time, you mentioned the strong dollar. Obviously, a huge head when we've heard about it from a number of CEOs who have reported earnings over the last couple of weeks, we've seen the dollar index pull back just a bit today. But when you see the strength of the dollar here, what do you think that needs just from an investment standpoint? And then if you're looking to capitalize on this through ETFs, what should people be doing? Well, as Katie said in the last segment, it's tough to find a trend. When you fight a trend, you've got to have some pretty big guts. Right now, with all the uncertainty in the marketplace, people are going towards safe havens, the dollars are safe haven for sure. And if we continue to see rising rates, Fed's pretty clear about signaling, which is a good thing. They're telling what's going to happen. And since they were pretty clear about that in May, all of a sudden, there's been more confidence in the market. We see from the advisors that were surveying regularly when they were selling bonds have now actually come back into the bond market because there's more clarity along with these advanced yields. So that's really, really good. What we can't count on is stability overseas. And that's the scary thing. But while there is an instability, ETFs like UUP, which in the Avesco Long Dollar, there's an opportunity that if you want to hedge against continued problems overseas with foreign currencies and instability in governments, that may continue to do well. That applies, Tom. Liden, I was good to see you, sir. Thank you, senior studio.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,80,2022-10-26 19:34:22

All right, investors are loving Wingstop this afternoon. We will tell you why after the break. This time for triple play three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading Netflix, Boeing and Wingstop. My play today is Netflix. Pivotal research once the biggest bear on the street when it comes to Netflix. Now on board with the streaming giant double upgrade there on the stock to buy a from sell and lifting its price started to a street high of $3.75 a share. That means that they think the stock is going to rally at least another 20% here from current levels. Pivotal research is bullish for a number of reasons those do include the net new subscriber growth number that we just got last week. Competitors raising prices, that giving Netflix an advantage. And they also say that the company is positioned in a relative strength position here and they're going to submit a major slowdown in digital advertising, which we have heard now from so many companies that have reported over the last week or so. Jared, so when you take a look at this stock, it has really bounced back over the last three months year to date though. We're still clearly in the run. Yeah, and let's take a look at the Wi-Fi interactive. This is the last three months, which you were just referencing and you can see we got lift off. Didn't even get that a couple months ago when we had that nice big August rally. However, you take a look at what's happened over the last 10 years. You can see how the stock gave back four years worth of gains in a matter of weeks, if not months here. And this remains a broken stock, kind of a show me story, along with many others in the tech sector until proven otherwise. And now I want to turn to the Dow where I am taking a look at Boeing. That stock is off 8.9%. This is a 10 year view. Let me just give you a year to date while I give you some of the details from.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,81,2022-10-26 19:38:52
4201," want to turn to the Dow where I am taking a look at Boeing, that stock is off 8.9%. This is a 10 year view. Let me just give you a year to date while I give you some of the details from this morning's earnings announcement. Now, number one, it's having its worst day since May, off nearly 10% at the lows today. And that's after reporting a miss on profits and sales. This is not helped by a $2.8 billion worth of losses and defense. And that's due to cost overruns on military contracts, including the refueling of Air Force 1. So you got to think maybe they're not hedging their fuel costs the way they should or maybe it's just in the contracts. Nevertheless, you can see these losses really varying by business segment here. Also we got some selling underway during the session after they cut their 737 delivery goals. And they said it may drop the 737 max variance unless a critical certification deadline in the U.S. is extended. We've seen these problems day before for Boeing. They just kind of happen in clusters. And you can see on this chart on the Wi-Fi Interactive, this is a year-to-day chart, didn't take out the May, June, July lows right here. So we do have a successful retest of that bottom, but we are heading down in a big fashion. And it's kind of reminiscent of some of those big down days that we had back when they had those original problems with the 737 max day. Going through the report, there is something to like, of course, the commercial unit. Revenue is up 40 percent and they delivered 112 planes. That's up from 85s, they're making some progress there, but they did cite continued supply chain issues through next year, is their expectation so clearly not out of the woods yet. My play, A Trending Ticker, on Yahoo driven by my stomach is always wing stop reporting earnings. Sales jumped 18 percent from last year, including a 6.9 percent increase in same store sales. The company's margins help by a 42 percent drop in the cost of bone and chicken wings from a year prior. Digital sales, a huge number, accounting for 62 percent of their sales during the quarter. CEO Michael Skipworth saying we've opened 167 net new restaurants through the third quarter on track to have a record year for restaurant development. Shares jumping 16 percent on this news, still though, down 9 percent year to date. Jared, the big question is boneless wings or are they called spicy chicken nuggets? Oh, you know what? I got to have the wings. I got to have the wings. Boneless wings. You call them boneless wings. Boneless wings. I do too. I do too. I don't call them chicken nuggets. No, but there's a big argument there. I'm guessing our own Josh J for is going to be in my ear momentarily. Sorry, Jen, do you mean Kate? No, I wasn't going to jump in there. They're not wings to me unless they have the bones in it. Okay. I guess you're on the other side of this argument. It's interesting though, Dave, when you take a look at this chart here because over the past six months, they certainly have seen a massive rebound in their business. Past six months, it's up 60 percent. And really, when you take a look at the commentary from the CEO on the earnings call when you talk an analyst this morning, he was really saying he was very sure and very confident in the business here over the coming months. When you take a look at the challenging environment, what that could mean for a slowdown, obviously, means investors are pretty excited and we're seeing that reflected in the share price today with the stock popping up what 16 percent. All right, well, it has been a tough day for tech stocks. I'm in disappointing earnings. But coming up next, we'll speak with one tech CEO whose company shares are climbing higher. 17",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,82,2022-10-26 19:43:17

Juniper Network's CEO, Rami Rahim, joining us now, Rami, good to see you, sir. What do we learn in the quarter? Well, it was a great quarter. We had record revenue for the quarter, record enterprise revenue. We had double digit growth rates in all of our strategic verticals, record software, record ARR. So, I'm delighted with the execution of the team. I think we've got some great technology out there and it's really working for us. Rami, we take a look over the next couple of quarters. Obviously, we're in an environment where some businesses are beginning to pull back on spending. Are you seeing that happen at all? And what are you seeing? Are you seeing any orders be canceled yet? You know, we're seeing some customers scrutinize their budgets a little bit more in the timing of their projects. But by and large, I'm delighted with the order momentum and demand dynamics that are existing in the market today. I think we have seen no cancellations, maybe a few push outs. I really do believe that we have a very large market opportunity and we have a very differentiated technology solution about AI-driven operations, AI-driven experience and the ability to grow share even in an environment where we might see some pull back in spending. But so far, we haven't really seen anything. Rami, much ado about the Azure Cloud numbers from yesterday. What are you seeing in the cloud space from your own numbers? So our cloud customers are very important to Juniper networks and our cloud business has been performing very well over the last few years. I honestly don't pay too much attention to the results of any given quarter because generally speaking, cloud providers' business is doing exceptionally well in the long term, they will have to continue to invest in their network infrastructure to keep pace with the insatiable demand from consumers and enterprises for cloud services. And we power many of the cloud networks that are out there, all of the hyperscalers, many of the tier two, tier three cloud providers as well with great technologies for automation, ASIC technologies that drive the passenger requirements for our customers. So I'm delighted with the performance that we're seeing in the cloud space. Speaking of performance, we have a three month chart up right now. But if you take a look at how the stock has fared your to date clearly outpacing so many of your rivals out there, what do you think Juniper has done to really better position yourself than some of the major competitors because you're all 15%",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,83,2022-10-26 19:47:48
4203," He's saying so many of your rivals out there. What do you think? Juniper has done to really better position yourself than some of the major competitors, because you're all 15% but when you compare that to some of the massive losses that we're seeing within the tech sector, it looks pretty good. You know, the future of networking is around AI driven operations. And this is where we have performed exceptionally well. You know, we saw our enterprise business grow double digits both from orders and a revenue standpoint. And the magic, the secret sauce here is our AI capabilities that is crushing the costs of running networks for our customers as well as vastly improving the end user experience of using those networks to do practically anything today. That differentiation is working for us in the market today better than it has in the history of our company. The release sites, a worldwide shortage of semiconductors and other components. You also say we're experiencing ongoing supply chain challenges. Can you talk about those challenges and do you see them improving on the horizon? We grew revenue in Q3, 19% year over year, which means that roughly speaking, we shipped 19% more volume of products this quarter than we did a year ago. So clearly things are improving, but they remain challenging. And in fact, we're sitting on a record backlog for the company, which means that there are a lot of customers out there that are waiting for their products to be shipped. I do anticipate things to start to get better, not completely normal, but better next year. We're obviously working very closely with our strategic suppliers to understand what the dynamics are like. And we've invested in our supply chain to keep pace with or as close as possible with the demand from our customers. That's works for us in Q3. I expect it to continue to work for us through the rest of this year. And I think it should get better next year. I mean, you mentioned earlier that you haven't really seen a slowdown, at least when it comes to some of your customers out there in this weekening economy. But more specifically, what does it mean for your business, for your growth? Because here we are up against a strong dollar. Rates are rising. How are you adjusting? So we are in fact making sure that we're pivoting our investments to areas of the market that are going to be most resilient to any sort of economic downturn. Even if you don't necessarily see anything just now, we are, in fact, looking at investing in new areas in our go-to-market organization and our technologies, that could make us more resilient in the event of that downturn. So for example, public sector, college campuses, health care, our new areas where our technologies are really, really suited for, we just have to pivot our sales motion, our playbooks in that direction. And I think that sets us up for success even in the event of a downturn. Rami Rahima, CEO of Juniper Network. Thanks so much for joining us. All right, coming up next, President Biden cracking down on junk fees from banks and other businesses. We've got the details for you when we come back.

4204," music music music music President Biden cracking down on so-called junk fees. And that means everything from banks and other businesses, Yahoo! Finance is done for Sean Burger. Has it details on that for us? Hey, Jen. Hey, there, Sean. That's right. President Biden announcing this morning that he is indeed going to be cracking down on those so-called junk fees, effectively banning banks from issuing surprise overdraft and deposit fees on bounced checks. His new measure is being announced. Less than two weeks ahead of the midterm elections are aimed at lowering costs for Americans who are grappling with high inflation. Take a listen. Today's actions are going to save consumers more than $1 billion each year. And that's a lot of money back in people's pockets. As director Chopra shared this morning, that his team is even going further developing rules and guidance that would take credit card late fees and other banking fees that cost Americans $24 million a year. Take them on. And we're just getting started. There are tens of billions of dollars in other junk fees across the economy. And I have directed my administration to reduce or eliminate them. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued new guidance on Wednesday, making it illegal for banks to charge overdraft fees. One at the time of purchase, the bank website or ATM balance showed the customer had enough money in their account. The agency says those fees likely violate the CFPB's X ban on unfair fees are unavoidable to consumers. Now, the president says he's just getting started by and also highlighted new rule requirements. The Department of Transportation is working on aimed at requiring airlines and online travel sites to disclose fees for picking a seat, checking a bag or any other extra add-on fees. Guys. Okay, Jim, want to ask you about the SEC also making some news today, passing a rule that would allow companies to claw back executive compensation? What can you tell us? Yeah, so the SEC just approving a rule this morning that would claw back executive compensation of companies that have to materially correct financial statements, basically putting these executives' bonuses in play. The SEC commissioners voted along party lines three, two with Democrats voting in favor of Republicans voting against. Now this is a financial crisis error rule that was left unfinished from that 2008 financial crisis that would require U.S. listed companies to put out a plan to recoup executive compensation if they have to correct those financial statements due to compliance failures. Now, when asked whether he thinks that this new rule could change how companies set executive compensation, SEC chairginslor said, quote, I don't share the view that companies could shift toward more salaries, but while it may change how they're doing it, it better aligns it with incentives that you don't get paid on errors, I think boards would rather have incentive pay based on balance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,85,2022-10-26 19:56:11
4205," May change how they're doing it and better aligns it with incentives that you don't get paid on errors I think boards would rather have incentive pay based on valid financials and take away any possible incentives to have both deep financials. Dave, I have to argue with that logic. Jen Schomburger, thanks so much good stuff. Some breaking news now. Tesla reportedly under criminal investigation in the US over its self-driving claims. Reuters reported the Justice Department launched the probe last year and hasn't been disclosed until now. It comes after more than a dozen crashes involving the autopilot system which was activated during the accidents. Tesla shares edging higher on the day less than 1%. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bill on Wall Street. Stay with us right here on Yahoo Finance Live. Just under a two minutes here until the closing bill, Jay Blacchare, it's a closer look at some of the selling and I guess some of the buying there's some green on that screen that we're seeing today. What's up, Jen? Yes, well, it's some mega caps that are really weighing on the results here and in the Dow. You can see that's positive or at least it was positive energy leading the way along with healthcare materials. But to the downside, XLC, that's communication services and tech. Those sets where the losses are concentrated and you can see that in alpha, that is down 9%. So it was Boeing, by the way, over in the Dow, but Microsoft also down 7% Amazon down 4. Guess what? We got meta after the bell. It's already down over 5% today. It's also in that communication sector that we were talking about. And here's the Dow.

And we are going to leave you with this, the closing numbers on Wall Street Blackberry. Too bad Michelle is not here for us to talk. The Dow closed on the day up just barely eaking out gains 3 points in the S&P up. 0.7% while the Nasdaq Jared talked about. Big names, Alphabet and Microsoft, dragging it down 2% on the day for a closer look at the broader markets. That's brilliant. Jake Jolly, BNY, Mel and Investment Management, Senior Investment Strategist, Keith Fitzgerald, Group Principal. Good to see you both. Keith will give you first crack what's your interpretation of the day? Well, interesting day, I think that investors are grasping at straws, i.e. the mobile eye debut, but at the same time, there's shellacking companies that in this game of things really don't deserve it. So to me it's interesting, we did a little bit of buying, I don't want to look at gift horse in the mouth. Jake, what do you think about today's moves? Keith, I think we're still up over the last couple of days and we're still positive for the month, but I think unfortunately the macro outlook has not materially changed. So we shouldn't be too surprised to see sort of the growth your tech side of the market come under pressure and remain under pressure so long as the interest rate outlook is still leading to the upside. Keith, we've had 24 hours now to let the earnings come in from both Alphabet and Microsoft. And let's start with Microsoft, is there opportunity there given the take down? Well, no question in my mind, you know, this is one of the strongest companies on the planet. It's one of the most widely held companies on the planet. It's up 1400% over the last 20 years. It's up hundreds of percent over the last five. Do you really want to get off a winning horse in the middle of the race? That's what investors need to think. And frankly, if a report like today where they had a double beat top and bottom line bothers them, they really out to rethink why they're investing in the first place. Jake, when you take a look at today's risk off sentiment as some piece still off nearly 20 percent since the start of the year. A lot of this has to do with fears here that we're going to slide into a recession. Where do you stand on that? And do you think the US can still avoid a recession? Well, we do think it is possible to be a void recession. We don't think that's the odds on that. We would give it about a 30 percent probability of avoiding getting some sort of a softish landing gear in the next six to 12 months. But the other side of that probability, 70 percent probability is that we do have a recession or environment. There are still a lot of indicators out there suggesting that there is more pain ahead in 2023. So for us, that means that this is a market that is starting to look much more favorable to bonds than equities. And within equities, we think it makes sense to be defensive and really favor those higher quality names within our equity allocation. Keith, can we avoid a recession? I think we've been in one for the past six months, frankly. I don't think the official statistics reflect that. The average American is hurting, the wallets are hurting, everything's getting pinched in the wrong direction. And I think the fed statistics don't just simply catch up. They're reflecting an economy that no longer exists. Jake, we're one week out now from the next fed decision. I sound like 75 basis one. I guess pretty much a sure thing. What are you expecting? And also, what do you expect then looking out into December? Yeah, 75. Go ahead, Jake. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Big 75 is pretty much in the bag for next week. Well, we're obviously going to be listening for is an indication of whether we're going to get a downshift in the rate of heights coming into December. Right now, looks like the market's kind of debating whether we're going to see it here 75 from December meeting. Now, keep in mind that we get two more inflation reports before the next fed meeting in December. So, we're on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,87,2022-10-26 20:04:47
4207," debating whether we're going to see 50 or 75 from the summer meeting. Now keep in mind that we get two more inflation reports before the next bed meeting in December. So we're obviously going to have a lot more inflation data that's going to influence whether the Fed decides to step down in 50. We obviously saw the Bank of Canada deliver a surprise downshift today. I don't think that's really going to be influencing what the Fed does. But we got to see how these inflation reports come in before we really see how the Fed went to decide to take policy in the summer. Keith, you were chopping up the bit to get in on that. So what's ahead from the Fed? And do you think we'll see in these two months any sign of inflation cooling? You know, let's tackle the last one first. I don't think inflation is going to cool. Not at the retail level. We're certainly all going to get pinched. But when it comes to the Fed, I don't think the Fed understands the narrative. I think it's as wrong now about rates and labor as it has been about transitory from the very beginning. So I'm hoping they're going to pivot. I hope they're going to take a breath. But you know, 75%, 75 basis points is big in twice. So I don't think that's actually going to happen. Traders with real money have a very different viewpoint. So Keith, what is it going to take then in order to see inflation start to cool? That's the question I've been asking myself and anybody else who is going to listen. For a long time, I think we got to fix the supply chain. The Fed simply got to go along for the ride until the government stops spending money because you can't add fuel to the fire and expect different results. And that's what's been happening. Well, divided government will assure that they stop spending money. So Jake, what will help? Well, unfortunately, we need to see some softness in the labor market. But that is facing a very strong, average man. I disagree. Respectfully that we are inter-recessioned right now. I think when we look at the economy, we're still seeing a very robust, economically active economy. And that's the reason that wages are still growing in 6%. And that is a problem for a Fed that is trying to get inflation back down to 2%. They're going to have to keep, keep edit as Jake now has said. Keep typing the screws on this economy. And that's what makes the outlook so challenging in total. I'm very glad to get both of you to weigh in on this because we're taking a little survey over the next hour. You're going to pick a fang stock. We're going to take out Netflix. We're going to put Microsoft in. You're going to pick one stock next three to five years. Keith, you get one. What you got? It's got to be a fang. It's got to be a fang. Only we're taking Netflix out, put Microsoft in. Yeah, let's see. I'm going to use A for Apple. Believe it or not. It's not fang, fang, fang. But you know, I'm going to Apple. That's the one I want to own in five years. Barton. Jake, who you got? I want to buy all of them. But if you're going to force me to pick, I'll take Microsoft. Keith, when you take a look real quick outside of some of those techniques that we've already talked about, we're also using opportunity in the market. Tremendous opportunity, energy that battles a long way from over, both literally and figuratively speaking. Medicine is interesting. That's not going away anytime soon. Those are areas we're keen to look at. And finally, corporate security, literally digital security with the number of bad actors around the world today. That is a must have theme and about as must have as it gets. All right, Keith, this is your out. Jake, Jolly, thanks so much for joining us. All right, coming up, meta earnings coming out right now. We'll break down the numbers for you when we get back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,88,2022-10-26 20:09:17
4208," to All right, some breaking earnings news. You can see Ford shares down 2% after hours. Earnings are in. Yahoo! Finance is pros, supermanian here with the numbers. What do we see in? Amen. Yeah, Ford shares a little weaker here after hours after the report. A revenue, big revenue beat here of 39.4 billion versus 36.9 billion estimated. And adjusted EPS at 30 cents by a penny off from what Wall Street was expecting at 31 cents. But also they're actually taking a 2.7 billion non-cash charge impairment from their Argo state, which tech crunch had just reported that they were dissolving Argo, the self-driving technology company, between itself and Volkswagen. And they're taking a charge, they're saying they're going to invest, they're going to take engineers and invest in their L2 and L3 autonomous technology that we'll hear more about that later. But another big news is they updated their fiscal year, adjusted EBIT to 11.5 billion per year. That range was 11.5 to 12.5, so they took the lower part of that range there. As you know, last month they warned about cost pressures and things like that, warning that a billion dollars would hit and higher cost would hit their bottom line. But we also saw sales here in Q3 up 16% bail, it's about 464,000 trucks. That's a 4% increase in truck sales and 33% increase in SUV sales. We'll dig through this report more to see what's going on with EV and the game plan and things like that. But right now Ford shares off about almost 30% in the after hours. All right, thanks, prize. We want to get to meta earnings there across in the wires right now. Dan Halley has that for us. Hey, Dan. That's right, Sean. We have a beat on revenue, but a miss on earnings per share. They came in at 27.7 billion on revenue expectations, where for 27.4 billion earnings per share of $1.64, expectations were for $1.89. But what we're real issue here is their Q4 guidance. It came in lighter than expected. Meta is saying between 30 billion and 332.5 billion. The street was expecting 32.2 billion. They also said that they're going to be pacing spending on reality lab investments in 2023. But that past 2023, excuse me, but in 2023, the spending will be significantly higher on that. And that's the operation that cost them $10 billion last year as they try to ramp up their metaverse capabilities and move into that kind of company. Reality lab operating losses for this quarter were at 33.67 billion. That's versus expectations of 3.09 billion. Now they did have a little bit lighter than that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,89,2022-10-26 20:13:52
4209," the 3.67 billion, that's versus expectations of 3.09 billion. Now they did have a little bit lighter than expected monthly active users at 2.96 billion versus expectations of 2.97 billion. And we also saw Facebook Daily active users beat that came in at 1.98 billion versus 1.86 billion users. So really not a great look for Facebook here. Obviously, meta, we're looking at shares down more than 6%. And you can imagine what it will be like tomorrow as everyone else digest this news. Exactly. It was off just around 5.5%. Already today we're seeing a drop again, Dave, of just over 6% here after hours. Yeah, let's talk. So he down 62% for the year. There's not a whole lot more room to fall. One would think, Dan, would you characterize these as bad? But maybe not as bad as some expected. But they did beat on revenue, but they did miss on these earnings for share. I think it's, you know, it's the moving forward that people are more spooked by. And, you know, basically saying that they're going to be dumping even more money in next year for reality labs and then pacing this spending. They did say that it seems like they're going to be reducing some headcount. They said they're going to be shrinking some in teams while other teams will be doing it. Some in teams while other teams would remain flat. So they are going to be looking at trimming some expenses. Yeah. But, you know, I mean, this is a company that's been just smashed since really, you know, Apple came out with those privacy changes for iOS. And then since then the slow down the economy and the digital ad market really just kind of crushing them at the same time that they're spending all this money on the reality labs venture, which we don't even know if that's going to be a big deal in the future or not. You did in the headcount. Those couple of lines did stick out to me. Headcount ending. They see headcount ending 2023 next year about in line with what it currently was in the third quarter of 2022. Saying that they're making changes across the board to operate more efficiently. They're going to hold some team, the headcount and some teams flat while they also have plans to shrink some others. Dan took through some of the reality labs numbers there. I think that's a big reason. Why the sock is often after hours in addition to that light guidance that we're getting here from meta. Also just in terms of Facebook monthly active users, daily active users. I want to quickly point that out monthly active users. 2.96 billion that was a slight myth there, daily active users. A bit better, but we certainly are not seeing that growth like we used to. And we know meta has certainly tried to diversify its business from what we initially thought of when we thought of meta. We obviously had the huge focus on Facebook, but that is certainly the switch that we've seen and the way that the company has progressed. Wall Street has not been on board with. All right, well, we are going to take a quick break. And we'll make a back wall of more on meta.

Jeffrey senior analyst here with more on this and Brent. I know you've only had a few minutes here to dig into these numbers, but what's your first take? Look across the board tech continues to miss and they're disappointing. I think what's most disappointing are the expenses. I think everyone wants Zuckerberg to hit the air breaks on expenditures. The fact that they're holding head count flat is good, but I think everyone is calling for more severe measures in terms of trimming head count and trimming the expenses to get a hold of what's happening in this macro storm. So I think as we've said across tech, there's nothing really different here. It's the same story. Microsoft miss, Google miss, Facebook miss, Texas instrument at miss, everyone's missing. The macro is taking a hold and what you need to do in those times is you can't control the top line, but you can control the bottom line. And I think a lot of tech including meta has done a terrible job of getting a hold of the expenditures. It's hard to shift quick, but I think everyone wanted to hear more severe measures on the expense cut and we didn't get that. And so perhaps we get more on the call. But until we get that, this is the same issue at Microsoft and at alphabet. And investors wanted a harder line in the sand on expenditures and we're not hearing that yet. I think we'll get that, but I think ultimately, it's going to have to get a lot worse before these companies actually get in front of it. And unfortunately right now, there's really no support for any tech names. As we've been saying, tactically, until we find the bottom and the fundamentals and we are not near the bottom of the fundamentals, as we've said, it's a dark winter coming. We think there's tactical pain ahead for tech. And I just, again, it's just another reason to steer clear of tech right now for a lot of investors until this clears out. And as you talk, we see that number continue to fall. Brent now 11 and a half percent down after hours. And Brad Gerstner, of course, brought up what you're discussing his company controls two million shares of Facebook wanting a head count reduction of 20%. Do you think would you like to hear that address? Do you expect to hear anything about that address in the call? Well, they had already addressed it. They said flat head count through 23. So we didn't get what Brad wants. It's clearly the right thing to do, right? There's an incredible amount of below it. And we are effectively going into a recession. We've been talking about this repeatedly that it is going to get harder as we go into 23. The fact that companies like Microsoft and Google are all seen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,91,2022-10-26 20:22:21
4211," talking about this repeatedly that it is going to get harder as we go into 23. The fact that companies like Microsoft and Google are all seeing it, it's just an indication of what's to come. And it's going to get worse. And so holding flat, I think, is not good enough, and I think that's why you're seeing the reaction that they don't get it. They're not listening to what investors want. And investors already have enough, had so much pain that they don't want to stick around for this. So it's, again, we've seen the Clint sweep. There's nothing different here between Snap, Microsoft, Google and Meta. And again, you've seen it across semis, you've seen it across most of the rest of software. And if you haven't seen it in software, you're going to see it. They're only delaying the inevitable, in my opinion. So it's really difficult to find anything to get excited about other than valuation. But Facebook's been cheap for a long time. And it's still, it doesn't, these stocks are not finding bottoms until we find a fundamental bottom. And I think that's what's been really hard for investors. It's been hard for me to be honest as an analyst is like, what's baked in? And what's baked in is nothing until the fundamentals bottom. And we are still probably a quarter or two away from fundamentals bottoming. You're Brent, it's very different than this toll. And obviously that Mark Zuckerberg is striking in this earnings release. He was saying that while we do face some near-term challenges on revenue, the fundamentals are still there for a return to stronger revenue growth. It sounds like you strongly disagree with that sentiment. If there could be one thing that Meta needs to focus on, I know you were saying they need to pull back on spending. But the one thing that they can do in the short term to better position the company for maybe the second half of 2023. What can they be doing today? Look, I'm not disagreeing that there's going to be a recovery. But I think everyone, we've said this in tech. Tech is awful at getting in front of the puck. If you guys are hockey players, you know what I'm talking about. Like this is, they just don't understand how to skate and get in front of it. Everyone is late to this. No one is preppy. No one's knowing acting on offense into a macro storm. You don't like wait it out and then all of a sudden you get wet and you're like, I'm going to buy an umbrella. You buy an umbrella first. Right? So of course it's going to get better. But like if you listen to Jeffrey's economist, which Dave Zervelsen and Natan Markowski have been dead on, like things are going to get worse. And the overall macro continues to soften. So again, I don't think this hey, this hope of things getting better. It's not getting better. They missed earnings by 20 miles. So, you know, I understand what tech companies are trying to evangelize for their platforms. But let's just talk about the reality of the environment. When you have a absolute 100% clean sweep of downward pressure across all the top stories with exception of like, okay, let's say 98%. There's 2% that are doing okay still. Like, you got to get more defensive. And these companies aren't acting quick enough. Getting back to the hockey puck though, Brent, don't you think Mark Zuckerberg sees himself as Wayne Gretzky skating to where the puck is going in the metaverse. Although Gerstner wants 5 billion in cuts on spending there. Would dramatic metaverse spending cuts change it all your perception of a company that's trading it what 10 and a half times earnings? Well, there's no question he's skated, but he's like, he's like, seven ranks in front of the puck on the metaverse. Like, we're not ready for it. Okay, no, you know, but when you talk to young young young audience, they're like, I don't want to wear a headset for more than 10 minutes. They don't want to wear for two hours. Like, this is way out there, people. Like, there's way, it's way out. And I think ultimately this goes back to the micro, this, this, this go back to Microsoft. Microsoft is the same thing. You got to go back to the core. The core market that they're in is incredible with their user base globally. The billions of users and what they can do in the advertising market. Go back to the core. Stop spending on things that don't matter right now. You can come back to it, but you don't have to do it right now. And I think this is, you know, El Timner's you know, point and I deeply agree with this view.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,92,2022-10-26 20:26:30
4212," It don't matter right now. You can come back to it, but you don't have to do it right now. And I think this is, you know, El Timner's, you know, point and I deeply agree with this view. Go back to the core, huddle, stand underneath the bus stop while it's hailing out. And when the sun comes back out, you can go plant the metaverse flowers. You can go do all these other things, but don't do it right now when it's pouring rain. Brand, while we have you, I don't make up, look, I don't make up the rules. All I'm saying is this is what our clients are saying. And I agree and he is not following the advice. You know, yeah, and I do agree with a lot of what you're saying here, just in terms of being way too early. People simply aren't on board. They aren't buying these headsets. And we're certainly seeing that reflected in these numbers that we're getting today. Bro, while we do have you though, let's talk about Amazon. That's going to be the big focus after the bell. Tomorrow we have discussed Amazon with you at Great Length in the past. I know a lot of what analysts and what investors are going to be watching as any guidance here in the current holiday quarter. But what are you expecting to hear? Well, if it's any indication of what we've seen already this week, it's more than news. It's already to be so negative, but it's not good right now. And I think look, Amazon has the advantage of already have gone through part of the downturn, right? For the bulk of e-commerce, e-commerce saw it first, right? We're seeing software and these other categories see it later. So the good news is they've gone through part of this. Obviously, the consumer, I think, is going to continue to soften despite what these and other CEOs are saying. I think the consumer is going to continue to soften a little more. And so the e-commerce business is still a concern. I think in EWS, given the weakness at Azure, and the potential, not huge upside for Google Cloud, everyone is super fearful that they are the 800 pound gorilla in cloud at 60% market share of the big three. So if they show weakness in AWS, no one really cares about the e-commerce business. You've got to have the software business, which creates the bulk of the profits continue to do well. Now, they've been putting up 60% backlog growth the last three quarters. The growth isn't going to fall out of the sky. But ultimately, it only took one point of the Azure D cell for Wall Street to freak out and send Microsoft's doc down almost 8% today. So I think what the market's telling you is that any bad news is still not in these stocks. And so we like Amazon long term. I think it's an incredible franchise. I think they're absolutely dominating cloud computing. It's not easy. You cannot catch up to these guys. No one can catch them. They're gone. And so the good news is they're in an incredible position. The bad news is I think what we're seeing is any fundamental issue still investors are just ruthless and they're just selling these stocks down even more given given given this these negative data points. So I think the good news is by the time we get to the print tomorrow, you know, the stock obviously will have already been under tremendous pressure. And I'm assuming Metta is not going to help tech again tomorrow as well, given given what happened with Microsoft and Google last night in the soft tech today. Looks like the case. And finally, that gets us to our survey today. I think you just answered it though. We're getting one fang stock. We're taking Netflix out putting Microsoft in. You get three to five years you're playing one stock. Who is it? One thing for me, it's still Amazon. Okay, we've got we've got an Amazon. We've got an Apple. We've got a Microsoft. So no leader yet. Brent Thill, I was good to see you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. All right. I see how they're doing after hours dropping. Not terrible, but down 1.7, 1.8% at this hour on Q3 earnings. What lies down the road for Ford, David Kudla is the main state capital management founder, CEO and chief investment strategist and possibly remaining in our senior auto's reporter also with us to break down these earnings. It is nice to see you, sir. So what do you make, David, of these earnings? What do we learn that we didn't know from their pre-announcement? Probably the biggest news is Argo shutting down their joint venture with Volkswagen on their level 4 autonomous looking inward. Jim, probably was looking inward at level 2 and level 3 internal development.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,93,2022-10-26 20:30:51
4213," level for autonomous looking inward. Jim probably wants to look inward at level two and level three internal development for their autonomous efforts. That's probably the biggest news relative to the numbers though. Three billion more than estimates on revenue. Thirty cents per share versus twenty seven on estimates. Three cash on the books. This is a good earnings report except for the two point seven billion dollar charge are taking for divesture out of the Argo joint venture. Hey David, Prost here. So we saw that Ford reaffirmed their forward guidance, EBIT guidance for the lower range of the 11.5 billion EBIT there. So that's a good news. But compared to GM earnings yesterday, do you think that Ford is still sort of struggling with their kind of cost structure and how GM was able to sort of perform better here? Yeah, there's been some special factors with from quarter to quarter Ford had built 40,000 vehicles in the third quarter that didn't get shipped. General Motors had a similar problem in the second quarter vehicles that were built to weren't shipped. This chip shortage has just wreaked havoc with the auto makers and gone on for months and months and in other parts shortages. So the same problem that GM had the second quarter that actually increased vehicle deliveries of finished product in the third quarter Ford will get that the fourth quarter. So a special item there. But you know, this is also resulted in a lot of pen up demand even as the economy slows that will help even as the demand fluctuates, consumer demand fluctuates with higher interest rates, with the economy slowing, a lot of pen up demand for for burottos. And Ford shares now down 2% down 40% year to date and down 19% since that pre-announcement of that billion dollar charge and the 45,000 cars parked. How do you characterize their position in the EV field? Not against Tesla who sells 2 out of every 3 EVs, but against primarily GM. You know, I think that, you know, I've got to, I've got to saying, GM and Ford, the domestic auto makers are under loved and under owned. You know, they've, they traded at P.E. right now of 5 to 7. Tesla before the recent slide was trading at a P.E. near 100. And the reason for that is Tesla's seen as a technology company rather than a car company. And Ford are seen as, you know, as as car companies and car companies only even with all the technology development they're doing in the same areas as in many of the same areas as Tesla. I think that they're both poised well right now going forward. They have so many EV models coming out almost everything they make, the F-150 electric vehicle, the CAC, the Lucid electric vehicle coming out, the Hummer electric vehicle that is sold out through 2024. They've just got so many EV models that are coming. They've been managing that transition pretty well. And from a practical standpoint, you know, there's been questions about autonomous. Tesla's pushed autonomous very hard. And I think that GM and Ford are taking a more practical approach to it. And GM Farley showed that today with what with backing out of the level four development that had trouble attracting investors focusing inward on their level two and level three. Good stuff there. David Kudla, Mainstay Capital, Prosubramanian. Good to have you both. Thank you. All right. Coming up, we'll break down some of the stocks moving the most in after hours trading.

4214," This exercises is very important. Many employers across the country have started their open enrollment periods for 2023 health insurance plans, though the IRS has made some changes to health savings accounts and high deductible plans that could affect your choices. Your help navigate what's different this year is Yahoo Finance's Carrie Hennan. Carrie, nice to see you. What do we need to know? Hey, great to be here. Yeah, this is this is a really big time. It's really important to see what your employer is kind of teed up for you this year. But the one benefit that a lot of people overlook if your employer offers it is a health savings account, right? And so this is all about you have to have a high deductible plan, of course. And that means this year, the IRS has set the limits where you have to have a plan. That means what you pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in, right? So what you're looking for this year is it has to be, they limited it to at least $1,000 for a family plan for your deductible and 1500 for individuals. So that they raised those limits. But here's the good news is you can put more into these plans because they're inflation adjusted. So this year, your contribution if you are an individual can be $3,850 or family plan and 7,750 and if you're 55 or older, throwing another $1,000. But Dave, what I love about these plans, at most people don't get, it's like a tax trifecta. You can you don't pay tax in the money going in. You don't pay taxes on the money as it grows because you invest this money. You don't take, you don't pay tax on it, federal taxes when you take it out. And if it's used for medical expenses at the IRS as approved, they have a whole list of these. And most states don't tax you either on capital gains or the amount you take out to state student in Jersey and California. But this is really one of the few investments that you can roll over year to year. And it's kind of disguises a health benefit. But I'm telling you, it's also a retirement benefit. You roll it over. You can take it with you when you retire or if you change jobs and retirees, the cool thing is,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,95,2022-10-26 20:39:43
4215," benefit, but I'm telling you it's also a retirement benefit. You roll it over, you can take it with you when you retire or if you change jobs. And for retirees, the cool thing is you can, there's no required minimum distribution like other plans. You can let it hang out there and keep growing and keep investing it. And so that when you do take it out, you can use it for those medical expenses in retirement, not covered by Medicare. And that's really, you know, that's a bananza for many people. Welcome news for people beaten down by inflation, Carrie. They're not for everyone. Who are these accounts not good for? Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I get real excited about them because I think it's a really terrific opportunity. But if you are somebody who has a lot of health expenses, if you have a chronic illness or if you expect a major kind of life event in the next year, maybe a pregnancy or something that may a surgery of some kind for the neck for 2023, you might not benefit as much because yeah, as I told you before, these are high deductible plans. So you have to pay a bit out of pocket before your insurance is going to kick in. So it might not be the best deal at least for 2023 if you have some of those upcoming things. Carrie Hannah, nice to see you. Great information for our audience. Appreciate that. All right, let's get a shot of see what's moving after hours. All right, Dave. We have a bunch of earnings. Once again, this afternoon, Meta Ford service now and aligned technologies. Let's kick it off with Meta. You can see the stock off nearly 12% here after hours of company reporting and earnings miss also softer revenue guidance. It's earnings revenue from its reality labs also missing expectations because people simply aren't buying headsets. We just heard that from analyst Brent Thil taking a look at the performance here over the last three months. You can see the stock off just around 18% over the past year off 58% here we are today right around 52 a week lows. Mark Zuckerberg also making some headlines about head count plans when it comes to Meta. He's saying that he sees the head count at the end of next year, the end of 2023 around the same level as what we just saw at the end of the third quarter of 2022. So certainly raining in any hiring plans that the company had had and you can see Meta off just around 12% after hours. Let's take a look at Ford here. It shares off just around 1.6% when you take a look at the quarter numbers. It wasn't that bad revenue beat at 39.4 billion but adjusted EPS coming in a bit light. Ford also saying that it recorded a $2.7 billion charge on its Argos stake over the last three months. You can see the stock actually barely in the green up just around 2% year to date. Totally different story. You can see shares off around 38%. Let's take a look at service now. That stock jumping after hours up nearly 12% EPS coming in better than expected at 196 this share adjusted revenue at 1.93 billion CEO Bill McDermott. He has been named to the chairman post. He's going to be succeeding founder Fred Lutty. He look at some of their guidance. So miss just by a bit. Fourth quarter and full year subscription revenue coming in just a bit light looks like the street though shrugging that off. You can see shares up just over 11.5%. And the line of technology. Rounding it out there shares a sinking 18%. This is the maker of invisaligned. He can look at some of these numbers earnings coming in a bit light 136. The S. Man was for 217. Remnew 890 million S. Man was for 973 million. A couple of things from the CEO in this earnings release. He talked about the weaker macro economic environment also weaker consumer confidence that having a direct impact on his business also Dave mentioning the strong dollar something that we've heard from a number of these CEOs that have reported over the last couple of weeks. Certainly have one of the stores the year. Thank you. All right. Apple Amazon. A.B. Inbeve all on tap tomorrow. My stock to watch driven by my stomach again. MCD McDonald's reporting Q3 earnings on Thursday. Expectations are for revenue of 5.7 billion earnings per share of 257. We're really watching for the impact of inflation of what Shana mentioned foreign exchange headwinds and any success about its limited time offering such as its collaboration with streetwear brand.

4216," Here today, if you hadn't heard, the Macribe is back on Monday on Halloween for what's being built as the legendary sandwiches, farewell tour. That's right. Goodbye, Macribe. Speaking of food, celebrated chef and restaurant tour Wolfgang Pock here in a talk inflation, restaurant worker wages, and really the state of the restaurant industry coming out of the pandemic. Don't go away. Food is getting more expensive and that means you'll probably pay more when you go out to eat the next time. The latest data showing that the cost of dining at a restaurant is up 8.5% from just a year ago. It is 15. A week later, it went up to $2,000. I mean, some of this thing has gotten out of control. And forget about if there's something to repair in the restaurant, just to get somebody out to come and fix your stove or your refrigerator, it costs a fortune. So everything has gotten up, but also salaries. You know, we are one industry. We employ more people than any other one except the government. You know, over 17 million people who are in the restaurant business. And now it's really a pie-as-market in a way. You know, the employee said, I want that much money. And I will work that many hours and that many days. So it has gotten more...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,97,2022-10-26 20:48:24
4217," A Pius market in a way, you know, the employee said, I want that much money and I will work that many hours and that many days so it has gotten more difficult for us but you know we have to navigate all these problems and go through them. I do want to circle back to the employment shortage but as for those 15% higher cost are you seeing a reduced appetite for paying that? Are you able to pass along those costs? You know it looks like the luxury segment is still there, you know people still have money to spend, maybe they go out one less maybe but not that much really. I know in Las Vegas we have restaurants in Las Vegas, it's booming, it's better than ever and I'm sure the hotel is the gaming is doing better than ever because we are, we get the customers if they lose enough money they have to eat and drink. So and I think here in New York, cut in New York is doing really well too especially for dinner. You know for lunch we have less people maybe because less people go to the office and so forth but then our people still go out and want to enjoy and you know have a nice time. How does remote work, I'm sorry, how does remote work impact your bottom line? Well I think the remote work at the beginning was really difficult because we did a lot of takeout but not that much really and to me it's a boring business really doing takeout because you put everything in boxes instead of on a nice plate. You don't get the reaction from the customers you know it's like performers like to perform on Broadway or singers in stadium whatever they get the energy from the customers and for me it's the same. So I really like to be there in the restaurant. Now for sure lunchtime because people don't work that much in the office has dropped so but we live our main business always has been dinner thank God. When you take it you mentioned the labor shortage they're affecting your business obviously severe amounts of a shortage and workers not only in your industry but really across the board. First is how has it affected your plans, your initial plans for expansion and really your ability to keep open the restaurants that you already have? You know it is really difficult but it's a worldwide phenomenon. You know if we have Spago in Put Up Es for example it's hard to find workers there I said well in that part of the world they must have enough people coming to work but no. It's as difficult in Put Up Es as it is in New York or in LA to recruit people and I think thank God we have a good name and we pay well so we still can get people but it has gotten more expensive. I know our sommelier for example in a restaurant used to make a $100,000 plus decommission and they came up to me and said somebody offered me a job for $130,000 can you match it? I said you know what I will match it because I like you and you are good to the customers but also for me to train somebody new would cost me more than $30,000. 130 grand I might be in the wrong business that is impressive. I'll put the little wine rack over here that can test you how much you know. I knew you were a genius. You might be better on the tequila friend. Either way I don't discriminate. I like that both. Indeed. We have some fun food trends to ask you about. You're huge on TikTok. Another thing that's huge on TikTok is food and recipes and cooking and the latest trend is butter boards. More than 300 million views do you know what these things on the screen are right here? Wolf have you tried a butter board? Do you like the trend of TikTok cooking in general? You know I love TikTok in a way because I think it gives you the news instantly. You see what's going on but it was interesting like for me I did a TikTok and I had won the cheese for example. I just cut a pumice in chunks, put olive oil and black pepper on top and I got like 6 million people who watched it and another thing I did like was the sillier thing is I had a big block of butter, a nice forget and I used the butter and the baguette and put salt on it and people say oh my god that's so delicious. I bought something like that. Maybe I shouldn't have steaks anymore. It can be very simple now. This isn't necessarily a TikTok trend but certainly a trend in the food industry.

4218," food industry, the rise of popularity of pumpkin spice. I don't know if you've ever tried it. Have you tried it? People spend what? $500 million in total. It's spent on pumpkin spice flavored items in the US each year. What's your reaction? I think pumpkin spice in a way makes you feel good. You know, when you smell it, it reminds you of holidays. It reminds you of Thanksgiving or for me Christmas. I remember I was a kid at home. My mother used to pick cookies and all these spices. Really, I loved. We even put them in wine. You know, hot red wine with sugar and the pumpkin spice and it smells up the whole house and it's really delicious. So I can understand that everybody likes this warm feeling. Wolfgang, great to have you in studio. And I mean, you need very, very hungry. I'm counting down the minutes hours. Look still. I'm at cut over a bottle of red and a steak. OK, you know what? We just got some new steaks in. They are amazing. You know, so I'm really happy. You don't have to sell us. We're already there. OK, right. OK, thank you so much for joining us here in studio. Thank you. Come on, next Taylor Swift's midnight's album, just did something no other album has accomplished in five years. I'll tell you what it is next. Let's go. OK. Taylor Swift's new album Midnight is having a massive opening week. The new album has a huge impact on the music industry at large. Midnight's moving 1.2 million units in the US during its first three days of release. That's according to Lumany. That number should be even higher by the end of this week, historically speaking. This is the first album in five years to move more than a million units in its opening week. The last one also being from Taylor Swift with 2017's reputation. But besides just streaming, Taylor has really emphasized that she wants to sell physical copies, more traditional forms of media, vinyl, CDs. That's important because those traditional copies weigh more heavily when we talk about billboard charts. So it's a really important strategy for her.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIy-Q36neE,99,2022-10-26 20:56:59
4219," in all CDs. And that's because those traditional way more heavily when we strategy for her and the just keeps happening. So I Well, at least being a music over to movies. There's Yes, and I'm a Halloween to the nitty gritty of the nitty gritty of the horror because the post pandemic has really benefited from horror. I spoke with box office pro chief analyst Sean Robbins. He told me that the box office has been incredibly resilient. If you take a look at the top 13 horror films I had debuted since the pandemic movies like a quiet place to more recently smile they've really outperformed representing 10% of movie going attendance during opening the audience usually skews younger that's been a big factor. We saw younger audiences were the first to return to theaters for those movies specifically 53% of the audience has been under the age of 35 and these movies they're inexpensive to make their low risk.

4222," Bring in. Y'all finances Alexi Schienen who has all of the latest on all of the trauma forest. Alexis, where do we stand with this deal getting done by Friday? Well, definitely inching closer if you look at the confidence that investors are expressing here with the stock price that spread for a Twitter stock narrowing within about a dollar of that $54.20 offer from Musk. Certainly he's getting the whole kitchen sink by spending $44 billion. But he's just tweeted in the last minutes and I want to tell you what he's talking about. He tweeted directly to Twitter's advertisers. And what he's telling them is that most of what's been said about what he thinks about advertising on Twitter is wrong. He says the reason he's acquiring the company is not to make more money, but because it's important to the future of civilization. He says it's important to have a digital town square where a range of beliefs can be debated. He says still he understands that Twitter can't become, I quote, free for all hellscape where people can say anything. He says the current danger of social media is that it will splinter into extreme polar echo chambers. He also blames traditional media for fueling that divide. But if we look at what the Wall Street Journal's reporting, they say that the banks have already started to supply the equity financing for Musk. The rather the debt financing for Musk, that's about $13 billion. They say that there's some details that still could be worked out, but they've already started to send that money over to make it available for Musk. As for the equity side, Musk is putting up about 23.5 billion of his own funds coupled with about $7 billion from venture capital firms coming from about 19 firms for a total of $33 billion there to make that total purchase possible. Of course, if all of that doesn't come to fruition and the parties don't sign on the dotted line by 5 p.m. Eastern media, and that's not the case that Musk had planned to lay off 75% of Twitter's workforce. Bloomberg now saying that no, that's not the case that Musk in fact told employees yesterday that that was not his plan. He's also planned to speak with employees tomorrow. The day that the deal is said to be closing and done. Yeah, although report is not the case that Musk had planned to lay off 75% of Twitter's workforce. Bloomberg now saying that no, that's not the case that Musk in fact told him. Yeah, although reportedly he's going to get rid of 75% of them, right, of those employees. That's something that's been talked about. It's interesting that in this same note to advertisers that he mentioned Alexis, he said he, this goal that he's pursuing is with humility, which if it was, that might be the only thing. He recognizes he says that failure in pursuing this goal is a very real possibility. And it's interesting that he's addressing the failure on a day where meta is plunging more than 20% in part, yes, because of expenses and spend on its metaverse efforts. But also because its advertising rates are down. And so there's a lot riding on his ability to get advertisers and quality advertisers to come to Twitter here. Yeah, absolutely. And you know, Julie, as I was reading this tweet from Musk this morning, I was thinking back on the tweets that we were able to see between Musk and some of his finances and some of his business associates that came out in the trial. And absolutely, there was a bounty of tweets from Musk, received from Musk about how exactly to monetize Twitter. So that absolutely is a focus here while he says he is not doing it to make money. He understands that it must make money to survive. But look, there were all kinds of permutations as to how the company could actually become a reliably profitable company within those exchanges. Alexis, Kenan covering this one from start to finish. We'll talk to you soon, Alexis. Not yet. Not yet. Support your entire store-stab day here. The Federal Reserve may be on inflation fighting campaign, but it's not doing much to common nerves of executives on the topic of higher prices. About two-thirds of companies in the S&P 500 that reported earnings in the first two weeks of the reporting season had execs mentioned inflation on the earnings call. The data is compliments of facts. Medicare shares were still in free fall after another underwhelming quarter and outlook while his reported earnings to $20,000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,1,2022-10-27 13:46:23

MetaShares are now in freefall after another underwhelming quarter. MetaShares are now in freefall after another underwhelming quarter. I'm going to follow his channel today on Facebook, Instagram, Instagram or iTunes. I can say that this situation is very broadcast, connecting these issues with our country to return it. We're still having a by rating on this stock. last night. What did you think of how they're approaching all these issues? Patients, patients and more patients. That's what Zuckerberg wants from the street and whether they have it, we don't know yet. Does he deserve that patience? Yeah. If you look back, over the last seven, eight years, probably giving him some credit we're building some of the largest platforms in the world. So looking ahead next three to five years, probably there is a, I would err on the side of giving him a little bit of benefit of doubt, but right now they are in a big whirlpool of a negative sentiment. Nobody believes their ability to innovate, fight against Apple, fight against macro, fight against TikTok. So the headwinds are outnumbering. Outnumbering the Zuckerberg right now versus what?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,2,2022-10-27 13:51:02
4224," fight against Apple, fight against macro, fight against TikTok. So the headwinds are outnumbering, outnumbering the Zuckerberg right now versus what his dream, his vision is. And I think there is also a messaging problem here. I think they are making progress versus appellant TikTok and they are getting hit on on macro as well as metaverse. So there are certain forward progress moves, but I think that's just getting masked by how they are messaging on the next year's spend plans. Rohit, by rating what suggests things get better in the next 12 to 18 months. What gets better for this company in the middle of next year? Over the next three to six months, I think one of the drivers would be macro in my opinion. As in they already talked about September and October felt better than what it would have been. They are lapping Apple effects. So there are two aspects of the headwinds that I think Facebook should start to feel better about. One is how they're tackling Apple headwinds and how some of the macro headwinds are ebbing. Beyond that, their AI investments should start with how their engagement is trending and perhaps TikTok headwind starts to ebb and flow at that point. So we are talking about over the next six months. That's the way I feel if I'm right, that's how the stock would unfold. But again, they need to prove that they can be disciplined with costs and that I'm afraid may not happen for another six months at least. What part of the metaverse does meta-platforms actually have to get right, see some type of user kind of acceleration and adoption of what they're putting on the market versus what Roblox metaverse has already looked like for so many consumers. Again, I think metaverse that bucket of investment is going exactly in the opposite direction as compared to what we thought it would at this time last year. I think they're doubling down on the hardware software combo suite. It is almost 10 years ago, an Apple or Android trying to create their own phones, create their own app store, trying to market the app store and trying to get engagement. All of that in one fell swoop for a new device that nobody is currently using. So I think it's a significantly larger vision than what we thought and that is going to take more investments. And I think near term, all they need to show is greater adoption of their form factor. Whether that form factor improves over the next 12 months, we don't know, but just overall better adoption of form factor and that's not coming in here. So the sentiment is going to be negative in my opinion. So the only thing they can do is show disciplined costs and reducing spend. If they just tell the world that okay, we are going to be disciplined and not have more than two billion of losses per quarter in metaphors, I think the stock goes up. I just don't know when that's happening, right? They didn't show any indication doing that. To come back to the to the metaverse numbers for a minute, Horizon World, according to the Wall Street Journal, has only 200,000 monthly active users. 500,000 was the target the company originally set. When do you think they might get to 500,000? It's been slow going. It has not been going in the direction that they have been. We are hearing more of not just direct to consumer, but direct to businesses, be to be play in the way they feel, the VR headsets and VR capabilities may evolve over the next 12 months. So they gave around some 10 bits yesterday around how enterprises may be using this. So it's still very early days. We want to see that a company with more than $100 billion in revenues per year. For that to start to show some impact, it's probably going to take a few billion dollars in revenues and probably we have at least a couple of years away for their virtual reality, a segment to start to get to say $5 billion in annual revenue run rate. Just to start to show some moving the needle, it's going to take a lot longer than that. That's where we say patients, patients, patients and whether investors have that so far, they don't think they have that. Well, investors will not exhibit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,3,2022-10-27 13:54:43
4225," that's where we say patients, patients, patients and whether investors have that so far, they don't think they have that. Well, investors are not exhibiting a lot of patients today. We'll see what happens going forward. M.K.M. Partners, or heat coal colony, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Coming up, shares, I mean, Donald's up about 3% after same store sales surged in the third quarter, so it's going to share his happy meal take on the best food company last. So. M.K.M. Share some McDonald's are in the green after the company beat earnings estimates and in Germany. Tasty US same store sales increase of 6% and most importantly, it wasn't just McDonald's pushing through higher prices on lower income consumers They also saw higher traffic and that is very important considering we just heard from Chipotle See a full heart Jack heart on yesterday Traffic to its restaurants were down and a lot of other restaurants Fest food locations are seeing down traffic so McDonald's traffic up. That is a good thing next US Amstor sales above consensus increase of 4% always like to see that I'm not a fan of the 4% drop in overall Operating income of course that speaks to an ongoing inflation papers packaging wages and McDonald's getting hit by that And then lastly here China sales were down also red flag to me could be a re through what Starbucks might show in a couple weeks or so Went it reports its earnings of course Starbucks a major player in that China market next on a couple of things You know as you look at this corridor you think about what my",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,4,2022-10-27 13:59:21
4226," I'd show in a couple of weeks or so when it reports its earnings of course Starbucks a major player in that China market. Next on a couple of things, as you look at this court and you think about what you want to see or you would like to see from McDonald's in 2023, a couple of questions here. Do people trade down from a Chipotle to McDonald's in a recession? Some of the price points as we talked about over at Chipotle getting a little pricey. Next FX headwinds or foreign exchange headwinds are likely to stay at least until the middle of next year for a global multinational company like McDonald's. That means revenue will be held back. Next can retro toys and gimmicks really be a long term sales driver from McDonald's? What was not in this quarter and I was pointed out to me by our food beet reporter, Berk DiPoma, that this is not this court did not include the bump in sales from that cactus plant adult hoppy meal toy and also the Halloween buckets that they came out with as well. Some analysts on the street have McDonald's sales in the US tracking up close to 20% because of these promotions. They're very popular. And last but not least watch out Burger King. They're going through a revival. I think you'll see a lot more interesting products from them and promotions next year from CEO Jose Silas, something to watch out for and see if they can take market share from McDonald's. And a cool chart here coming from David Palmer, Everett Car, ISI, how McDonald's has historically done in past recessions. And you can see they have a by and large McDonald's has proven somewhat recession proof. Obviously you see fluctuations in sales but still McDonald's doing pretty well during periods of slow growth or flat out declines and economic activity. Last but not least, him with that McRib is back as we talked about that is coming on Halloween. There I am. In the face with a McRib and as we knew when I talked about this Brad, the McRib is not really pork. It's different parts of animals mesh together and really it is shoulder, striped and two or three other ones that are supposed to or make it work. But it's not a rib. It's not a rib. You want the real rib. You got to go to Arby's. Arby's is offering a rib. And I think they have some hard. It's going to be real. It's going to be real. All right. That is the take on the Golden Arches, Mickey D's and Pink Donald's, Arcos Dorados, whatever you want to call them. Call them up here on the day actually. All right. Taking a look at what's coming up next. We're going to speak with the CEO Raymond James on the back of that area before them. The other side is short break. states. the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,5,2022-10-27 14:04:11
4227," Welcome back to Y'all Finance. I'm Brian Sousy alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Lots coming at investors today. Pretty lame outlook for meta, but a good quarter from Caterpillar JDP. GDP came in pretty good at about 2.6%. Right now you're seeing the Dow sold in the green, the S&P 500 NASDAQ in the red, of course, weighed down by that meta report. But let's get over to Julie Hyman, some breaking news and all things mortgage rates. Yeah mortgage rates were learning last week, averaging 7.08%. So breaking the 7% barrier here, this is according to Freddie Mac. Again, 30 year fixed rate mortgage above 7% for the first time going back to April 2002. So it has been more than 20 years since we have seen a mortgage rate at these levels. We have seen already the ripple effect through the housing market. Yesterday new home sales were reportedly down 10.9% month over month, although that was actually not as big a drop as estimated, but it is having an effect on pricing across the nation, on affordability across the nation and on the pace of home sales. So again, 7.08% is where that 30 year fixed rate mortgage on average now stands. Brad. 33 minutes into today's trading session. Let's take a look at the major averages to see where things have started to move around just a little bit. The Dow Jones Industrial average still up by about 300 points right now. 1% higher. We're off of today's session highs, but still holding on to the green. The NASDAQ composite, we've seen some way on tech right now, and we'll get into that in a hot second when we go over to the heat map, but as of right now, the NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that down by a little more than 1.1%, 125 points, triple digit decline day for the NASDAQ thus far. The S&P 500, that also being dragged a little bit by tech right now, you're seeing that down by about 2 tenths of a percent. And so going over to some of the heat maps very quickly here, taking a look first at the sectors that we're seeing. And yeah, you mentioned it, well, I mentioned it actually. It's down by about 6 cents of a percent. It's technology here going super meta here on myself. And since I mentioned meta, let's go over to the NASDAQ and take a look at those major cap, mega cap tech stocks as well. And you're seeing some of the declines across the board Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and then yeah, additionally meta. Look at this down, 22%. We're touching levels we haven't seen since February 2016. Also, everyone, strengthen the banking sector here. It's continuing with Raymond James reporting a beat in revenue and estimates banks and finance have recently seen a boost from higher interest rates, but Raymond James is also taking careful note of what it calls a challenging and volatile market environment joining us now to talk about earnings and the sector. We've got Paul Riley, Raymond James CEO in a first on Yahoo interview. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, as we were breaking down some of the earnings that have just come across and largely the season that we've been navigating through, if there's kind of a common denominator or a set of them that you've been taking away from this, what are they from your perspective? Well, first, great to be here and it's always good to be on the show. There's just a lot of uncertainty and I think this is the great thing in our business is people neither financial advisor, more than ever. You have uncertain equity markets. All you have to do is listen to four or five speakers with different views. So it's not certain where we're going. The Fed clearly has said they're going to continue to raise interest rates and inflation numbers high. The GDP number was actually good today, but again, that shows the economy is going. So it's, you know, it's, you know, you have to pick stocks. You have to pick your choices because it's a very uncertain market and frankly, in the last almost decade, as long as you were in, you did pretty well. And that's not the case today. So investors are, you know, their individuals are in different situations. Some are still longer term and they can take the downs with the ups. Some can't afford the risk. And now fixed income is giving them a chance to invest in and most people are in between. How do I balance the long term bets and equities against inflation versus making sure I have income? And, you know, so it's, it's complicated environment, but it's a chance to really, you know, show your value also. Paul, it's good to see. Thanks for being here. If people are coming to see because they're concerned about the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,6,2022-10-27 14:07:50
4228," But it's a chance to really show your value also. Paul, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. If people are coming to you because they're concerned about the environment and they want advice as they seem to be, what is happening in terms of their willingness to pay for it? I did see asset management fees were down 6 percent collectively, but I wonder what's happening on an individualized basis. Have you been, I mean, we've been talking everybody about raising prices. Are you all raising your fees? Well, you look at the, with us, the advisor really has the primary client relationship and the fee pricing is really set with them with our oversight, but to the what they're doing for their client. And what we've seen is most advisors aggressively managing fees in terms of what funds they go in, what and how they're managing, what the cost is to the investor, but to the incline, but surprisingly, I mean, those fees with the advisor have held up extremely well. And I just shows the value. The value isn't just investing. It's psychology. You know, so many people wanted to get out of the market pre-COVID. They would have lost a huge opportunity where they can look at the down in the last few months and say, well, look at my down. And they can remind, look, this is your, you're on plan. This is your plan for your life. You were up, you know, more than you thought. You're down a little bit now, but you're still on plan. Stay invested so you don't get hurt. And that value, in almost a family psychologist, in many cases, has shown that people are still willing to pay the fees and the fee to the advisor themselves is been under surprisingly a lot less pressure than the overall cost for us to produce, you know, more effectively. Paul, a lot of your peers in the industry are now looking at a lot of belt tightening as the industry has slowed. What are you doing inside of Raymond James? Well, we're, we're trying to be very thoughtful. So first, we have comp pressure as the whole industry has seen. We start talking about it a year ago and, you know, before people did it and we're going to treat our people well, both with our record results this year and quarter, but also because that's the, you know, the market today. And we have to make sure we keep people. We can only belt tighten so much. We're still growing. We're growing across all of our businesses and, you know, so we're still recruiting and hiring people. So the focus is where do you spend smartly and where do you stay focused? Like for example, our tech spend is going up. Our technology for which we believe is leading edge industry leading for our advisors on in terms of wealth planning. You know, we can't let that slip because that's what's driven our, you know, continued top of the industry recruiting and retention. And now the apps to the individual, you know, clients, again, we got again, that's there because that's part of the market. So in other areas in the back office, we pride ourselves in top level service. And we have to push to be more cost efficient and what technologies and processes can we use to keep those costs in check. So we're still in growth mode. We're cautious on the economy. The great thing about the company well before I got here. It's always been long term focused. We've been criticized maybe over the last few years of having too much capital and liquidity. We aren't right now. And you know, so in bull markets, maybe we look like we're, you know, being too conservative. But we plan for these kind of markets and that's it's showing up in our growth and we still have plenty of balance sheet flexibility to operate even if we do have a hard landing. When you think about the absence of easy money policies and what that means for some of the more speculative assets that even the wealthiest clients that you may deal with would be prone to perhaps nibble at in the past. Where have you seen that strategy start to wane and perhaps shift into some of the other spaces and what types of recommendations are you are you providing them? Well, you'll still see that as kind of, you know, cyclical. So certainly when rates move quickly like they have. So if you go to the bond market, certainly the non-rated bonds and things get hit first and get hit hardest. But at some point at that price adjustment, that's when, you know, the very wealthy or hedge funds or investment funds see the opportunity in the best. So it's really calling when that happens. So you have to look through the whole cycle and look at the opportunities for the culture, education,uminin, and money to demonstrate around the socialist system of thinking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,7,2022-10-27 14:12:19
4229," investment fund see the opportunity invests. So it's really calling when that happens. So you have to look through the whole cycle and look at the opportunities for those clients. Now a lot of clients don't have that extra network. So you got to keep them down the middle, but others that do have that ability. You know, it's kind of a weight and sea and strike when they see the opportunity. Now if you believe there's going to be a hard landing, that means there's going to be a lot more opportunity and you keep powder dry. If you think this is going to be a softer one and you're going to get a pickup, then you know, you can be a little more aggressive now. We see clients on all sides of that right now. So it's again, not an easy call to say, where are we going to be six months from now? But from a company standpoint, you know, with our flexible balance sheet, we didn't lock in rates with a lot of our competitors did. And we're seeing the benefit of that now. And we didn't, we just don't try to focus on maximizing short term earnings. We're seeing over a cycle, what's the right thing to do? And so even if it gets into tough times, I like where we're positioned right now. We always appreciate your soothing tone, Paul, especially in these crazy times. Always going to get some time with your Raymond James, see Paul Riley. We'll talk to you soon. Very good to see you. Okay, before we head off to a short break, let's highlight the exporting goods. We are seeing the stock being defended by Evercore ISI analyst Warren Chang. Chang acknowledges that investors are right to be worried about bloated inventory from Nike Adidas and Under Armour. And how that will impact margins at exporting goods, but Chang, in his team, things the concerns have become too overblown. Chang maintained an outperform rating and $160 price target on shares of the exporting goods. Coming up, we'll speak with the CFL forward on the back of that company's third quarter earnings report. We'll drive back. Here's a little bit of some of the other headlines that we are watching right now. First up, Samsung's third quarter profit misdannel assessments. Samsung's third-generation air leave Jay Young as its executive chairman. This comes as the company looks for, quote, stronger account. The company also appointed third-generation air leave Jay Young as its executive chairman. This comes as the company looks for, quote, stronger account.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,8,2022-10-27 14:16:39
4230," And for smartphones and wearables in the fourth quarter, the committee also appointed third generation, Eric Lee, Jay Young, as its executive chairman. This comes as the committee looks for, quote, stronger accountability and business stability in light of the current uncertain global business environment. And Shell's getting a boost today following the announcement of a new share buyback program resulting in an additional $4 billion of distributions expected to be completed by its fourth quarter 2022 results announcement. In addition, the British multinational oil and gas company plans to increase the dividend for share for the fourth quarter by 15 percent. This all coming as show reported an earnings peak in its latest quarter. And you deliver a raise in sales forecast for the year after hiking prices by a record 12.5 percent in the third quarter. The increase in price and lead to the company's sales growth accelerated to 10.6 percent in the third quarter and consumer goods giant now expecting underlying sales growth for the full year 2022 to be above 8 percent. However, you'll see more negative underlying volume growth than in the first nine months as shoppers are starting to come back on essential spending. Sauce? We continue to track shares of Ford as the company tightens its profit outlook for the year and pull the plug on autonomous driving platform Argo AI. Ford CFO John Lollard joins us now alongside Yowl, Finance Senior, Auto Correspondent, Product Supermanion, John. Good to see you again here. Let's start with Argo AI getting a lot of attention here in the early going. Why did you pull out of this and what does that mean for your autonomous driving efforts? So when we looked at the business opportunity here, we saw that the ARK-2 is scaled profitable business was a long way off. Five years plus out. And so what we've decided is that we're going to reallocate our capital. We're going to focus on L2 plus and L3 driver assistance technologies where we can give our consumers time back in their vehicle in the near term and give them a better experience and we think that that's going to be a much more profitable scaled business in the near term. So it's really about allocating our capital to where we see strengths, where we see the opportunities and adjusting our businesses. We see fit. Hey John, process here. If you want to follow up on that Argo discussion here, is it just that we can't have enough clarity as to what it would take timing wise, money wise to get to level four or level five? Well, I think from a technology standpoint, I'm not a technologist, but I think we have some of the best technologists in the world working at Ford Motor Company. And they believe that to technology, there's a lot of hurdles that it needs to cross through before. It's able to provide a scaled and profitable business. And that's what's key, a scaled and profitable business. And that's why it's not just the technology. It's the business model that has to be built out. It's the number of vehicles to scale that across the country. It's the depots that are going to have to manage those vehicles. It's very expensive. It's going to take a significant amount of capital to build that out. It's going to take quite a bit of time in our opinion. And therefore, then we pivoted. We decided to allocate the capital to L2 plus and L3 driving technologies, as I said, which we think has a much more immediate opportunity for us as a business. When do you think we'll get to full self-driving John at this point? It's Julie here. I mean, does that happen 10 years from now, 20 years from now? Never? Well, in the industry, it moved really quickly at first. And then it's that last 5 or 10 percent that's been difficult to solve. And it seems that we thought we were close in the next year for the last 5 years. And it's taking time for that to develop. And when you listen to certain technologies, they'll tell you that the problem is extremely difficult to solve. It's one of the most difficult problems facing us today from a technology standpoint. So our view is it's at least 5 years out. And with that, we pivoted. You've seen some higher supply costs right now. And for those suppliers that you're working with, you know, how successful are the negotiations just to keep the supplies that you need to work through this backlog of vehicles that are perhaps lacking parts, just to keep the costs the same. So that is a constant that you can expect going forward even into next year. So we have seen inflation, inflation costs hit our business. And we saw that move.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,9,2022-10-27 14:20:48
4231," that is a constant that you can expect going forward even into next year. So we have seen inflation cost hit our business. We saw that in the third quarter as we guided a billion, four to a billion, seven adjusted evit. We came in slightly above that inflation and supply cost were a big part of that number on a quarter over quarter basis being lower. So we're continuing to see that labor's tight, supply chains, ocean freight, domestic freight, all very expensive right now. So we're seeing it across the board. So the important thing for us is to work with our supplier partners, look to drive efficiencies. We own a lot of the opportunities that we can work with with our supplier partners. They're being very proactive and collaborative with us. And I think it's the same for everybody right now. Inflation is hitting all of us. We have to work collaboratively. We have to find productivity. We have to work on the cost productions, eliminate waste. And we have plans to do that. And we're implementing those plans. So I think it's a similar play for most companies out there today given the inflationary environment we're in. John, I was sad to see you in news this week. It went viral the fiesta. It's gone. My friends had that back in high school. Are there other models in your lineup that you can cut to save some costs? Well, I think when you look at what we're doing there in Europe with the fiesta, it is a product that's been around for a long time and it's beloved in Europe is that we're moving towards our electrification plan. And this has been part of our plan for a while. And that's just another step in that direction. And you'll start to see more electrified products come out in Europe over the next year. And it's a transition plan. And I think we're going to see more of that as we move to an electrified lineup as we move forward. We're going to have production capability for electrified vehicles of 600,000 units next year on the way to 2 million units by 2026. So we'll see more of this as we transition and we move to new main plates and we move to new battery electric vehicles. So it's just part of the transition, the industry seeing as we move forward. Hey, John, speaking of the industry, are you guys seeing any demand or sort of us a slowdown coming from the economy or rising rates? So we are starting to see some signs that the inflation and the higher prices are impacting the consumer. What we're seeing is a narrowing of what consumers are willing to pay or a discount versus the suggested retail prices is a bit higher. We're also seeing that consumers are looking for longer-term loans, 84 months and beyond, given that payments are higher. They're trying to keep that payment into a range that they think is affordable. And we're also starting to see the mix shift on some of our iconic vehicles like the F-150. We were seeing the turn rate on our highest series like a Lariat, turn faster than a mid-series like an XLT, and we're starting to see that shift where the XLT is turning quicker than the Lariat. So they're starting to see the early signs. We're watching them closely. We're going to keep abreast of that. But given the total macroeconomic environment, the inflation and what the consumer has been facing, we're starting to see that come through in some of the signs for us as a business. And what about globally macroeconomically? If you think of China this most recent quarter there, you have to look through some of the different competitors in that space, I imagine, and look across some of the consumer demand to really understand and look into the data about where they're opting for some of the homegrown brands. As we've been seeing that show up in some of the other automakers industry, if you will, players, reports that have come out thus far. Well, when you look at China, it is a really dynamic market, and it is transitioning to beves much quicker than any place else in the world. And there are some very good local Chinese Bev manufacturers, and they're having an impact on the industry. And when you look at our China business, Lincoln's doing very well. Our ICE business or internal combustion engine businesses is profitable. It's really the transition into battery electric vehicles in China that we're working on in a very tough and competitive market. Some of the local Chinese players are the real deal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,10,2022-10-27 14:25:05
4232," Electric vehicles in China that we're working on and a very tough and competitive market. Some of the local Chinese players are, they're the real deal and they're from medical competitors and you're seeing that show up in the marketplace. All right, we'll leave it there. Fort CFO, John Lawler, always good to see you and good to see you as well. Y'all find his prize at Supermanium. Talk to you guys soon. Okay, the executive power hour on Y'all Finance Rages On. We'll chat next with ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott. ServiceNow seeing a lot of interest on Y'all who finance following a better than expected quarter and rather upbeat earnings call. The software company announced CEO Bill McDermott will also assume the role of Chairman Bill McDermott joins us. Now Bill, always great to get some time to see Y'all on our ServiceNow ticker page and our platform stocks of 15% my question to you. Where's the recession? Oh Brian, thank you very much. You know, the waters out there are choppy and that's why the world seems to need the now platform and has demonstrated that in their decision making. Look, we have a platform that's truly a once in a generation deflationary force. We're seeing tremendous adoption for not only all things IT and digital transformation, but companies aren't hiring as much in some case they're firing and you got to do more with less so this idea of workflow automation to give employees a great experience. On the customer service side, you know, it's one thing to engage a customer to sell them something. It's another thing in the mid at the back office and the supply chain to optimize the whole experience. And that's where ServiceNow comes in. And I've been saying all along the digital transformation tailwinds were much stronger than the macro headwinds, but you do have to adopt to the environment and I'm blessed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,11,2022-10-27 14:29:49
4233," And I've been saying all along the digital transformation tailwinds were much stronger than the macro headwinds, but you do have to adopt to the environment. And I'm blessed to work with 20,350 women and men that did just that. Turnkey ready to run solutions for a better world. Bill, I just got, I want you to expand on this a little bit because it is just such a different message than we are hearing from some of the other companies within technology. And even within enterprise software, right, that they are seeing that choppiness, but it seems to be more of a problem. So I mean, is it there, there's something more unique about the company or about the niche that you guys are filling right now? That's a great question, Julie. This is a very unique platform. You know, there was the operating systems, there was the database era, there was the application software era, we're now in the platform era. And what companies are trying to do is they're trying to drive productivity, they're trying to automate their supply chains, they're trying to rethink their procurement processes. They have to really do more with less. And the reason that choosing this platform is it is one holistic platform that was engineered for deflation, it was engineered for efficiency, and it was engineered to give fast return on invested capital. So you're seeing a platform that's being adopted by one large manufacturer as an example that's taking a billion out of their procurement costs on the now platform. And we have them up and running in less than 100 days. This is a major corporation. So this has never been seen in enterprise software and our brand is now becoming best known for that platform, the now platform, the digital transformation engine or the center of gravity of digital transformation in today's modern enterprise. It is all about the technology, the people in our company are incredible culture and are ever expanding ecosystem. It's really fascinating to see how quickly we were able to adjust to a tough environment with the best technology and the best team. You've got other companies within the tech landscape that want to take the applications that people use, companies are using, employees are using on a day in day out basis and put it in a virtual reality, put it in the metaverse. The metaverse is really going to be real for so many of these applications or is that just a pipe dream perhaps that we're seeing some of the market move towards? I think there's a real place in the world for the metaverse and it is real. But even if you do spend time in the metaverse, you always have to come back down to earth where the real people live and actually execute your business plan. And I think that's where we come in. We have no issue with enabling somebody's dream, for example, to set up an e-mol and become the retailer of the future in the metaverse, creating digital experiences with somebody that they would have never participated before. Let's say a fashion show where somebody can actually simulate in the metaverse that they're in Milan watching the fashion. That's great. And then what's even greater is if they see something that they want to buy, they can actually buy it and then we can optimize it in a real supply chain in a real manufacturing process so we can actually make a real sale. So you're always going to see this interdependency between a metaverse world and the real world where business takes place. And that's where we come in. We play both places. Bill, for what it's worth, I'm bullish on the real world. But maybe that's just me. Talk to me a bit about your job retraining effort. You talked a little bit about it on the earnings call and the earnings press release, but it sounds like a big initiative for you guys. It's really exciting, Brian. We announced rise up with ServiceNow. And we're going to train a million people by 2024. Some of those people will work for ServiceNow. Many of those people will work for partners of ServiceNow and many of those people work for customers of ServiceNow. We realized that this is a once in a generation platform and this is a once in a generation opportunity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,12,2022-10-27 14:33:40
4234," And many of those people work for customers of service now. We realize that this is a once in a generation platform, and this is a once in a generation opportunity to grow super fast and make a real difference in the world economy. You know, there's an 11 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 on the scale deficit in the world. We believe it's the opportunity deficit. So by 2028, we're going to help the world close that 11 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1. By bringing service now and literally millions of people in the ecosystem to service now. So we can transform the businesses of our customers into public in the private sector all over the world. Super exciting time. Bill, I'm sorry, I lied to you last time. We had you on and said, we'd talk basketball because the NBA season did just start back up. So next time we will have to talk a little basketball CEO of Service Now and chairman Bill McDermott. Thanks so much for the time, Bill. Thank you very much, Brian. See you soon. Definitely. All right, guys, coming up. Big tech, taking a hit this early season. But what should investors expect from Apple? That's the big question. We're going to discuss that. Next, Brian, Brad, and Julie. AUDIENCE Welcome back everyone. As earnings season continues to roll on crushing the tech industry one major company yet to report is Apple. So let's take a deeper dive into what we may see after the bell today when the tech giant releases its fiscal fourth quarter numbers. Bloomberg projecting revenue of more than $88 billion and earnings for sure to come in at $1.26 here. Of course this is still a business that relies so much on that demand for the iPhone. We've kind of heard from some of the telecoms players that if people are spending continuously with them they're spending higher into higher price plans and that could potentially mean good news for Apple as well if you read through that. But we'll see exactly where those numbers come in at given the iPhone 14 the pricing strategy and for some of those other products as well wearables and services is what I'm going to be watching. Strange setup here I would say for Apple on the one hand. Excuse me the obviously don't have that advertising business as a snap Facebook and a Google that hammered those results. No and they're the source of the troubles. Right. Especially what's not here exactly right but then we saw a PC weakness by a lot of you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,13,2022-10-27 14:39:14
4235," Facebook and a Google that hammered those results. No, and they're the source of the troubles. Right, that's where exactly it is. Especially what's not, you're exactly right. But then we saw a PC weakness by a lot of you who've been seeing increasingly a PC weakness from a lot of companies right now. So how is that playing out in Apple? I will say this, by and large, the streets expecting or position for Apple to beat not just a little bit on earnings, but potentially be big, owing to a stromer growth profit margin and lower operating expenses and momentum on the iPhone 14. So anything that smells of a disappointment, you could be very easily see a sell off an Apple. So a couple thoughts on Apple here. There after we had met it yesterday, there was this sort of narrative emerging that Apple was going to be the savior of the earnings season, right coming out because Apple has been such a solid and consistent performer. So there's a lot riding on Apple and it's not just about the company stock, it's sort of about salvaging tech earnings, exceptions like service now, notwithstanding. A lot of the large tech earnings have indeed been lousy. A couple of other things to mention here, obviously as we showed the various components, revenue sources for the company, and the iPhone is still the behemoth here. The number two area now is indeed services as the company has been pushing for now for several years. So the estimate there of 19.97 billion dollars. So that's going to be closely watched as well. We've talked a lot recently about Apple music. We talked a lot about it in the office. Apple versus Spotify now that Spotify may be raising its prices and we're going to talk about Spotify in a second. So that's something to watch as well. The third thing that I've been watching is the stock performance. It is down more than 16% year to date. If it does finish the year with that kind of a decline, and obviously we have some time left, it'll be the worst year since 2008 for Apple with that sort of 16, 17% decline. In fact, if it declines more than 7% or so, it'll be the worst year since 2008, which again, illustrates just how consistent a performer it has been. If you go back to 2008, there were only two other years that were down years since then for Apple shares. So a lot. So you know, and this is type of environment. I like time. No, it's very good to have a steady hand Tim Cook, former CEO of the company, understands operations as pretty much seeing every cycle over Apple. Apple may report disappointing quarter, but still just having him at the helm still, I think it's very important. I think what he also understood that has clearly driven the culture at Apple now too, as much as we talk about your phone connection and your device being a necessity, he's also understood that there are little luxuries that you can layer on top of that necessity, and that is services. And that's what's gonna build them out to being a $80 billion run rate business within services alone this year. Says the Apple Music Guy. All right, so let's get to that other music streaming service. We're talking about Spotify following the third quarter earnings miss. The shares are still down about 1.3% today. Our Alexander Canal taking a deeper dive into what's next for Spotify. So, Ali, what are we looking at here? So to really understand what's going on with Spotify, you have to go back to the beginning, right? When the company first IPOed via direct listing in April 2018, at that time, there was a lot of excitement about this company, the potential, the growth prospects, but there was this overhang when it came to the business model. Can this be a profitable business? Now more than four years later, we're still trying to answer that same question and investors and analysts, they're sort of getting tired of this growth at all cost strategy that Spotify seems to be implementing. So I spoke with CFRA analyst John Freeman and he told me that Spotify is a company that's not oriented towards profitability. And that at the end of the day, their margin disappointment is not short term pain like CEO Daniel Eck has been stressing, but rather it's structural and that's a problem. He suggested that potentially, Spotify needs to explore new management that there could be elements to this business, that Eck just doesn't understand. And by the way, as of December 31st, 2021, Eck owns 16% of Spotify's outstanding shares, maintained 31.9% of voting power. So he has a lot of say in this business. And if you take a look at their operating expenses, that growth was 65% year over year. And it's from things that Spotify can really control, right? Personnel, they're hiring at a time and a lot of tech companies are pulling back. They're acquiring companies. And it's this sort of sacrificing profitability for the sake of subscribers, no matter what the cost is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,14,2022-10-27 14:42:32
4236," A lot of tech companies are pulling back. They're acquiring companies. And it's this sort of sacrificing profitability for the sake of subscribers, no matter what the cost is. And that's not really going to fly on Wall Street too much longer. If the short term is just so challenged because of their own spending, what does the long term mean for this business? Yeah, and long term analysts on Wall Street, they're pretty optimistic that Spotify will be able to eventually hit those 30 to 35% margins. But I'm talking long term, like 2027 and beyond. There's a lot of optimism around potential price increases, JP Morgan estimated that if Spotify does raise its premium plan to $10.99, that could add incremental revenue of 200 million euro, which is significant. But again, we're back to this narrative of potential, potential, potential, and not really any tangible action. And I want to read this quote from Daniel Eck on the earnings call. He said, top line growth in the platform is a leading indicator for future success on all other financial metrics. And that's a pretty bold statement, right? Just focus on our revenue. Don't worry about our earnings. That sort of goes to show where his focus is right now for the company. And with this macroeconomic environment, if you weren't making money in 2019 when things were much better, how do you expect to make money moving forward? So there needs to be a lot of changes. You need to pull back on spending. So a lot of questions for this company moving forward. Yeah, potential might work when you're in an easy money environment. Less so. Yeah. Thanks so much, Ali. Appreciate it. Coming up, shares of Overstock are trading lower after facing some revenue stepbacks. We'll speak to the company's CEO next.ா né.

4237," Shareers of Oversock.com down nearly 10% this morning after the online retailer posted third quarter earnings beat on an adjusted basis, but a 33% drop in revenue amid a quote, challenging retail environment. Joining us now to discuss the results of company CEO Jonathan Johnson. Jonathan, good morning. It is good to see you. We are obviously seeing a challenged environment, not just in retail, but more specifically in home goods as well, which is your bread and butter. So talk to us about what you're seeing right now. Well, it's a very highly promotional time. From the second quarter to today, there's been excess inventory in the market. We and others are having special promotions. It's a tough time. The good news for Oversock is, even during this tough time, we're turning a profit. This is our 10th consecutive quarter of turning a profit, which in our space is notable. And we think we're doing it because we're providing a smart value to our customers. Our customers like what they can get for the dollars they're willing to spend. We provide that value to them. Jonathan, I was thinking to look at some of the census data, especially around housing right now and the market's slowing at this point in time, during by range of factors, but none more pronounced than the fact that rates are rising. It's more expensive to get a home. There's less supply that's coming online. What does that mean in terms of trickle through to Oversock? Well, definitely home sales when they're robust help us. Today, what we're seeing is the categories on our site that are doing well are things that relate to home improvement. We've seen an uptick, which I noted on our call today in bathroom vanities. We've seen an uptick in mattresses. So people realize they may not be moving, but they want to make their homes where they live today better, more comfortable. So it's a different type of purchase than we've seen in the past. And they're also very deal conscious. They're shopping a lot. They're looking for the best deal out there. We think that's where Oversock excels. We're always providing smart value and trying to make dream homes come true for our customers. Jonathan, there's a lot of, like you mentioned earlier, there's a lot of inventory in the retail channel right now, Walmart target, you name it. And a lot of those retailers are playing to get very aggressive on promotions this holiday season. How aggressive are you prepared to get? Well, it's not just a question of planning to get aggressive. Everyone is being aggressive. You've seen an increase we held an Oversock days event earlier this month. Prime, there's been a second prime day this year. People are already shopping for Christmas. I think the Cyber Five Black Friday through Cyber Monday are going to be as promotional as ever. The good news for Oversock is we've got lots of products, giftables, small appliance, things that are people, things that people look for in this fourth quarter as they shop for their home. But it will be a highly promotional fourth quarter. Jonathan, one last thing for you and it's about the sort of branding of the company. You guys recently rolled out a new ad campaign, emphasizing people's homes and it's called making dream homes come true. And you saved the release and this was last week that this new campaign should dispel any lingering misconception that Oversock sells liquidated or excess merchandise. Any plans to change the name of the company which implies right? Oversock sort of implies that it's Oversock. It's liquidated or excess merchandise. You know, that's a great question. The good news for us is Oversock's name recognition is extremely high. The not so good news is what you've said and that's trying to associate our name more with home. Changing the name is an expensive proposition right now with our new national campaign which includes, you know, a new ad that's out entitled, Come on, Get comfy, brand ambassadors that we've announced that are helping our social media presence. We think we can associate the Oversock name with home. After all, no one goes to create.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,16,2022-10-27 14:51:02
4238," helping our social media presence. We think we can associate the overstock name with home. After all, no one goes to Crayton Barrel to purchase crates or barrels to purchase things for the home. We think we can do the same for overstock. All right, comfy stock. I don't know if it has the same ring to it, but we'll see what the measurement the metrics look like after the campaign overstocks CEO Jonathan Johnson. I always put your speak with you. Thank you. Thanks. Guys coming up, we're gonna break down some more earnings. We've got a line technology's automation and then we're getting the drink and high-resolution. That's one of the other side. MUSIC.... It's time for Cut for Time, everyone. Three stories, one minute each. Let's start with this on the day in Visaline Maker. Align technology is seeing its shares. Get a little chewed up this morning. It's lower by about 17.5% after missing estimates for its third quarter. It cited lower volumes, FX pressures, and higher promotions. Analysts are cautious when week margins here and sending the shares lower here this morning. This stock is down 72% year to date. So this is not the first time that we have seen declines like this afford this company. It's been struggling for a little while here and the whole value proposition, et cetera, is getting braces in a different model. I think there's questions about this. This was one of the pandemic plays. Everybody wanted straighter, brighter teeth because they were on these zoom calls. But now it appears to be on winding in Joe Hogan. We've talked him a bunch of times. And Reese, you're saying that sales have come under pressure because of continued macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence at the end of the day to get a great smile. It's going to cost you some money. Did you guys have braces? I did. Oh, yeah. Big time. Yeah. The automation missed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,17,2022-10-27 14:55:48
4239," confidence at the end of the day to get a great smile. It's going to cost you some money. Did you guys have braces? I did. Oh, yeah. Big time. Yeah. Jack me off your life. All right. Auto Nation missed EPS estimates, but feet narrowly on the top line. It shares our office. seal. Mike Manley says inventory in the industry remains constrained and retail sales of new and used vehicles is still below historical levels. Definitely a different tone here compared to what we heard from Carm Actors a couple weeks ago. They reported earnings not a good quarter. Stockwood absolutely slammed, but Auto Nation out of the gate here. Pretty good quarter for them. It is pretty good quarter and at a time where we know that some of at least for some of the used car retailers that have been out there just trying to get or hold on to inventory number one and then what prices consumers were actually going to buy that inventory at. So it's actually a question of when they're going to be able to on the financing front have some more favorable terms that consumers are actually saying all right, you know what? This is beneficiary for me and for Auto Nation actually maintaining some of their own revenue expectation. It also seems to be where which cars people are buying, right? So apparently Auto Nation got its profits from premium luxury vehicles, which was up by 14% parts in service profits. Also up 9.6%. So maybe that's the differentiator here. And Budweiser maker AB imbev shares. We are watching those as well. They're up 7% after the company reported mixed results beating EPS estimates, but missing narrowly on the top line. The CEO says consumer demand is still strong for its drinks and that beer is a resilient category. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. We're going to talk to Michelle Dukeris that's the CEO of Budweiser tomorrow in studio. I look forward to seeing it, but I'm very focused on some of these categories besides beer that are doing well. Budweiser zero that is doing seems to be doing pretty well and this beyond beer segment led by things like cut water and neutral vodka seltzer seem to be doing pretty well. A product called brutal fruit. I'm interested in it. Brutal fruit. Yeah, that's a great name. All right. What is worse than brutal fruit? Liquid death or I mean you just saw something in the table. It's the first thing you said cut water. Cut water. Oh yeah, well no, that's pretty good actually. Isn't that the that's the mixed beverage right? It's probably fizzy. Yeah, something like that. But they also on the pricing front had actually succeeded in pushing through some higher prices persuading consumers to shift to the higher price premium brands and all major markets except China. premium cars premium beverages. Now we got a premium market check for you. Let's take a quick look at where we leave me. It's done by us. All right. The Dow the S.I.P.O. trading higher right now. The Dow alleding gains. Caterpillars in there. It's up one and a half percent. The NASDAQ is lagging. Metas in there. It's off by a half of one percent.

4241," Oh, I mean, no, not especially right now. I think that the timing of this is very difficult for them because we are in a tighter monetary policy era. I know that meta has big pockets, but still investors don't want to see this kind of investment in something so far out in the future when there's so much uncertainty right now. I mean, Facebook was a game changer when it came to social media. Will metaverse, the meta be a game changer for the metaverse going forward? That's yet to be determined. And Mark Zuckerberg is really asking investors to believe in him in this strategy, but it's far out. Well, and the other thing to watch here is the regulatory environment. When you think about how Facebook and now Meta became the company it is, and we're able to grow their platform. A lot of it was through acquisition. You look at something like Instagram. You look at WhatsApp. Well, now they're an environment where they're certainly nopping embrace from regulators. They're not able to go out and acquire companies. And I guess the question is, if they could, is there a play they would make here within the metaverse? But that's going to continue to weigh on them too, because essentially they have to innovate their way out of all of this. And I'm not sure that the track record necessarily speaks for itself when you come to what they're doing internally versus how they've been able to grow through acquisition over the years. Yeah, and metaverse really something that I mean, this should be more of a startup. This is what you're talking about is, when you're talking about acquisitions, so which other companies would they acquire in this field anyways as well? I mean, this is- So Nason, very early. So early on. I do want to point out that when you took a look at the market cap of meta right now, I mean, this is what also is scaring investors. We have seen a slow-instead decline. And right now in the S&P 500, it is number 21 as far as market cap is concerned. It's behind Exxon Mobile, it's behind Chevron, Proctor and Gamble, Master Card Home Depot. So it's falling quite a bit. Okay, let's keep the conversation going around meta. We've got Laura Martin, Needham, Senior Media and Internet Analyst. Laura, you know, we- And as an I were talking about what we heard on the call yesterday, we didn't even touch on the digital ads part of it. Real certainly one that Facebook meta has made a big bet on. They said they haven't been able to monetize it in a big way, but that was interesting in your notes. You said there was a deafening silence of this historical ad business that has been the big revenue driver over the years. Yeah, I thought the most interesting takeaway was the silence. And I thought the best question on the big call that everybody could hear was, you know, everything you're talking about is new. This all sounds very experimental. Why isn't it experimental to you and what about the old business? And I think, you know, and I think Mark's answer was, like, either he's not focused on the old business or he doesn't think there's a future in the old business, but nothing they spoke about yesterday actually is the business that today is worth 300 billion market cap and used to be, we're 700 billion market cap. It's almost like he's walked away from the core business that is making all, historically has made all the money. And I thought that was the most interesting thing from the call. And Laura, I mean, when you're talking about walking away from the core business, I mean, should he be focusing on Facebook? Is this what investors want? They don't want this sort of experimental into the future. And especially during a time like this, do you think timing has something to do with this? I mean, I thought your point was fair that the market right now wants current cash flow. It wants to bring lower risks. So it wants cash on cash returns. I'm just, I think the way I read his choices is he's worried there isn't a core business unless he can stymie TikTok. Like that he's worried TikTok is going to take away all of his content creators and his audience. And like my space, when you may recall Facebook, took all of my spaces value away. It sounds to me like he's worried TikTok is gonna take all of his value away unless Reel's works, which is his knockoff of TikTok. So it just feels to me like this is a business at Facebook where every 10 years, Snap comes along and he has to copy it or die. TikTok comes along and he has to copy it or die. What are these?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,20,2022-10-27 15:08:26
4242," feels to me like this is a business at Facebook where every 10 years snap comes along and has to copy it or die. TikTok comes along and has to copy it or die. One of these days you won't be successful copying the hot new thing and I just wonder if there's actually a business here that is defendable. Yeah, I mean, Laura, to that point, you know, we were talking about the tough environment that is already dealing with in terms of regulation. We know what the track record is with these acquisitions, whether it isn't acquisition or taking an idea from another company. When you look at where they want to go with the metaverse, I mean, how convinced are you that the innovation internally is there to make this even if it's long term, a viable business? Look, I think Facebook has realized or meta now is realized that it doesn't control its destiny. It doesn't own its content because content creators are leaving it right now to go create content on TikTok and taking their fandoms with them. And it doesn't own its distribution platform because it's sitting on Apple and Apple is capricious and arbitrary about changing its rules. And Apple doesn't really care about its rules hurt meta. So I think meta's answer to that is to let's create a new computing platform like ARVR glasses where we are the platform background. We charge everyone else 30% and we change art rules capricious and arbitrarily and hurt apps on our platform. I think that's their play there. I think this really stepped up when Apple started making privacy changes in the fourth quarter of 2021. So I think he's realized like a lot of apps have that so long as Apple or Android control the policies on their platform and they are answering to regulatory fears on their end, that at no app is safe, no app controls its destiny. So his play with a metaverse is to actually own the hardware that is the platform that consumers use. So he can charge 30% and change rules. So you know what that said Laura what do you value this company at? Is it about the future play? Is it a metaverse play or is it still a social media company that just hasn't been able to compete in an increasingly crowded environment? I would say the latter that I think it's hard to value because it's unclear there is a core business here if they can't successfully replicate TikTok with reels. So I think the core business value is a big question mark especially maybe outside the US is okay, but in the US it really is worrisome. And then the metaverse you have to put about in order to value this company, you must decide is the metaverse going to work? Are we going to write off 10 to 20 billion dollars a year in his spending until he figures out it's not going to work? So I think that's the issue with valuing this company now. It's hard to value the core business in a network of fixed business. It's going the wrong way and it's hard to value what the metaverse will be worth because at the earliest he's saying it's going to be worth something in 2030, which feels like a long way off for investors. So I think investors are doing the right thing today by using their liquidity and exiting the shares until it is clear what the value of either the core businesses or the value of those metaverse investments are both of which are really hard to value today. Yes, certainly a steep fall from yesterday when you look at where the stock is down right now. Laura, always good to get your insight. Laura Martin, Neatom, internet analyst there. Well, it's clearly been a rough week for Big Tech. His economic headwinds make it make its mark on corporate results, but the week is not over yet. We've got two big ones on tap today. Apple and Amazon next in line to report their results. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Ali Garfinkle, who is looking ahead to the big numbers coming out after the bell today, Ali. You're right, Akiko. It's been a rough week, but it's not over till it's over. We have two huge names here. Right. First, we have Apple. What are analysts going to be looking for? And the big thing for Apple today, I think is going to be iPhone sales, Akiko. I, if you recall, a couple of a little while back, we got those reports about weakening iPhone demand and the company pulling back production. The Apple stock went into a bit of a tail spin and his sense recovered. However, that is going to be the thing that investors are looking at, spotlighting. Can the company in this consumer slowdown show that iPhone sales are resilient? So that's Apple. That's a huge, that's going to be a huge one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,21,2022-10-27 15:12:45
4243," Spotlighting. Can the company in this consumer slowdown show that iPhone sales are resilient? That's Apple. That's a huge, that's going to be a huge one. And on the other hand, we also have Amazon reporting after the bell. And for Amazon, it's actually going to be, in some cases, a similar story. They analysts are looking for AWS growth. They're looking for retail sales. The company is coming off to prime, prime events in recent months. And there is hope that those prime events are really going to boost some of those numbers. But it remains to be seen, right? This has been an incredibly difficult week for not only for meta, for Microsoft, for alphabet, across the board, those headwinds, whether it's Forex, inflation, a hawkish fed, consumer slowdown, you name it, it has hit just about everybody. That said, there is some optimism from what I've gathered from sources. You know, JP Morgan is saying that Amazon is its best idea in tech right now. And Web Bush's Dan Ives does believe that we could see some wins out of Apple today. So we'll keep, we'll keep you posted after the bell. But there is still some hope before this weekend's okay. Certainly investors looking to end things on a positive note, at least with these tech earnings. Ali, thanks so much for that. Well, strong quarters helping live shares of caterpillar. We are seeing a big pop there up more than 8%. This is a company we often turn to as a bell weather for the broader economy. It earned $3.95 a share on revenue of $15 billion dollars. That marked a 21% jump in the same period last year. The Texas-based equipment maker, facing rising material and higher freight costs. But greater equipment sales on higher prices helped offset some of those inflationary pressures. The firm saying that it expects price heights in the fourth quarter more than offset higher costs in manufacturing. Well, coming up, temporary relief. The U.S. economy post-positive growth for the first time this year. But much of it down to the one-off impact of a narrowing trade deficit. So the recession is still coming, right? That's what a lot of people are asking today. We'll try to answer that question for you on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,22,2022-10-27 15:17:17
4244," dib And the post-pandemic recovery in demand have led to a broadening of price pressures and an increase in inflation. That was ECB President Christine Lagarde, setting the table for why the central bank doubled its key interest rate. The remarks at the press conference following its decision to hike by 75 basis points. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickery who is on top of all the big moves coming on the back of this. That's right. First thing I want to point out is that the euro is net down after the move. Let me just show you the intraday price action since midnight. And you can see we got some fireworks here, but right around parity with the US dollar. As you said, a Kiko, Christine Lagarde and company doubling the short term interest right there to 150 basis points. But the outlook for the future, not quite as hawkish as the Federal Reserve. At least that's what traders are saying right here. Now, let me put a three-year chart and you can see clearly the euro is still in a very firm downtrend as I pointed out just a second ago. It is at parity with the US dollar. Now, overnight, we are going to get an interest rate decision from the bank of Japan. And let me show you what's been happening over the last three years with the US dollar versus the Japanese yen. And the US dollar is strengthened appreciably. Here is a year-to-date view. And then over the last seven days, this is going to show that supposed Yintervention that happened last Friday when Kiko, you and I were calling this in real time as there was something underfoot in the market. And you can see the dollar net down since then. That is a market departure since the last time there was an intervention by the BOJ over there. You can see not really having much effect two weeks later that high was taken out by the US dollar. We have to see what comes tomorrow. Karuta, as we have saying, he is the BOJ head there. He is out next April and he has doubled down on his strategy. Standing by yield curve control, we will have to see if the market forces his hand overnight. We will be watching. Thanks so much, Jared Blyckery. Let's take a closer look at some key stocks and sectors. Our next guest is seeing value in web browsers, Coke bottles and fracking suppliers here with more is Frank. Brian Frank, CIO Frank funds and Frank Valley Fund portfolio manager. Brian, thanks so much for joining us. You are basically saying that tech as you see it is cyclical. So what? Tech out, value in. Yeah, absolutely. We feel like this is the golden period for value investing. It looks like it could be a lost decade for index funds because they are heavily weighted towards tech. And tech is very cyclical. People don't tend to realize that when they get excited about all the growth that happens in tech but as we have seen with MADA and the other earnings reports coming out, it is pretty cyclical. What do you make of this divergence that we are seeing? You mentioned during the break that it is interesting to see how even with disappointing earnings coming from these mega tech names, that is not necessarily dragging down the rest of the market. That is a bit different than what we have seen in the previous quarters. Oh, absolutely. And I think it is kind of a sign of healthy market function. The market actually cares about fundamentals again. The last few years it was just about what is the Fed going to do to make everybody rich and drop money from the sky. And now it is about, oh, is your company actually profitable or are you actually growing? And that is a sign of good market function. However, there seems to be things under the surface that are showing a lot of weakness. So it is something to be concerned about. Well, you said it kind of reminds you of $99,000, right? It does remind me of $99,000, which was that golden period of value investing. All the value investors look kind of stupid in the late 90s not buying those tech stocks, but then boy was there a reversal. And value stocks actually went up in that period when the Nasdaq melted down about 80% from its highs. So where should investors be now? Because you are looking at some interesting names here. You are looking at Opera. Tell us a little bit. So Opera is a tech company, but it is a lot less cyclical we think because it is just a web browser. It is the largest independent web browser. And the way a web browser makes money is when you actually type in to do a search. So it is a growing business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,23,2022-10-27 15:21:31
4245," think because it's just a web browser. It's the largest independent web browser. And the way a web browser makes money is when you actually type in to do a search. So it's a growing business. They used to only focus outside the US. Now they're focusing more in developed markets. And they're having some great success. But what most attracts us to that company is they're doing something that the big guys can't. Because the valuation is so low, they bought back 20% of the company in a very short period of time. So they have the cash to do it. They have a low valuation to do it. And big tech just can't compete with that. Another name you say you like Coca-Cola? You say this one's recession resistant. Sure. Yeah. You cut out the crews. You cut out the big vacation, the big spending. But you don't necessarily cut out the day-to-day treats like Coca-Cola. We like a company called Coca-Cola Femsa, which is a distributor in Latin America. And their largest bases are Mexico and Brazil, which have actually had a stronger currency this year against the dollar. And we just saw from Jared about the meltdown of the Japanese yen and the euro. But Brazil and Mexico are actually getting stronger against the US dollar. Those economies look to be doing OK. And they're growing a lot of volume coming out of COVID with their Coke. And Coca-Cola, I should say. Going off the US dollar, I mean, tell us what you think. How should investors be positioned given the strong US dollar? And should they be in multinationals that are offering services and abroad and getting a lot of their revenue from abroad? Where do you see things? So in the Frank Value Fund, which is the value fund that I run, we focus on companies that have control over their prices. So in a multinational, if you have a great brand, you can raise your prices when you're facing inflation like that. For other people who are more dependent on other companies or maybe a commodity or something, you don't have that pricing power. And it's been a bloodbath this year, I think, across the board, even though we're actually up in the fund. Kind of finding some good values. However, you have to be very careful. And I think those multinationals will be able to raise their prices if they have a good brand. With that said, though, we have seen a bit of a softening in the dollar when you compare it to where things have been. In part, someone would argue because the expectation with the feds that they'll at least move a little slower, if not a pause in terms of the rate hikes. When you look at what goes into the fund, I mean, how do you factor that in? What is your outlook in terms of how significant those effects had ones will continue to be? We hope that they slow down. But when it comes down to it, even if the fed pauses, they're still the most aggressive central bank in the world. And it's going to keep the dollar strong. So that's good for companies that are buying goods that come from abroad. But if you're exporting, it's going to be a tougher market. Try exporting to Japan. The purchasing power has declined so much out there. So I know people get excited about a fed pause. But you got to ask, why are they pausing? They were talking about being so aggressive. And now they're pausing. Maybe there's something wrong with the economy. So that could be a whole nother leg down for stocks. You have to watch out for. Yeah, you had another trigger for those recession fears. Brian Frank, CIO, Frank funds, and Frank Value Fund portfolio manager. Appreciate your time today. Thank you very much. Well, coming up, reverse gear, Ford and Volkswagen will shut the fully autonomous driving unit they backed. But others are still doubling down on the technology. So our self-driving cars, the future, or not, we'll discuss next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,24,2022-10-27 15:26:20
4246," and We saw that the Ark 2 is scaled profitable business was a long way off. We've decided that we're going to re-allocate our capital, focus on L2 plus and L3 driver assistance technologies, where we can give our consumers time back in their vehicle in the near term and give them a better experience, and we think that that's going to be a much more profitable scaled business in the near term. That was Ford's CFO John Loller speaking to our morning team earlier today. The group recorded an $827 million net loss in the third quarter. That was partly due to cost related to its autonomous vehicle unit. It's joining Volkswagen and taking a sharp turn away from fully autonomous driving, and they are shutting down the Argo AI unit they both backed. But what about that argument that self-driving cars are the future? The future, prosubermanian here to tackle that question. We always knew it was going to be a tough hurdle, but it does feel like companies are sort of saying it's now or never, is it worth the investment? Yeah, it's like this challenge of our time with the phrasing it as. And, you know, like level 2, level 3 where the car can do some things on its own, but you're still there with the string wheel. That's doable. They're working on four blue crews and GM supercruise things like that. It's the level 4 and 5 where there is no steering wheel perhaps, and you're not doing anything. That is like what John was saying, beyond five years from now. Not next year, 5, 10, who knows, 15. I think that's the problem. There's sort of a scene that would Argo. They couldn't raise new funds and it's both VW and Ford thought, hey, you know what? Let's pull the plug, bring these guys in-house, and we're working on those L2L3 solutions. Do you think this is a surprise to the industry? Is this going to have ripple effects as far as other automakers that are also going into? Full autonomy. I think there's two parts there, right? So the surprise headline from yesterday of this happening was a huge surprise. No one saw this happening, no one saw it coming. In fact, Argo was talking about expanding into other markets just only a month or two ago. But I think the writing's been on the wall for a while because we have seen this uptake being so slow, the challenges are still there. We kind of industry analysts sort of seen that this might take some time. But at this first time we're seeing Ford and also like someone in the industry players saying that this actually is very challenging. We may not see this through for a long time. So that was surprising. What about this argument that it's been around for years, which is that essentially, you know, even with these investments in placing this is kind of where the future is headed, we've heard Elon Musk talk a lot about how, you know, 80% of the time your car is parked. So you can, you know, if you've got fully autonomous driving, then you can actually have somebody else take over the car when you're basically not driving. And I mean, does all that use case sort of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,25,2022-10-27 15:30:33
4247," And if you've got fully autonomous driving, then you can actually have somebody else take over the car when you're basically not driving. And I mean, does all that use case sort of break down? I think if you're Tesla, they would say, no, we're so working on that robot taxi car in one of his steering wheel, and we want it to be sort of running around when you're not using it. But I think this shows you how difficult that is, and maybe that is showing a little kind of crack in the armor that maybe this AI autonomous stuff is not fully there yet, and it needs a lot more computing power or whatever else needed to actually make the solution happen. Does this get more strength to Tesla, you think? I don't know. I know we're going to talk about this later, but they're under investigation potentially. For some potentially misleading claims about that, we'll see if that actually leads in criminal wise. But I think that it just shows the doubt that's there right now. And maybe that we should be focusing more on the L2L3 where we can drive on the highway, take your hands off the wheel, it can follow a car, maybe even exit off park. I think it's very important. Yeah, yeah, no, that's a big deal. I think those L2L3 stuff is like, that's actually usable stuff happening now. That's very useful, and it kind of takes a strain off driving. So maybe we'll see more of a lean in on that, and more of the futuristic stuff is way more, it's going to mars first. And perhaps it's not for everybody. Perhaps this isn't something where you're going to have everybody driving without their hands on the steering wheel at all. Perhaps it's going to be a combination. Yeah, you know, real quick, I think there's seen that more with trucks where you're doing this long haul, just going straight somewhere. You're not doing a lot of engaging with other people and other cars. There might be the way the better use case for an autonomous technology going forward. Proz Subarinian, thanks so much. And staying with the car sector shares of auto nation, where you there, you can see those are up right now. After the company reported third quarter, adjusted net income fell, 7% as profits from use vehicle slump, the automotive retailer also announced a billion dollar in share buybacks. It's worth remembering. The impact use car prices have had on the inflation princess year, this component of the CPI basket was once an afterthought, but rocketed really in 2022 and is now finally cooling. And coming up, off the rails, another union rejects that major of a tentative labor deal, raising the chances of a costly freight strike. Is it really on the cards or is this just cost-string? We discuss next. Stay with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,26,2022-10-27 15:34:45
4248," You We're back out now working with the BMW to try to figure out a temporary agreement that can be taken back out for ratification. I anticipate we're going to be able to do that. Maintenance away employees could drag over into next year. I don't anticipate that. I think there's a there's a path forward for us to get another tense to have agreement. Get it back out for vote. And that was Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz on our air. Exactly. One week ago, suggesting that ongoing railroad union votes need to get done this year, but more than 60% of the brotherhood of railroad signalmen fail to ratify. And if the railroads fail to reach a deal, we could see a strike as soon as November 19th. Yahoo finances. Rick Newman has the latest rick. So we seem to have seen a scenario like this before. Is there a possible strike on the table? Yes, but importantly, it is not going to happen if it does happen until after the midterm elections on November 8th. So when this first came up, President Biden directed the Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, he basically said, get this resolved. And it looked like it was resolved in October. But then we had one union that said, no, we're not ratifying this. And now we have a second one. So my best guess is they will get this resolved without a strike. But if they don't, it's a big deal because of all the goods that travel by rail. And we've already got problems with supply chains that are put one of the factors pushing prices up with to 8.2% inflation and higher for some things like food. So the government needs to get involved to get this resolved, which I think it probably will, but it may go down to the wire close to November 19th. Meanwhile, overseas, Rick, we have the party Congress now wrapped up over in China. Looks like what sounds like a bit of an all-advance coming from President Xi Jinping saying, look, we need to work with the U.S. This coming ahead of a potential meeting. I mean, how what are we to make of it? It sounds very welcome to tell you the truth. I mean, the U.S.-China relationship has been deteriorating for one thing we've had all this chatter about whether China may invade Taiwan, which they're probably not going to do anytime soon, if ever. But there have been reasons to worry about that. There's been so-called saber rattling. Then you had this new move in Washington with these, really, what are the strictest export controls ever on U.S. computer chip technology going into China, basically a ban on advanced computer chip technology, U.S. technology going to China. So we have kind of a cold economic war developing here. And there have been some questions about whether Xi would do something to retaliate for those export controls. Now, he still may do that. But to hear him say, oh, you know, we're going to find ways to get along here. I think that's encouraging. And if you're a big U.S. multinational that has operations in China, that's what you would like to hear. So, you know, the two nations are, do remain economically interdependent. So if you've got at least one leader saying, let's work things out. That's good news. Yeah, I mean, better to keep the conversation going is to point out because we are looking at the number one into economies in the world. Rick Newman, as always, thank you so much for that. Well, today's U.S. GDP number offered some relief, but economists and analysts alike suggest that any excitement over the numbers is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,27,2022-10-27 15:38:45
4249," Thank you so much for that. Well, today's US GDP number have offered summer leave, but it caught us an analyst alike to just that any excitement over the numbers is overdone because of one-off factors that skewed the reading. Our chart of the day definitely doesn't offer much in the way of hope. Sadly, the Bloomberg chart here shows the three-month 10-year spread, which is flashing recession alarm bells. You're probably thinking the 2-10 spread is the one of the experts watch. Well, this one is in fact a preferred recession indicator of the New York Fed. So well worth a closer look. Well, the International Energy Agency now says that drop in Russian gas exports after its invasion of Ukraine will transform the global energy landscape. The agency's executive director, Fatib Errol, said energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come. And as this was part of the world energy outlook that the IEA puts out every year, it's interesting because so much of the conversation, at least in the U.S., you could argue globally too has been about supply constraints, whether in fact the transition to green energy has been happening so quickly. But a few timelines to note here. Number one, Fatib Errol says, look, despite what we're hearing, this, this, as in what's been happening between Russia and Ukraine, the global concerns around supply has actually accelerated investments in clean energy. Natural gas usage is likely to peak by the end of the decade, coal in the next few years, and then oil in the mid-2030. So that's sort of the timeline we're looking at right now. Some welcome news, but at the same time, you know, those who have been pushing for more aggressive targets have said, look, this still doesn't get us to capping temperatures at one and a half degrees by 2050, which is what we have heard over and over through the Paris Agreement. That this is what's needed to sort of avert the worst-case scenario on climate change. Exactly, but I think the important point that you pointed out is that this does sort of accelerate these efforts by countries to go into greener energies. And in fact, this IEA report also points to by 2030, pointing to the US inflation reduction act that annual solar and wind capacity additions in the US will grow two and a half times over today's levels, electric cars, sales, seven times higher. So this certainly does accelerate going into greener energies. Now, those in the fossil fuel world will say that you still need fossil in order to go green, but nonetheless, it is a demand that will be accelerating here. And we even see it with consumers. I mean, consumers that are looking at solar panels to put on the top of their roofs because they want to pay less for their electricity. Yeah, and the IEA saying that, look, this is not just a conversation about climate change anymore. This is about energy security in countries increasingly looking to renewable as part of a way to reinforce that energy independence, especially in light of what has been playing out between Russia and Ukraine. That's right. And coming up, our economicists, McDonald's beats the street on the top and bottom lines, but the strong dollar takes a toll on the numbers due to the fast food chains hefty foreign exposure. We, too, over the report next, yes. We'll choose. We'll get away from that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,28,2022-10-27 15:43:38
4250," Battez Investors are loving and McDonald's latest quarterly performance. The stock is up nearly 3% after the company reported strong sales boosted by higher prices in Q3. Yaku'n finances, Brooke DiPolma, on the earnings call. Brooke, can we just get the jingle out? You have to say I'm loving it. I'm loving it. I had to say that it certainly shares up 3% today after McDonald's came out with this report this morning noting that marketing efforts in the stronger or rather higher enterprises driving this quarter, but largely offset from that strength of the US dollar. If we take a close look at some takeaways from the earnings call this morning, we found that US consumers are getting fewer items per order. Drive that was back to pretty COVID levels. This is the highest delivery sales quarter that McDonald's has ever seen. They didn't know that more people are heading back into restaurants or seeing about a 70% flow rate there. But if we do take a look at what we're really keeping an eye on this quarter, the low income consumer. They're saying that they're seeing a bit of trade down among low income consumers and a shift from meal purchases to more value orders. Of course, McDonald's known for its value menu there. And also too, they continue to say that as inflation continues to tick up, they expect to benefit from a mile to moderate recession here noting that that food away from home category is less pricey than those groceries, of course. But if we take a look at Europe, consumer sentiment low there. They're noting that inflation can take its toll on price of food and energy there. They made the step in some urge during COVID and help franchise these. Marketing here though, a big push this quarter with that camp McDonald's. They also did give us a quick insight on that cactus flea market box. They sold at 50% of the collectibles during the first four days. And you'd be happy to know the McRibb. They's compared it to Tom Brady, Michael Jordan. They're never officially retired with it. So that's my own back. No, no, no, come back. All right, let's ring in Peter Salay, VTIG Managing Director and Restaurant Analyst for a further dive. Peter, you know what, to me it's interesting to hear what feels like is becoming a common theme among some of these restaurant chains. Higher prices are helped offsetting higher costs. We're seeing trade downs from low income consumers. What stood out to you in the numbers that we got today? Yeah, well, I think what stood out was that, you know, McDonald's in the US had positive traffic. Not many restaurants today have positive traffic. So positive traffic in the US consumers are not necessarily pushing back on the higher prices, which are up about 10% year over year, despite all the inflation that we're seeing. Also, I think the second thing that stood out is their performance in the IOM market over in Europe with about three.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,29,2022-10-27 15:47:41
4251," over year despite all the inflation that we're seeing. Also, I think the second thing that stood out is their performance in the IOM market over in Europe was about 300 basis points better than consensus, about 200 basis points better than us. That, I think, allayed some of the fears around the street. There's a lot of concern that all the turmoil in Europe was really gonna weigh down the same store sales there. So I think on the top line, we just had those two really stuck out, positive traffic in the US, and really good strong performance in Europe, really driven by Germany, we saw Australia and France as well. And I wanna take a closer look here at those overseas markets. They noted that China not quite back to where it was pre-COVID-JS-00 due to those zero policy lockdowns. They also noted that they might it's provide support in Europe for those franchisees. Looking to the next quarter, what exactly are you hoping that McDonald's does and steps it in order to offset the price of food, paper, and energy overseas? Yeah, look, I think they're just telling you that, hey, you know, our franchisees, things make it worse over in Europe. And if we need to, we'll step in. They don't wanna surprise anybody, we'll step in and we'll provide support like they did here in the US during the pandemic. So I think they don't, again, they don't wanna surprise anybody. So I think we're gonna, we'll likely see that. But right now, we're seeing strength. Yes, there's a lot of inflation, but the consumers just are not pushing back. And I think, you know, most interestingly, we're starting to see some evidence of commodities moderating here. We saw that yesterday when we spoke to Wingstop, they were talking about, you know, kind of deflation in wings and chicken right through the, at least the first quarter, if not the first half of the year, we think we're gonna continue to see some moderating deflation as we go into 2023. And given all the pricing that the restaurants have taken, I think that could set them up for some margin expansion, which really nobody's anticipating at this point. And Peter, you're saying the consumer is not pushing back. If we go into a recession, if you believe we're not in one yet, or we go into a deeper one, going into 2023, where does that leave restaurants like McDonald's? Because it does seem that the lower income consumers is trading down, but yet it is a place where, if you were an upper income consumer, or middle income consumer, you would be going to a place like McDonald's during a recession. So is there really a downside to them if we go into a recession? Well, I think if we go into a recession, the fine recession really, look, if consumers have jobs historically in the US when unemployment is low, and there's job growth, restaurants hold up fairly well, and there seems to be a thousand traffic hold up fairly well. So if we go into a recession where we start to lose jobs and unemployment goes up, that's when I think you'll see consumers start to push back. Bottom line is consumers still have to eat. So you're either eating at the grocery store, or you're eating at restaurants. Grocery store pricing is up more so than restaurant pricing. So at this point, restaurants are actually providing a little bit more value than they have historically. And generally speaking, Peter, we've been hearing from top executives that customers are more aware of their spending habits like you're saying in this environment, but that's not the case at Chipotle. At least that's what the CFO told us, told Yahoo Finance, take a listen here. We don't think Chipotle is the brand that somebody's looking for a dollar menu or a bundled meal. They come to look for customization, real culinary, and they crave the food that most customers get the same exact on-trade every single time. And that's what they crave. Now, do you think consumers will continue to bear higher prices at Chipotle and the likes of it? And to add to that, do you think we might see some Chipotle customers coming to McDonald's? I don't believe in that trade down of that consumer from upper-end fast casual to McDonald's to save a 50 cents or a buck if even that. I just don't believe it. I think consumers are gonna go after what they really want. Yes, within McDonald's, you are seeing some trade down from lower-end consumers trading down to some value items from the higher price.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,30,2022-10-27 15:51:47
4252," go after what they really want. Yes, within McDonald's, you are seeing some trade down from lower-end consumers trading down to some value items from the higher priced combo meals. You know, I don't think we're seeing any real evidence of that at Chipotle of consumers trading down. Was their traffic down a percent? It's really not the end of the world. Some consumers may be opting to come a little bit less frequently. That is possible. But keep in mind that their traffic on a two and three-year basis is up significantly. So, you know, I don't see the trade down effect really hurting Chipotle at this point. Peter, finally, we're just showing some of the other restaurant chains on the board there. When you think about where things are headed, you know, in an economic downturn, who do you think offers the most value? So, in an economic downturn, I think restaurants that have, you know, a value bundle, I think, if you look at the pizza space in general, you can feed a family of four for around 30 bucks. I would tell you, I don't think you can do that from really any other restaurants. So, in terms of overall value, I think that pizza space has the most value in an economic downturn, but we're not there right now. Consumers still have jobs. Consumers are still spending. We're not really in a consumer-led economic downturn. Maybe the overall markets are weaker, but that's not really translating into weaker consumer spending at this point. Yes, some important contacts there. Peter Saleh, BTIG, Managing Director, and Restaurant Analyst. Appreciate your time today, and our thanks to Brooke as well.

4253," mistakes along the way into your stroke. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Tesla CEO Elon Musk walking into Twitter headquarters on Wednesday carrying his sink and tweeting out entering Twitter headquarters. Let that sink in. Get it? Musk is at 05 PM on Friday to complete the deal to buy Twitter. We'll face the proposition of going to trial. By the way, Elon Musk also tweeting out earlier today about why or reminding us all why he decided to acquire the company as we get closer to this deal being completed saying the reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence. And as it feels like we've been talking about this every single day for the last few months, could it finally be happening? And it's happening tomorrow. Twitter will be delicious. I mean, I think that him walking in with a sink and saying, let that sink in in his tweet. I think that that was also comedic relief. So to speak, entering in with some comedy there, because after all of the drama that we've seen with this Twitter deal, I think it was a pretty smart move. Yet as a welcome for the employees there, a few moves to look for as we get closer to this finalizing. Of course, as and as mentioned, Twitter shares because he is taking the company private to be delisted, at least according to the New York Stock Exchange. Tomorrow, we are seeing it trade up. Remember that price? 5420. It's getting close to that. But it's trading at 5394 right now. And we should also point out that Elon Musk officially buying Twitter, also seeing a pop and dogecoin. A lot of people saying, is he going to integrate that into the platform up 14% right now, dogecoin. But keep in mind, it was out above 60 cents per dogecoin last year, May last year. Okay. We're certainly going to be talking about all this tomorrow. Twitter potentially could be under Elon Musk control by 5pm Eastern. We're going to be watching the story and much more. That does it for an as in this hour. We've got much more to come here and Yahoo Finance live. It's going to be big earnings from Apple in Amazon later today.

4254,"BLE $15.50. $13.50. $15.50. The EAT as its higher income clientele was able to absorb higher prices for burritos and burritos. Bulls, the company did warn on two fronts. Store traffic and spending trends among lower income consumers. Chipotle, CFO, Jack Hartung joins us now to discuss. Jack, always nice to see you you, on the conference call last night, I thought you guys were defending the price increases that you have pushed through, noting the high big portion sizes and what you do in terms of cutting ingredients. Do you think, or are you just concerned about some of the price points on some of the products now? No, you don't probably, we watch this very, very closely. And when we've raised prices over the last couple of years, and let's face it, it's been a high inflationary period. It's been the highest inflation I've seen in my entire career. When we take prices, we've looked at a number of things. We look at what our competitors are charging. We look at what happened the last time we took a price increase, and are we seeing any evidence that customers are either trading down or if they're reducing their transactions. And everything we see looks good. I know this is an environment where we have macro challenges. We talked about on the call that we do have some of our lower income consumers. Our peer and back on their dining out experiences, including at Chipotle, but our higher income customers are actually coming more often. So they're not having, we're not seeing any kind of change in their behavior based on any of the pricing action that we've taken over the last year and a half. Jack, you know what I mean? I go to Chipotle all the time, but are you concerned that a portion of the US is getting shut out of that really good Chipotle experience? And that now maybe you need to touch that third rail and do a value meal or maybe cut the bull in half and do $5 bull to get consumers in. Yeah, you know, Brian, we had this exact discussion the last time during the Great Recession where we saw consumers did start to reduce their dining experiences. And with Chipotle, during that time, even though our comms held up better than every other restaurant company, we stayed positive throughout that entire time. Our transactions were actually slightly negative, but negative. So we did see some transactions actually dip. As the recession was starting to end, our transactions came roaring back and we had double digit comms from there. So we've seen this before and during that time we did talk about should we offer value meals? Should we offer a bundled meal where the consumers can eat for at the time it was less than $5? Our customers said, great idea. Go ahead and do it. And then when we tested it in restaurants, nobody bought it because everyone said, well, I love my chicken burrito. So I'm coming from my chicken burrito or my steak burrito. So we don't think Chipotle is the brand that somebody's looking for a dollar menu or a bundled meal. They come to look for customization, real culinary. And they crave the food that most customers get the same exact on trade every single time. And that's what they crave. And so, and when we look at our chicken burrito, which is what more than half of our customers get compared to competitors, we're under $9 for chicken burrito. And when you get a chicken on trade at other fast casuals, you can't find any for under $10. And typically it's in that $11 to $13 range. So we still think we're at great value. Jack, what about the people that come to Chipotle for lunch, particularly? And when it relates to that traffic, how you're looking through where some of the office occupancy that still isn't at pre-pandemic levels and is still in some cases data from casual suggesting it's lower than 50% of that pre-pandemic level and really only expected to take up sometime in 2023. What would you be tracking with regard to the relation of return to work or return to office and how that plays out for Chipotle going into next year? Yeah, when we look at our urban restaurants and we've got, urban restaurants are a relative minority of our entire portfolio of over 3000 restaurants. So we've got somewhere in that 100 to 150 restaurants that are true urban. When we look at that cohort comparison.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,33,2022-10-27 16:04:56
4255," for urban restaurants and we've got, urban restaurants are a relative minority of our entire portfolio of over 3000 restaurants. So we've got somewhere not 100 to 150 restaurants that are true urban. When we look at that cohort compared to all of the restaurants, they've been outcompanying the rest of the system for the last year or year and half or so. And that makes sense, based on people are returning to the office now. It's not all the way back, but I would say it's within kind of 10 or 15% in terms of where the urban restaurants are compared to non-urban. So it's not all the way back, but it's not like it's anywhere nearer. You mentioned the 50% occupancy. We're doing way better than that. Hey, Jack, it's Julie here. So transactions down by about 1% last quarter. Do you have any sense of what that number could be this quarter? And I guess I'm trying to get a feel for where you think we are in the cycle. We're all grappling this morning, looking at big tech earnings about how much worse things could get. From your perspective, how are you thinking about that question? Yeah, we have a unique challenge in the fourth quarter because we introduced as a limited time offer, brisket last year in the fourth quarter, and it was highly, highly successful. So we're comparing against that very, very difficult comparison. So contributing to the quarter is, it's going to be a little bit more negative transactions. We think it's going to move from the 1% down that you mentioned in the third quarter to somewhere in the low to maybe the mid-single digit transaction being down in the fourth quarter. But as we move away, brisket, we actually could only secure enough supply to run that promotion through the middle and then that's how successful it was. Once we get past that, we think that the comparison will get a little bit easier. But we do think from a macro standpoint that the lower end consumers are dining out less often. So we do think that that's going to be a challenge for not just to pollate, but I think the restaurant industry for probably the next few of not several quarters. Jack, I don't know if you can see, but my out of finance team never sees it to amaze me. You know, we have some of the photos. There I am right there about a week ago in the base short, Chipotle. I got my usual order that is all for me. Two bowls right there. I ordered the same thing last night. I went to pick it up $48.23. Now I could double me and I understand. But do you think you could put... Let's see some guac on there too. Yeah, there's a lot going on there. I get it. But do you think you could push through more price? I'm still shopping in there. I'm still going to Chipotle, but do you still have more room to push through more price increase in the fourth quarter next year you think? So I think we do, Brian, when... I mean, listen, many people eat like you do. I think the tribute to... I don't know if you're exercise or team, but the fact that you can eat two bowls like that, you look as good as you do. I can say that. That's why we always have you on. But I do think we have room, but we don't have any plans right now to raise prices again. It depends on commodities, but what I do know is that when we look at competitors, others have raised prices to over less. So the gap in terms of value for Chipotle compared to the others still exists. But right now, if commodities behave themselves, we don't have any plans to take any more price for a while. OK, and so in the near term then, because you've still got the affluent consumers or the people that are ordering double guac, double meat, like Brian and we were coming in. You know, when you think about the ticket sizes that you're seeing, is there a Zoom-Din? Is there a material difference in ticket size? Even among the outsized affluent consumer that you're seeing make up the majority of the revenues right now? It's not huge. There is like a mid-single digit difference. It's a slight difference. Really the difference is, and this is what tells us it's more about a macro. It's not that people are resisting, you know, when we raise prices, it's 4% on an $8 or $9.00 burrito. It's 30, 40 cents. So we don't think that consumers are affected by that 30 or 40 cents. We think consumers are deciding, can I eat out at all? Or if I'm going to eat out, do I have to, you know, maybe go down to another class to traditional QSR? Because it's just a different category for them. Jack, good to see you. Chipotle, see a faux jack carton talking us through the quarter and what's beyond. Thanks so much. Thank you guys.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,34,2022-10-27 16:09:28
4256," you you you you last hard out FX, PC, which of these do you see actually being able to abate in the near term of all of the headwinds that they mentioned and how can Microsoft successfully navigate this period? Sure you bet. So clearly, you know, you're starting to see kind of the macro pressure start to erode into the growth outlook for Microsoft. If you look at the cloud business, it actually still pretty healthy, it's slowing, but we still expect the cloud business to grow north to 20% this year, a little slower than we thought originally six months ago. It's really the more economically sensitive parts of Microsoft. That's still a big business. That's still a $100 billion business. It has been growing across windows and PCs and surface devices and gaming. That's a that's a $100 billion plus business that has been growing 4% plus for the last two three years. It could actually decline double digits this next quarter. So it's really, that's really where we're seeing that the slowdown in in in those more cyclically sensitive areas, more of the consumer areas, the commercial still holding up pretty well. So that's sort of in line with what we've been hearing from from what the commentary we've been getting ahead of the earning season from the likes of a sales force, for example, that have seemed to indicate the business spending is holding up pretty well. But how long does that last? If the cyclical stuff is rolling over, can we expect it at some point to also affect the more enterprise spending? Absolutely. And you're just now starting to see small cracks in the cloud growth rate. If you look at Azure, it's one of the fastest growing parts of the cloud business for Microsoft. That growth profile is decelled by about 9 percentage points in about three quarters. So you absolutely are seeing slowdown. It's still good growth, right? 37% in constant currencies with the guided to this coming quarter. That's down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,35,2022-10-27 16:13:17
4257," So you absolutely are seeing slowdown. It's still good growth, right? 37% in constant currencies with the guided to this coming quarter. That's down from 47% over the last couple of years. So it's slowing. We're seeing signs of maybe some budgetary pressure on the enterprise side. That's going to flow through into next year as well. So we certainly wouldn't say enterprise software, cloud is immune to the macro. And we're now starting to see cracks. Brent, clearly a challenging quarter for Microsoft outside of your, excuse me, your coverage universe or outside of Microsoft. Are there other companies that you think will be impacted to the same extent as Microsoft? Sure, we actually took numbers down on 22 stocks last week, including cutting numbers by Microsoft by 3 billion. Clearly wasn't enough. We took another $7 billion cut to our Microsoft numbers this morning. But yeah, we think there really isn't a safe haven in software. I think the macro pressures will eventually impact growth rates for most of the enterprise software names that we cover. So I think the good news is valuations are started at bottom. So I think there's no longer a valuation risk. The challenge fundamentals have not bottomed yet. So we still have a bottoming process to go through on the fundamental side. We need to see growth expectations for next year reset. And we're getting close, but certainly have to go through a fundamental trough before you start to see stabilization. What type of growth profile would you give at this point to Microsoft's cloud business considering the pull forward and demand that we'd seen over the past couple years? Yeah, so it's interesting. We look at the broader cloud market. The cloud 100 if you will growth was 33% in 2021. We're modeling about 22% cloud industry growth in 2022. That's similar to where Microsoft cloud is at. Next year, we're actually sub 20% growth for industry, about 19.5% industry cloud industry growth expectations. That's essentially I think directionally where Microsoft's headed as well. High teens growth in a recessionary environment seems like a good kind of landing spot for this industry. That's down from 33. So that is a material slowdown, but still really good growth for an industry that could be north of $300 billion in 2023 with valuations sitting where they are right now. Do you think that Microsoft, especially within this cloud landscape, needs to make a key acquisition and strike while the opportunity might be there to go after a company that could help it grow out of its portfolio? In the cloud a little bit better. Listen, Microsoft's still the cloud king. It's the only cloud company north of $100 billion in revenue. It's still kind of growing. Poise to grow 20% in constant currency. So could they do more? Absolutely. Should they do more? Absolutely. Do I think they will do more? Absolutely. So $17 billion in cash, $65 billion in cash flow. Microsoft's not done from an M&A standpoint in cloud. We tried them the active next year. Absolutely. Times three. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.

4258," you you your. keep on upright and doclative and a four before final a good quarter from a tail, with the ninth straight quarter of year of year growth in constant currency. Look, as you know, we are in the midst of a challenging economic environment, but our year-to-date results of double-digit growth in net sales, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS, showed that we are successfully navigating a complex landscape, and our strategy is working. We believe our fundamentals are strong, and we are very confident about our multi-year growth trajectory. And Anna, I've been covering you in the turnaround story, Mattel, for a good bit. Now, I wasn't used to that tone on that conference call last night, just highlighting some slowing you're seeing in the market. How severe is that gun? Look, there's no, it's not a secret that the economy, the broader economy is currently challenging. But our year-to-date result do show and do demonstrate that we are on the right track. We are maintaining guidance for full-year growth in net sales in constant currency of 8 to 10 percent and look forward to the holiday season. We modestly revised our profit expectation to allow and accommodate for the inflation that we're seeing, but we still expect a growth year for Mattel, both at the top line and the bottom line, and also expect 2023 to be a growth year, both top line and bottom line. So we are very confident about our trajectory. Brands are resonating, thriving with the continued engagement and cultural impact, and we're very confident about our strategy and execution. You did highlight the need that there might be a little more promotions in the holiday quarter than I think a lot of investors may be expected. How much discounting do you expect to be doing? Look, according to date, consumer demand is a non-with expectation and we're pleased with our performance. Shoppers are returning to traditional purchasing patterns closer to the holiday and we expect demand to accelerate. We are working closely with our retail partners to meet the anticipated demand. We have more advertising and promotion, we secured more shelf space and retailer support compared to last year, and we also expect to, and also we have great holiday toilies representation and much stronger in stock. So yes, we are going to increase promotion and activity, but we are well positioned for the fourth quarter and the holiday season, which is why we are maintaining our full year guidance of net sales growth in 8-10% in constant currency. No, I'm old, I'm not as close as I used to be. What are some of the top toils in the holiday season? Well, Mansahai is going to be a very exciting offering as we prepare for the global launch next year. Hot Wheels Car Wash, Lightyear products, Fisher Price has a great musical toy called Bouncing Beats. And the sports favorite is PL cuando el sonor hace dt வع you no. The purchase of items from L gemeinsam Games and MSR is similar to our one crore auto industryfeels got a video and have never seen startup product from a processor",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,37,2022-10-27 16:22:16
4259," next year. Hot Wheels car wash, light-year products, Fisher Price has a great musical toy called Bouncing Beats, and the Dreamhouse, of course, will always be on the top of the Toilest for every holiday season. So an exciting broad offering across a pretty large spectrum of product that we're very excited about. I remember having one of those car washes as a kid, and I've got to send your photo exists somewhere, but these are some cool toys. That is an interesting stuff. How is the pricing on these compared to last year? Do you plan to take more pricing? Look, we increased pricing in the second half of this year. We were able to successfully implement those increases, and it's too early to tell, but so far we haven't seen a meaningful impact on consumer demand. Important to say that as it relates to inflation, we are beginning to see some improvement in the cost of ocean freight and materials. We expect inflation to moderate in 2023, and in addition to the savings that we're looking to generate of $250 million. By the end of 23 we expect the combination of pricing and cost savings to more than offset cost inflation and contribute to margin expansion over time. So we are actively managing our business in this environment to ensure that we are set up for long-term success. You may be the first CEO that we've talked to to really highlight a peak in inflation and things cooling off a bit. I certainly, certainly that is a good to hear in a different tone. Let's go on to Barbie, because Barbie has been an interesting story the past year or two here. A real growth mechanism for the company. What's on tap for that brand next year? Very confident about the long-term growth trajectory of Barbie. Barbie was the number one global doll property in the third quarter and year to date. Year to date Barbie is up, which is an excellent achievement when compared to last year, which was the highest on record for Barbie of all times. We look forward to next year, which will have an exciting innovation pipeline, new content slate with Netflix, and of course the highly anticipated Barbie movie. Our first theatrical release that will come out this summer. Also important to know that Barbie doubled in size over the past five years and was the number one global toy property overall, not just in dolls, but overall in the last two years. We really see that as a proof point to the strength of this incredible franchise. Very confident about Barbie and proud to have it as our leading franchise. It does seem like a nine and we've talked about this in the past. You've all the seeds that you have plans in terms of content and of course you highlight the Barbie movie are now coming to fruition. This will start to hit the market next year and beyond. How much will you spend on content next year? Well, we employ a capital-wide strategy. We're not spending money on content. We're leveraging our brands. We collaborate with the best filmmakers and content creators out there, both not just film but also in television, and partner with major studios to create, produce, distribute and commercialize our brands on the big screen and also in episodic content. We have a very exciting slate of 14 additional movies other than Barbie that we currently developing with some of the best and most prolific creators of this generation. This is going to grow because we have more in the pipeline that we have announced. Likewise, Mattel television is thriving with 12 series and specials that will be on air this year, so to speak, because some are actually by streaming. Eight of those are new for a returning. Months-to-high-lab action television movie musical, just launch an ecology and we grinlit the second movie and we continue to roll out more content such as Thomas and friends, polypocket, fireman Sam, DeepAnerNoop, more Barbie product, Pictionary Gameshow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,38,2022-10-27 16:26:22
4260," more content such as Thomas and friends, polypocket, fireman Sam, deep-pen and loop, more Barbie product, dictionary game show, and the list goes on and on. So, exciting to see how our brands resonate with consumers and attract creators to collaborate with us, because like us, they're also very excited to reimagine and create an expression of our product in content. When's the Pokemon movie heading in on? Well, we licensed recently the Pokemon brand, which is one of the strongest franchises this year, for mega, for building sets. It's been a great driver for us, and we're very proud to work with the Pokemon company in expressing their IP in combination with our product. So, it's a great partnership. And this really speaks to how we elevate material to become the partner of choice for the major entertainment companies, and where we bring our capabilities, our global scale, our innovation, our supply chain and commercial capabilities, collaborate with other owners, other franchises, and take them to the next level, and create evergreen franchises, just like we do with our own. Now, I'm just being flagged before I let you go, and there was just a new Pokemon movie, Detective Pikachu. That's how you know you're getting old, but you do not realize those types of movies are in the market. We'll leave it there for now. Good luck to Solidities and Mattelcio, and I'm Chris. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you so much. Well, shares of Alphabet are sliding into the red app for missing estimates on the top and bottom lines. The Tech Giant's revenue growth slowed to 6% from 41% the prior year, as ad spending continues its downward trend. Lapping from a strong third quarter last year, may present tough comps across Alphabet's portfolio, including search and YouTube. Take a listen to what we heard from Google and Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat on the earnings call.

4261," reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spend. In the fourth quarter, the very strong revenue performance last year will continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year on year growth rates of advertising revenues. Joining us to break this all down, we've got Bob O'Donnell, technologist research at President, at Chief Analyst for more on the impact type companies are starting to feel from an economic slowdown. Bob, we've got you in the flesh. I'd so great to be back. Live in the studio, it's crazy. Certainly a good day to break this all down. We're going to start with the alphabet because you know, we were saying before the show that it's interesting to see how significantly they were affected, especially in digital ads. When you think about the last quarter, there's a bit of a divergence between the social media companies. Alphabet has a bit more of a diversified portfolio but they weren't shielded this time around. No, I mean, because obviously, alphabet gets searched and we're always going to search and people are always going to do that. And so they always have that that they can fall back on as part of the advertising side. But the social media side and the YouTube side of things, that's where they took the hit. And that's because we're seeing, obviously, overall advertising going down in those places. And the other challenge that you've got with alphabet is it's not really that diversified a company, right? There's so much dependence upon advertising. I mean, look, they do have Google Cloud, which they didn't really talk too much about that. But they have a few things that are bubbling up, but they're still small. I saw the other day that other bets. Remember, when they used to talk about other bets, it's 0.3% of the company's revenue. So I mean, I think that's one of the ongoing challenges. They're going to figure these things out. They are building their business not only on the enterprise side, I should say, not only for Google Cloud, but also Google Workspace, some of their other services where they compete with Microsoft. And that's been growing and it continues to grow. It's going to take a while before it becomes a huge contributor to the bottom line. But there are these elements that are in play and then are moving forward for them. What was your takeaway, though, from what we heard in terms of where things are headed? And it seemed like they were sort of setting things up for an even more significant downturn. And to your point, yes, it's not as diversified as a company like Microsoft, but in terms of where the ad revenue and where they compete in, it is a little more diversified than the likes of Meta, or so. Yes, no, it definitely is. And look, I think what we're seeing in a lot of ways across tech is a sense of the things that people expected to happen at the beginning of the pandemic didn't, and now they kind of are. It's sort of like it's a two and a half year delay of the big impact that people thought was going to have. I think in general, we're seeing that tech companies having weathered so well are now facing the challenges that other parts of the market have faced. And it's just that's the reality. Growth is going to slow down. And on the advertising side, of course, that's a reflection of overall macroeconomic trends. And there's not a whole lot they can do about that. And I think that's a challenge. Obviously, there's not many more places they can go. I mean, Google is everywhere, and there's stuff is everywhere. So it's really going to be dependent upon how the general macroeconomic does so that those companies that feel more confident, they're advertisers, as I should say, feel more confident in spending the money with a platform like Google. Let's talk about Microsoft. Obviously, Azure has been the big growth driver there. And you have said in your notes that because it is more enterprise-safed facing, they are a little more shielded. And yet, what we heard yesterday, I think it was on the call from Google saying essentially, yes, companies are still investing in the cloud, but they're taking a little longer and maybe thinking a little harder about how much they want to invest. So are we likely to see further headwinds for Microsoft, even if Azure is the driver? I think we will, and the issue is it's easy forget that only about, I think the numbers, last numbers I heard were 15 to 20% of companies have moved their workloads to the cloud. I shouldn't say of companies, of the potential workloads. And so there's still this huge potential upside to move to cloud computing from all the big platforms. And the other thing to bear in mind is we've had these incredibly strong growth rates for cloud computing across the board, AWS, obviously, Microsoft. And at some point, you can't last, right? It's the law of big numbers. You run into a certain point where it's very difficult. The thing is,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,40,2022-10-27 16:35:14
4262," US obviously Microsoft and at some point, you can't last, right? It's the law of big numbers. You run into a certain point where it's very difficult. The thing is, even as things start to slow down a bit, a lot of companies started big initiatives during the pandemic that are cloud computing-based and they are going to continue those. Like you said, as the commentary said, some of those projects are going to slow down a little bit. They're not quite as high priority, perhaps, as they were, but they're still going to do it because it's still part of these companies really trying to transform their businesses. And that's an essential part of survival, in the next decade. We're still waiting on numbers from meta. We've got to alphabet or Amazon and Apple later on in the week. It's sort of interesting to see how the narrative around tech has changed because for a while, it was about the social media companies. And yet, when you think at where we are in the current court, it feels like we're going back to these established players if we can call that, it has come down to Apple, it comes down to Microsoft. How are you looking at your portfolio of those tech names and where are the safe bets? Yeah, no, I mean, I think we are falling back to the most trusted tech brands. And the big names are going to be the ones that are going to, I think, make it through this. The other thing is, again, these companies over the years have become increasingly diversified. Now, in the case of meta, I think it's a challenge, right? Obviously, very advertising focused, a very consumer-based advertising focus. So likely, it's going to be tough. Apple, everybody loves to say, well, one of these days, something's going to catch up to Apple. But what Apple magically manages to do every quarter is somehow get different elements of the puzzle to add together. There have been rumblings that iPhone 14 sales, for example, have been lower than expected. So they've apparently cut the production. And so people say, oh, we'll see, iPhone's going to be down. But remember now, the iPhone is less than 50% of the revenue. They've built up this huge install base. They continue to sell services, right? Everything from Apple TV and all the other services they have, that's driving their growth. They're also doing more, obviously, with AirPods and the watch and other elements of their ecosystem. So they've managed to create this, I think, pretty diverse story. Similar in Amazon, right? I mean, Amazon is very dichotomous. You've got AWS, which just cranks out revenue and cranks out dollars. And then you've got the online sales business, which, realistically, is probably going to take a hit. And if it's going to be like any of the other retail environments. But the question is, is there enough on the AWS side to offset some of that? It's hard to tell, for sure. But again, it's that story of diversification that these big tech companies have done over the years. And I think we're going to start to see the benefits of that. But clearly, at more of a reduced kind of a normal rate, not the huge multiples that they've gotten. Yeah, a lot of investors are going to be parsing those numbers, or breaking down those numbers closely. Bob, great to have you in studios, right? Thank you, Kiko. Great to be here.

4263," you The Biden administration has set out to deploy more than half a million EV charging stations by the end of this decade. It's part of a larger ambition to slash the number of all gas powered cars in the U.S. by half by 2030. Making that transition equitable, though, could be a challenge with a majority of charging stations deployed in predominantly white neighborhoods. Our next guest is trying to change that through a unique incubator in Los Angeles. Let's bring in Matt Peterson. He is the CEO of LA Clean Tech Incubator. The segment presented by BMW Matt. Good to talk to you again. It's interesting in preparing for this, I was looking at a map of where all the charging stations are right now. It's really glaring to see how concentrated they are in predominantly wealthy white neighborhoods. Can you talk about what the landscape looks like in LA where we have seen significant transition to EVs? Yeah, we'll great to see you, Kiko. Thanks for having me on. When we look at new markets and emerging markets, obviously the signals from policymakers in California really put the investment into electric vehicles and the charging infrastructure that makes it possible. Now, what that means is that the early adopters have predominantly been on what we call the west side of Los Angeles in our case, which is predominantly white. And what we are doing as an organization through our transportation electrification partnership, is seeing how we can accelerate investment into low income disadvantaged communities, meaning those communities that have socioeconomic challenges, disinvestment, ruglining, historical and institutional barriers to really get access to the services they need, whether it's adequate transit or transportation, let alone electric vehicles. So by doing pilots and advocating for policies like we successfully advocated for a statewide zero missions vehicle advocate for disadvantaged communities or equity advocates, we called it. Now the governor is going to point that person for California to help address some of these inequities. But in the meantime, we're working on putting a charging and EV car sharing into places like public housing where we know populations, people that live there don't have access to adequate transportation, suffer from worse air quality and really can benefit from these kinds of solutions right there available exclusively for them. Now, can you talk a bit more about the structure of Lacey? I mean, it's interesting to see how you're sort of playing this from both sides. You're obviously investing in some of these startups that are addressing those very issues you talked about, but you're also deploying these charging stations into more low income communities and exposing them to them so that there's not as big of a divide in terms of going from a gas powered car to an EV. Yeah. I think we're helping entrepreneurs in one end, particularly Black Brown and female entrepreneurs who have a tougher time getting access to capital. So how do we provide them additional resources and support to get access to capital, including from our own venture fund and, excuse me, debt fund that we provide, they'll cost financing to them for capital access and work in capital. But at the same time, how do we work with local governments and city officials to bring the charging work needs to go? So our utility partners like Edison and LLEDVP are making programs available to invest in chargers and lower income neighborhoods, but how do we still write that? So we're doing a pilot in the community under those signs and gardens that's going to be a fast charger at the street near multi-family buildings, a predominantly low income neighborhood, so that we can then educate people about electric vehicles, make public charging available to them and demonstrate where it is. And how do we also target people that drive Uber and Lyft? How do we get TNC drivers behind the wheel of an EV? And that kind of public fast charging is going to be critical.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,42,2022-10-27 16:43:43
4264," Okay, where it is. And how do we also target people that drive Uber and Lyft? How do we get TNC drivers behind the wheel of an EV? And that kind of public fast charging is gonna be critical. While we then work to get level two charging, the slower charging inside of the multifamily building, apartment building. So as people can take advantage of the used EV tax credit and the inflation reduction act to buy more affordable EVs, that they have a place to charge. Finally, Matt, California has kind of been on the front lines of this transition to go all electric. You've been working very closely with the mayor, Garcetti there on the ground in shaping LA's policy. Now that you see where the federal government in this administration is trying to take it. I wonder if there are any lessons learned from California slash LA's transition. If you think there is a glaring missing piece when you look at federal policy to address this issue. Well, not every state has a utility pursuing aggressive targets based on public policy or their own utilities commitment to the market for electric vehicles and the charging needed. Not every state has the rebates and additional incentives that California has. So how does the federal government go and provide support directly to cities as much as they can? So through the competitive grant program through the bipartisan infrastructure package, some cities will be able to access those dollars for charging directly. There's state energy offices may not be as interesting in deploying those charging stations with funding from federal government equitably into lower income neighborhoods so that people can access the benefits of electric vehicles by having the charging infrastructure in their backyard. The other thing is making sure that those chargers are working. So if you drive an ED sometimes you may experience such a charger that doesn't work and 80% of the time that it does not, it's a non-electrical issue. It means that the Wi-Fi connections down something like a software issue. So we have a company that we've been committed called Charger Help that's out there making sure we have uptime. So the federal government can make sure those that benefit from the federal government dollars make sure those chargers are working 95% of the time and that there's a company like Charger Help making sure those chargers are working, diagnose them, fix them, keep them up and maintained. Yeah, it's certainly been great to watch the progress of everything you've done over at Lacey. Matt, good to talk to you today. Matt Peterson, CEO of Lacey. The company is taking an earnings hit in the third quarter. The company reporting $9.3 million loss but some light ahead. COVID travel restrictions out of Japan are easing. A Hawaiian Airlines CEO Peter Ingram says, this sets the stage for a full restoration of the airlines network and the coming months, the best dress CEO in the business, joining us now, always good to see you sir. joining us now always good to see you sir. Strong earnings from American and United and Delta had expectations up over the biggest headwinds for you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,43,2022-10-27 16:48:30
4265," Business joining us now always good to see you sir. Strong earnings from American and United and Delta had expectations up. What were the biggest headwinds for you? Well, we really did see some mixed signs across our business. We've had a very strong recovery in our North America to Hawaii markets, which is the biggest part of our revenue generation. Really, you know, there's no question that's been back for several quarters. Holding things back a little bit is our two parts of our network. One is neighbor island where demand is actually strong, but we've got a competitive situation with low fares in that part of the network that are suppressing financial returns. And then Japan in the third quarter wasn't fully recovered is going to take a little time to get back. The good news is that at the beginning of October, they have removed some of the pandemic travel restrictions in Japan. And so the environment is really set up now to have a more robust recovery over the next couple of quarters. And Japan is the biggest source of international visitors to Hawaii. It's very important to the market and important to us. Peter, you touched on the competition there from a local competitor aggressive pricing. I know you also talked about this on the earnings call last night. What are you doing then to compete because they are offering fares at very, very low prices? Well, we're matching the fares on many of our flights. So we've got pretty broad availability of those discounted fares. But on top of that, we offer a broader and deeper schedule. We really want to focus on delivering impeccable service to our guests. We've doubled our Hawaiian miles that we offer to our guests, reward our loyal passengers. So we're going to make sure that we give people reason to fly Hawaiian. Whatever the fare price environment is, we want to make sure that when people have a choice, they choose Hawaiian as they have for 93 years traveling between the islands. So we're no stranger to competition. And we're just going to face it head on. 39 dollar fares. That's a burger and a beer in New York City these days. The deal with Amazon, how significant an investor story is that? And can you tell us more about the option to acquire up to 15% of your stock? We're really excited to be able to announce us agreeing with Amazon. It's been in the works for a number of months and it's great to be able to talk about it now. It really means a couple of things fundamentally for us going forward. One is that it's an avenue for growth in the years ahead. And so it really opens up a new channel for us to grow the business in a little bit of a different way. And it also helps us diversify our business. You know, this business with Amazon won't be facing the same risks and challenges that we have in the passenger business. That doesn't mean it's risk free, but it is a little bit of diversification, which is good when you're dealing with, you know, the ups and downs of an economic cycle. So we're contracted now to fly 10 airplanes for on behalf of Amazon. We'll be flying between airports that are near their large distribution centers. Most of this will be on the U.S. mainland. Some of it is likely to touch Hawaii over time. And there's an opportunity to grow beyond that. And it's up to us to to perform and deliver impeccable service and to operate on time. So Amazon chooses to in, you know, pickups to do more of their flying going forward. And JPM, JP Morgan calling it a game changer here for your business. Peter, when you take a look at staffing, and I know we've talked with you about it in the past, the pilot shortages, what you're doing, what that currently looks like for your business. Have you seen any improvement? We've really seen some good traction being gained here in terms of being able to to staff up. We've been hiring pilots and flight attendants and other employees throughout the year. In terms of pilots right now, we're able to recruit the pilots we need. And part of that is because.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,44,2022-10-27 16:52:26
4266," throughout the year. In terms of pilots right now, we're able to recruit the pilots we need. And part of that is because we've got a lot of wide-body aircraft and wide-body aircraft are at the end of the day what pilots get paid the most to fly. So we've got a pretty compelling economic proposition. We've improved a lot in terms of being able to recruit mechanics and airport employees here in Hawaii. That's been a tight market, but we're moving along. And over the course of the whole year, we're up to close to 1,500 positions filled. And that's at a company where our total employment is about 7,200 right now. So a lot of activity from our recruiting department and they're doing a good job, but it is a dynamic market. And you've got to make sure you've got a compelling proposition and that you've got a company that people want to work for. And that's something we're really focused on making sure that we're an employer that is a desired destination in a competitive market. Peter Ingram, always great to have you. Thanks so much for coming on after earnings. We hope you join us again in next quarter. Peter Ingram, CEO of Hawaiian Holdings. Thank you. So you can look at the broader market here because the S&P back in the red today's big tech sells off. Microsoft and Google leading it to the downside following their disappointing earnings results. You see the S&P off just around a 7, 10% of a percent NASAC actually up nearly 2% this afternoon. You hear to talk about that and some of the broader trends. At play, we want to bring in Tom Lydon, vetifies, Smyshe Chairman. He joins us for this week's ETF report sponsored by Invesco. QQQ, Tom, it's great to see you. The slide that we're seeing in tech, I know you recently just wrote about ETF fund flows when it comes to some of those tech specific funds. What do you make of today's news and what do you think that's going to mean for investor appetite there? So when you look at the big picture coming out of the financial crisis, it was all about fang stocks, Microsoft, those tech stocks that really drove the S&P to it was really tough to beat. No active managers could really touch it. Now in the last couple of years, S&P's been challenged and we're seeing more of that with these mega cap stocks being challenged in the market. What that does mean to is it's better for some of these actively managed ETFs. For the first time in 20 years, we're seeing active managers actually outperform some of their index counter parts that they're benchmark against. So that's good for the ETF business because active management.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,45,2022-10-27 16:56:53
4267," of managers actually outperform some of their index counter parts that they're benchmark against. So that's good for the ETF business because Active Management is really made it in there. Number two, there are also great opportunities outside the mega-cap area, outside the S&P 500 small caps in the last three months are up, almost 8% compared to the S&P that's only up 3%. So diversifying away from these big companies is important and also when you look at small caps just because of the strong dollar, multinationals are affected overseas, we know that, but there's a home country bias with small caps where they can buy goods and services overseas and do most of their business in the US. And then finally, quick shout out to stocks overseas. I mean, listen, those markets are challenged and in many cases in emerging markets, you've got multi-generational buying opportunities where there are single digit peas there and although it doesn't feel good, the currencies is working against you. If you've got a long-term outlook like you guys do, you could buy some now and just forget about it for a couple years, but you're not going to see buying opportunities with these low PE ratios that you see now. Speaking of overseas challenges that could, to some, represent opportunities. These third term and China hammered Chinese big tech stocks, Chinese stocks represented here is their opportunities there in the ETF space. Well, Peter Lynch said don't ever let a bear market opportunity go unused or something like that. I'm kind of paraphrasing that, but it not only from a technical standpoint, a governmental standpoint, all the saber rattling that's going on and then the whole delisting thing that's happening, that's really key and important. But we have to know that timeline is not the next three months, it's actually the next two years. So we've got some time for that delisting thing and the accounting thing to be worked out. And also with that being said, you look at some of these companies like Baba, they're not going away and they're going to continue with all the online buying that's happening and going to continue to grow the fact that most of the citizens in China don't have laptops, they don't have laptops, they do everything off of their phone and all their buying and purchasing happens there. There are companies that are set up there to take full advantage of that and the valuations have come down tremendously where you could buy some of these ETFs like K-Web which is online buying China which has just been devastated, price wise, but the crazy thing is shareholders are staying tough, they're not selling. Actually some are doubling down because they see this as a buying opportunity. Time you mentioned the strong dollar, obviously a huge headwind, we've heard about it from a number of CEOs who have reported earnings over the last couple of weeks, we've seen the dollar index pull back just a bit today but when you see the strength of the dollar here, what do you think that means from an investment standpoint and then if you're looking to capitalize on this through ETFs, what should people be doing? Well as Katie said in the last segment, it's tough to find a trend. When you fight a trend, you've got to have some pretty big guts right now with all the uncertainty in the marketplace, people are going towards safe havens, the dollars are safe haven for sure. We continue to see rising rates, Fed's pretty clear about signaling which is a good thing. They're telling what's going to happen and since they were pretty clear about that in May, all of a sudden there's been more confidence in the market. Let me see from the advisors that were surveying regularly when they were selling bonds have now actually come back into the bond market because there's more clarity along with these advanced yields so that's really, really good. What we can't count on is stability overseas and that's the scary thing. But while there is an instability ETFs like UUP which in the Ovesco Long Dollar, there's an opportunity that if you want to hedge against continued problems overseas with foreign currencies and instability in governments, that may continue to do well. That applies Tom Liden, I was good to see you sir. Thanks for being here. Good to see you, D. Good to see you, D. You're on it.

4268," In this episode of Influencers, Quarkron Group founder, Barbara Quarkron. Well, I see the business as an extension of the person who runs it. Short and simple, I see it on Shark Tank. So much money invested in things that make absolutely no sense. I get so much satisfaction out of helping my businesses that I've invested in. Not because I'm making money over that helps a lot, I find after a few years. But I love seeing someone with a dream and thinking I'm part of getting into that dream. Hello everyone and welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Sirward and welcome to our guest Barbara Quarkron founder, the Quarkron Group host of the podcast, unusual business and shark and executive producer on ABC's Shark Tank. Barbara, welcome. Great to see you. Pleasure to be here with you. Thanks. So, want to ask you a little bit about this economic environment. Conflation seems to be roaring back and I'm wondering if people should really take this into account right now, an individual or a couple who are looking to make a big purchase or should you try to time it and wait it out. You should move faster because houses are only getting more expensive. It's harder to get your hands on something that you even find acceptable to live with, never mind something you've been dreaming about. Interest rates are still low, although they've been creeping up and they have promised to continue to go up. And so there's nothing to be gained by waiting whatsoever, absolutely nothing. So if you weren't smart enough to get into the market two years ago or a year ago, the idea right now is get into it as fast as you can if you really want to home and beyond the home front, I think it's probably the best market I have ever seen for real estate investing. I think the return on investment is phenomenal and has been in so many markets and so many cities throughout the US that it's only I don't want to say it can't go wrong, but it's probably the best market I've ever seen in my life. So I think real estate is a champion, I'm not saying that because that's my gig because I invest in a lot of stuff, but I'm saying it because I've never seen it more tantalizing and with more promise. You want to pick up on that last point, which is real estate is an investment, not your home per se, but I guess you're talking about like a rental property or something like that. A property or a building with five or six units, a 20 units, the numbers there, the returns people are getting are really surprising. And why is that exactly so in other words, because they're such demand and then rates are still low enough to make your cost of capital still pretty good? A few reasons. One that was a shyness in the market, people were slow to respond to investment real estate. Now everybody's jumping into it, but it kind of lag behind all of the kinds of investments. So you had a little rest period. Secondly, the rents have been going up nationally and if you choose your properties carefully, like if you're investing, say in Orlando, rents are up almost 30%, crazy. So picture what that does to the bottom line. And very importantly, which we all take for granted, like our right to breathe, money so cheap. And so you could leverage really high. So even in New York City, which has gone through a really tough period because of all the changes, Albany that make it really almost untenable to make money here as an investor. A lot of people have stopped buying, they've moved them money elsewhere. And there's so many opportunities to buy and get very good returns because rents keep going up. Yeah, I want to drill down in some of those specific markets, Barbara. You mentioned Orlando is hot. New York is problematic. What are some other areas that are either hot or cold or things are catching your eye? Well, I should have a chart in front of me because I keep a chart and I can't remember what order they are. But you have a Houston is a very vibrant market in rentals and prices on investment real estate is still not catching up to it from what I could see. You see Pittsburgh is mind boggling. Pittsburgh is probably where I've really put more of my money in the last two years and anywhere else. And the reason for it is people didn't take it seriously. It's not considered a major.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,47,2022-10-27 17:05:27
4269," Pittsburgh is probably where I've really put more of my money in the last two years and anywhere else. And the reason for it is because people didn't take it seriously. It's not considered a major city. But there's been so much technology that has moved in there. It's got the most educated populations. It's got a friendly government that loves development. They have no rent restrictions or rent control. So it's almost like a cowboy land. You could really gallop out of the gate and make money right from the get-go. And that's exactly what I'm happy, I shouldn't say it because I don't want any competition. But now everybody is discovering it. But the minor cities pretty much with I don't forget which city just announced rent control. Boy, I backed out of that so fast. But most of the secondary cities are doing very well. You almost get a dark board. Throw the dart there, be okay. It's Bernie, you got the Steelers too. What about New York City, though, Barbara? I mean, we're talking about an extreme luxury market. What are the dynamics going on in here in the big apple? I am telling you that super duper luxury market has totally changed, particularly over the last three months. If you're a really wealthy person, you want to make a statement and get a trophy property. You'll be competing with a bunch of other giant egos with a fatter wall at the new have. The super luxury market is suddenly a shortage of listings. I never thought a year ago, I would say that. But there's overbidding on new development sites. On the upper side, there's one building that's going as a starting point 20% over-ass from the day it opened the door two months ago. It makes no sense. It was overpriced to be with and now it's going 20% over-ass to developers celebrating. The luxury market, I can imagine it's stopping and the new development, although I see cranes all over town, just can't keep up with the demand. That's crazy, sir. The top end. That's the top end. You don't know. What about the middle on everything else? Well, the middle in New York today is get a three to five million dollar apartment in middle class, right? The middle market is a shortage of listings. If you're in a co-op, they don't sell nearly as well as if you have a condominium, just because it's such a preference for the condo product over the co-op, particularly in the last two years. Don't really why that's changed. If you're looking for a small piet of tear for your kid that's going to NYU, forget about it. You might as well just keep them at home and lock them up. It's just too damn expensive. Real surprises of those units are going up like 20%. If you want to rent something, I know I own a lot of rental billings in New York where I have a lot of those type of rich kids, the parents guarantee the least, which makes you feel really cozy at night. But those rents, I mean, it's a bidding war in every single apartment no matter how high you price it when it comes to market. And just Hudson Yars doing okay? That thing's getting out filled up now? It's working on it. Don't ask me about Hudson Yars because I don't want to do the money damage, but it's not my cup of tea, so to speak. Okay. It's a big project over there. Let's just leave it there. A big project over there. Yes. Exactly. And what about the future against sort of broadening out nationally, Barbara? And what's in store? I mean, is it so just completely rate dependent? It's rate helped. If interest rates, I forget how much they've gone up in the since December, like what is it? Three quarters of a point are thereabouts, I think. It's it's helped by rate. Okay. It's helped by cheap rates. If the rates go up by one point, you buy less house. You have to cut your budget down a bit while rent prices, pardon me, while house prices are skyrocketing at the same time. So it eliminates more buyers, but I'm not afraid of that. I almost hate to wish it, but it's almost like we need it. We need to comment down, cool it off. But if rates go up by 2%, well, the bottom fall out of the market, well, houses not sell no because it's such a shortage. But does it make fewer buyers compete for those houses most definitely? And so rates rates are always in partnership with real estate. I mean, that's like the foundation of real estate. Can I borrow the money cheap? It doesn't sound like you're that scared of Jay Powell, right? No, I'm not so I'm not so scared. All right, shifting gears a little bit, crypto, Bitcoin. I think you said it would be perfect for real estate transactions. Why do you think that is? And you really think that could be a routine way for people to pay for real estate?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,48,2022-10-27 17:09:50
4270," I think you said it would be perfect for real estate transactions. Why do you think that is? And you really think that could be a routine way for people to pay for real estate? You know, there's a lot of money passed under the table on high-end real estate that people don't know about. You know, what you see as a sales record is sometimes not very, sometimes just not really what really, really transacted. And that's very clumsy to do and difficult to do. I know cryptocurrencies because of the nature of what they are, people would feel comfortable. It would help high-end real estate particularly. So I think I don't see why not. It's efficient. People believe in it. People are trusting it. And I just don't see why that wouldn't become not the norm by any means for the average person. But a big piece of the real estate market. Yeah, I do. You guys seen any of that yet actually in your business? We have seen three apartments trade that I know of. Is this probably much more than I know. We've seen three apartments trade in the last two years with cryptocurrency. Well, all right. It's coming. Okay. And then how about even beyond that part? I'm talking about the metaverse. Okay. And real estate. Okay. So I think you said on Yahoo Finance last month that the real estate deals in a metaverse have high-pap reality, but it could be an opportunity. What do you think the likelihood that a metaverse real estate investment would pay off down the line? I think, and you know, this is a little guesswork. Even people who claim they know what they do, I don't believe everybody is just guessing. But if you want to add my guesses to the pile, I think the greatest potential in the real estate space in the metaverse certainly is retail and commercial. So retail because it's being halfway done already that some of these high price brands like Gucci, Leviton are selling virtual clothing as an FTs. And there's a large appetite for it. They're buying. So of course, we need the bridge between the actual clothing that I could see with when I go to the little wall I could hold a purse in my hand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,49,2022-10-27 17:14:19
4271," So of course, we need the bridge between the actual clothing that I could see with when I go to the little, the little mall I could hold a person my hand I could buy it actually ordered that's not far away. So assuming that really happens that marries and I don't see why it wouldn't really. I think retail could be the best thing that ever that metavers could be the best thing that ever happened to retail. I must say so. I also think that the ability to meet with the people that work with you or people who ability to meet with anyone in the metaverse makes the commercial sector very juicy. I really believe that people will do more of business in the metaverse in terms of meeting up. And so that makes commercial space very valuable. I think the question has to be answered is what makes one space more valuable than the other and why would I pay that and not that. And that's I think that's going to all come out in the wash over the next couple of years. Certainly I know it's a odd example, but with Snoop Dogg offering parcels right next to our house. I took that very seriously because suddenly there was a differentiation between one lot and another that someone was willing to pay so much to be next to celebrity. Now with the celebrity they're going to do concerts and entertainment that's a natural for the metaverse. So you might say well that's not true of all real estate, but there's a proof of concept that people will bid high and pay a lot of money to be near something else. And that's what real estate is like in our universe. So I see that as filled with potential that one example. I don't put much credence in the fact that Morgan guaranteed now has what do they have the lounge thing. I just see that as extension of their their chimneys. The ego there because you get to see a real live tiger when you walk through his face and then you see a great portrait of the head of the bank. Wow, I really want to buy next to that. Okay, but that's just I think that's just stealing the headlines that good PR stunt, you know, but I do pay attention to Snoop Dogg most seriously because that is proof of concept. Any big regrets from Shark Tank investing regrets that is. Yeah, I regret the first two years I invested in Shark Tank because I was trying to figure out which businesses were good in businesses that I had no knowledge of I know real estate. That's it. But I was trying to figure out this is a good business. When I finally threw that away on year three, I started making the right choices by just focusing on the entrepreneur. It made it also simple so I wasted two good years and trying to be who I wasn't I wasted those two years feeling insecure. The second guessing myself, it wasn't any fun. It's only when you're comfortable in your space and you trust in yourself, do you start to have fun. So yeah, I'd rewind and get rid of those first two years away. I was managing them. Hey, do you ever invest in the stock market and equities and if so or maybe even not if so, what do you like? What do you not like what do you think about? I do not and let me tell you why I don't because I like to know what I'm doing. I love control. I invest in real estate. I could smell it. I could feel that I know what I'm doing and I make money. Now, any financial advisor that I've ever talked to said it's not wise to have all my equity in real estate real estate of this kind that kind. I listen and I'm sure they're right in theory, but in actuality. They're not right for me. I'm right for me. I know how to do that well and so I stick with my knitting. Let me ask you about celebrity CEOs and well, Barbara, you might kind of be one, but I'm really talking about. Well, I'm talking about you. I guess a little bit, but Elon Musk and his tweeting and Warren Buffett and Zuckerberg are celebrity CEOs good for business and what can be learned from from different models of being a high profile person like that. Depends who you're talking about now, doesn't it? Elon, you mentioned him. He doesn't want people to pay as much attention to his tweets and what's he tweeting for? Of course he does. His personal tweets control the value of his business, his personal demeanor and the way he looks and acts and says kind of a little bit of a wild man, right? People love him. People love him. If you could get your audience to love you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,50,2022-10-27 17:18:28
4272," and the way he looks and acts and says, kind of a little bit of a wild man, right? People love him. People love him. If you could get your audience to love you, you stocked those better. So simple as that. What a great high profile CEO does for a firm is they A, get attention, which is very important, especially when the business is young. And B, they get the right attention if it's a love affair. And people will buy with their heart and justify with their head in that order. I believe in anything. I've learned that my years in business. So people will buy into him and they'll justify that that stock is going to be amazing. And guess what? They're right because of enough people feel that way the stock keeps rising. Take a Mark Zuckerberg by comparison, okay? Mark Zuckerberg, I always pronounce his name wrong. Mark Zuckerberg, somebody's got to tell me how to pronounce his name. Dr. Berg, give it to me again. My office says this all day long. What is it? Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg. Yeah, Zuckerberg. Didn't you hear that? What I just said. Okay, he's smart. And people respond to him like, wow, he was young, so smart, so rich. But unfortunately, he's also sneaky and robotic. And so people don't trust him. Well, like him, isn't that said? I don't know if he's trustworthy. I don't know. I don't know a thing about that piece of him, but I can tell you something. Does that work against his value for his business? Yes, it does. It really does because it's not like a ball. All right, take somebody like Jeff Bezos. You know what I thought? When I saw that he lost all that weight and must have had a great personal trainer looking buff and got him to sell the young wife, I thought to myself, good for his stock. Maybe not, but he looks like a guy who looks like a winner when I see him in the pages of the papers. You see, so I don't think you can underestimate the power that a celebrity head can bring to a firm or the damage it could do when it's the wrong messaging. But I think today it's almost essential. I don't think it's an extra. You know, there was a time when we didn't elect celebrities for the highest office in our country, but we have found recently that that's a pretty darn good calling card, you know, same with business. I think things have changed. It's all about marketing branding and who puts a face on a brand better than the face. Right. It's essential. I want to ask you a little bit about, well, I guess maybe inequality in our economy and whether or not the debt is stacked increasingly against a little guy in terms of people wanting to start businesses. Tech is so big. Rich people are getting richer. Is it that much harder now, Barbara, for someone to start a small business? I don't believe it's harder for someone to start a small business, harder to maybe to get the hands on the money, but that's always been hard. And the great majority, the small business started in America. Don't borrow money. They work it off, so to speak. Like I did like so many small businesses did. But is there an inequality, which is your larger question across the world? Of course there is. I've never seen a less balanced America than we're seeing right now. Does a little guy have the same shot they had 10 years ago for anything? No. I mean, do they even have the same shot versus a year ago? No, with inflation doing what it's doing. They get a 3% raise and then inflation goes up 5% so that money buys less to feed their family. I mean, they re- the lower price the worker in America, the shorter into the stick and the shorter the stick gets. I re-end for the wealthier people in America. Everybody, I know seems to be making money. I mean, everyone I know who owns businesses through COVID made more money. I really mean it. I have many very well healed friends and they were complaining all the way to the bank. But that's not true of the people, the moms that were staying at home, mining their kids and gave up the second income because the kids couldn't go to school. There is such a breach between the rich and the poor in America. It frightens me. I think about it a lot. I should have a solution. I do not at all. But I think about it a lot. I think it's very troubling. Yes. I was going to ask you if you had any ideas. I mean, one thing is obviously higher taxes and everyone's all up in arms about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,51,2022-10-27 17:22:48
4273," I think it's very troubling, yes. Yeah, I was going to ask you if you had any ideas. I mean, one thing is obviously higher taxes and everyone's all up in arms about that. But it is a difficult problem to solve, right? If it wasn't, it would have been solved a while ago. Certainly, people are concerned about it. I've talked about it a heck of a long time. As long as I can remember talking myself, it's a difficult problem to solve. Yeah. You have a lot of questions. Let me ask you a little bit about you, Barbara. You grew up in New Jersey. I think you were the second oldest in a family of 10 siblings, is that right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's a good position, actually, in a family. Oh, well, I'm talking about that. You talked about the competition for attention from your parents. How do you think that experience formed you? Oh, totally formed me. In my family, most of the kids are all entrepreneurs. They are entrepreneurs for one reason. My father was a working man, worked two jobs his whole life, and came home and told us how much he hated his boss. And quit and got fired and quit and got fired. We all grew up not consciously thinking we want to be in charge of ourselves, but we are. That was very important. In terms of getting attention, I'm very good at marketing. That comes from being one of 10. I know it. I had to learn how to speak up, interrupt, and be faster on my feet than the other nine if I was to get my mother's attention, because it was spread among 10 kids, oh, my dad's attention. So when you're in a big family, you know, how to get attention, you will somehow how to compete. But the greatest thing, and I'm not stereotyping about all large families, but large families that are led by loving, powerful parents for those kids. They're the luckiest kids in the world, because you know what it's like really? It's like growing up in a small town. It doesn't feel like a family. Everybody's got a role. Everybody has a gift. Everybody's demonstrating their gift. You don't get a free ride. You're not helped out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,52,2022-10-27 17:27:13
4274," town. It doesn't feel like a family. Everybody's got a role. Everybody has a gift. Everybody's demonstrating their gift. You don't get a free ride. You're not helped out, but along the way you get the confidence that you're fine and will do well in life. So we all walked out of that household 18. None of us were worried about doing well for ourselves. It was embedded in our DNA by our clients who believed we could. And we were well equipped with the various traits we had developed. Being in that large family with no money to go around and helping out, we all had jobs. I had 22 jobs before I started my real estate business. All of us worked from the time we were 11, part time jobs, babysitting, you know, at the kitty pool, whatever we could get our hands on because we contributed to the household. So we were well equipped for living in a way. And you began the real estate career. 20s, you sold it I think for what? 66 million in 2001. What was the key to building that business, Barbara? Talent. Talent choosing the right people because you have to remember when you have any young business don't want to work for you. And you don't have the means to buy people. You have to hustle somehow to get some willing souls to come work for you. And so hiring the right people and then the second part is developing their loyalty. So they love you. And that's easy for me. You just love them really hard and they love you back. It's automatic. That's how you build a business. I mean, that was really my great talent is the right people and knowing how to build a team for sure and getting them so that they would like jump off a cliff for me. And they would because I would have jumped off a cliff for them. And so it was a mutual love affair. That's what built the coming. And later years I was able to build the coming much faster because I realized I had a gift for marketing. I could make something small look very big and get everybody to write about it. That's a bullshit factor that you learn in a large family going back to that because you have to be very entertaining and get attention. But those are really the only two gifts I had. But I was able to choose all the right people around me that had all the other many things that I needed to build a big business. And I always had the right people. And finally Barbara, I mean, today you co-host the TV show, podcast speeches, you get some endorsements, you have all manner of projects. What is it that you consider important right now in your life and then even looking ahead your legacy going forward? Well, I don't care about legacies because I'll be dead. So what do I care about? But so far as what's important, I think of pretty much what winds up being important all of us. I just really want to make a difference. However, I do it. I feel like I make a difference talking to the individual people that call on an 888 Barbara. I think I'm really good at giving advice because I can size up the situation the person and give them the right advice. And so I do very well with my business unusual podcast, simply because people recognize it as valuable. And I feel really, really good about it. I get so much satisfaction out of helping my businesses that I've invested in, not because I'm making money, although that helps a lot I find after a few years. But I love seeing someone with a dream and thinking I'm part of getting into that dream. It's like being very Godmother. How many people get to play that life, right? And so that is again another form of helping someone. You know, so anything that I feel like I helped someone, I seem to make money right away. And I seem to get a lot of love back. So I feel very fulfilled and not empty handed as I get older and older close to that great. All right, that is the one and only Barbara Corcoran. Barbara, thank you so much for your time. My pleasure. I sang it out with you. You've been watching Influencers. I'm Andy Sherwer. We'll see you next time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,53,2022-10-27 17:31:22
4275," Hahaha... Welcome back to Y'all Finance. I'm Brian Saazzy. Alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Lots coming at investors today. Pretty lame outlook from Meta, but a good quarter from Caterpillar, GDP. GDP came in pretty good at about 2.6%. Right now you're seeing the Dow, solidly in the green, the S&P 500 NASDAQ in the red, of course, weighed down by that Meta report. But let's get over to Julie Hyman, some breaking news and all things mortgage rates. Yeah, mortgage rates were learning last week, averaging 7.08%. So breaking the 7% barrier here, this is according to Freddie Mac. Again, 30 year fixed rate mortgage above 7% for the first time going back to April 2002. So it has been more than 20 years since we have seen a mortgage rate at these levels. We have seen already the ripple effect through the housing market yesterday. New home sales were reportedly down 10.9% month over month, although that was actually not as big a drop as estimated, but it is having an effect on pricing across the nation, on affordability across the nation and on the pace of home sales. So again, 7.08% is where that 30 year fixed rate mortgage on average now stands. Brad, 33 minutes into today's trading session. Let's take a look at the major averages to see where things have started to move around just a little bit. The Dow Jones industrial average still up by about 300 points right now. 1% higher. We're off of today's session highs, but still holding on to the green. The NASDAQ composite, we've seen some way on tech right now. And we'll get into that in a hot second when we go over to the heat map. But as of right now, the NASDAQ composite, you're seeing that down by a little more than 1.1%, 125 points, triple digit decline day for the NASDAQ thus far. The S&P 500, that also being dragged a little bit by tech right now, you're seeing that down by about 2.10% of a percent. And so going over to some of the heat maps very quickly here, taking a look first at the sectors that we're seeing. And yeah, you mentioned it, well, I mentioned it actually. It's down by about 6% of percent of its technology here, going to Super Meta here on myself. And since I mentioned Meta, let's go over to the NASDAQ and take a look at those major cap, mega cap tech stocks as well. And you're seeing some of the declines across the board, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon. And then, yeah, additionally Meta, look at this down, 22%. We're touching levels we haven't seen since February 2016. Also, everyone's straight.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,54,2022-10-27 17:36:06
4276," Yeah, additionally meta. Look at this down 22%. We're touching levels we haven't seen since February 2016. Also, everyone, strengthen the banking sector here. It's continuing with Raymond James, reporting a beat in revenue and estimates banks and finance have recently seen a boost from higher interest rates, but Raymond James is also taking careful note of what it calls a challenging and volatile market environment. Joining us now to talk about earnings and the sector. We've got Paul Riley, Raymond James, CEO, in a first on Yahoo interview. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, as we were breaking down some of the earnings that have just come across, and largely the season that we've been navigating through, if there's kind of a common denominator or a set of them that you've been taking away from this, what are they from your perspective? Well, first, great to be here, and it's always good to be on the show. There's just a lot of uncertainty, and I think this is the great thing in our business as people need their financial advisor more than ever. You have uncertain equity markets. All you have to do is listen to four or five speakers with different views, so it's not certain where we're going. The Fed clearly has said they're going to continue to raise interest rates and inflation numbers high. The GDP number was actually good today, but again, that shows the economy is going. So it's, you know, you have to pick stocks. You have to pick your choices because it's a very uncertain market. And frankly, in the last almost decade, as long as you were in, you did pretty well. And that's not the case today. So, and investors are, you know, their individuals are in different situations. Some are still longer term, and they can take the downs with the ups, some can't afford the risk, and now fixed income is giving them a chance to invest in. And most people are in between. How do I balance the long term bets and equities against inflation versus making sure I have income? And, you know, so it's complicated environment, but it's a chance to really, you know, show your value also. Paul, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. If people are coming to you because they're concerned about the environment, and they want advice as they seem to be, what is happening in terms of their willingness to pay for it? I did see asset management fees were down 6%, collectively. But I wonder what's happening on an individualized basis. Have you been, I mean, we've been talking everybody about raising prices. Are you all raising your fees? Well, you look at, you know, the, with us, the advisor really has the primary client relationship and the fee pricing is really set with them, with our oversight, but to the what they're doing for their client. And what we've seen is most advisors aggressively managing fees in terms of what funds they go in, what and how they're managing, what the cost is to the investor, but to the incline, but surprisingly, I mean, those fees with the advisor have held up extremely well. And I just shows the value. The value isn't just investing. It's psychology, you know, so many people wanted to get out of the market pre-COVID. They would have lost a huge opportunity where they can look at the down in the last few months and say, well, look at my down, and they could remind, look, this is your, you're on plan. This is your plan for your life. You were up, you know, more than you thought, you're down a little bit now, but you're still on plan, stay invested. So you don't get hurt. And that value, in almost a family psychologist, in many cases, has shown that people are still willing to pay the fees and the fee to the advisor themselves has been under surprisingly a lot less pressure than the overall cost for us to produce, you know, more effectively. Paul, a lot of your peers in the industry are now looking at a lot of belt tightening as the industry has slowed. What are you doing inside of Raymond James? Well, we're trying to be very thoughtful. So first, we have comp pressure as the whole industry of seeing, we start talking about it a year ago when, you know, before people did it, and we're going to treat our people well, both with our record results this year and quarter, but also because that's the, you know, the market today. And we have to make sure we keep people. We can only belt tighten so much. We're still growing. We're growing across all of our businesses. And, you know, so we're still recruiting and hiring people. So the focus is where do you spend smartly? And where do you stay focused? Like, for example, our tech spend is going up. Our technology for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,55,2022-10-27 17:40:12
4277," people. So the focus is where do you spend smartly and where do you stay focused? Like for example, our tech spend is going up. Our technology for which we believe is leading edge industry leading for our advisors on in terms of wealth planning, you know, we can't let that slip because that's what's driven our, you know, continued top of the industry recruiting and retention. And now the apps to the individual, you know, clients, again, we got again, that's there because that's part of the market. So in other areas in the back office, we pride ourselves in top level service. And we have to push to be more cost efficient and what technologies and processes can we use to keep those costs in check. So we're still in growth mode. We're cautious on the economy. The great thing about the company, well before I got here, it's always been long term focused. We've been criticized maybe over the last few years of having too much capital and liquidity. We aren't right now. And you know, so in bull markets, maybe we look like we're, you know, being too conservative, but we plan for these kind of markets. And that's it's showing up in our growth. And we still have plenty of balance sheet flexibility to operate even if we do have a hard landing. When you think about the absence of easy money policies and what that means for some of the more speculative assets that even the wealthiest clients that you may deal with would be prone to perhaps nibble at in the past, wherever you've seen that strategy start to wane and perhaps shift into some of the other spaces. And what types of recommendations are you are you providing them? Well, you'll still see that as kind of, you know, cyclical. So certainly when rates move quickly like they have. So if you go to the bond market, certainly the non-rated bonds and things get hit first and get hit hardest. But at some point at that price adjustment, that's when, you know, the very wealthy or hedge funds or investment funds see the opportunity in the best. So it's really calling when that happens. So you have to look through the whole cycle and look at the opportunities for those clients. Now a lot of clients don't have that extra network. So you got to keep them down the middle. But others that do have that ability, you know, it's kind of a wait and see and strike when they see the opportunity. Now if you believe there's going to be a hard landing, that means there's going to be a lot more opportunity and you keep powder dry. If you think this is going to be a softer one and you're going to get a pickup, then, you know, you can be a little more aggressive now. And we see clients on all sides of that right now. So it's, again, not an easy call to say, where are we going to be six months from now? But from a company standpoint, you know, with our flexible balance sheet, we didn't lock in rates with a lot of our competitors did. And we're seeing the benefit of that now. And we didn't, we just don't try to focus on maximizing short term earnings. We're saying over a cycle, what's the right thing to do? And so even if it gets into tough times, I like where we're positioned right now. We always appreciate your soothing tone, Paul, especially in these crazy times. I was going to get some time with your Raymond James C. O'Paul Riley. We'll talk to you soon. All right. Good to see you. Okay. Before we head off to a short break, let's highlight Dick Sporting goods. We are seeing the stock being defended by Evercore ISI analyst Warren Chang. Chang acknowledges that investors are right to be worried about bloated inventory from Nike adidas and under armor. And how that will impact margins at Dick Sporting goods, but Chang in his team thinks the concerns have become too overblown. Chang maintained an outperform rating and $160 price target on shares of Dick Sporting goods. Coming up, we'll speak with the CFL forward on the back of that company's third quarter Arnie DeCort. We'll be right back. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,56,2022-10-27 17:44:24
4278," Start video with the Here's a little bit of some of the other headlines that we are watching right now. First up, Samsung's third quarter profit misdannel assessments, the world's top maker of memory chips came out with the and smartphones, I should say, said demand for its semiconductors may recover later next year despite global economic headwinds. Samsung is expected to keep capital expenditure cuts to a minimum in 2023 and forecast increased demand for smartphones and wearables in the fourth quarter. The company also appointed third generation Air Lee J. Yang as its executive chairman. This comes as the company looks for, quote, stronger accountability and business stability in light of the current uncertain global business environment. And Shell's getting a boost today following the announcement of a new share buyback program resulting in an additional $4 billion of distributions expected to be completed by its fourth quarter 2022 results announcement. In addition, the British multinational oil and gas company plans to increase the dividend per share for the fourth quarter by 15 percent. This all coming a shower for the earnings peak in its latest quarter. And you deliver a raise in sales forecast for the year after hiking prices by a record 12 and a half percent in the third quarter. The increase in price and lead to the company's sales growth accelerated to 10.6 percent in the third quarter and consumer goods giant now expecting underlying sales growth for the full year 2022 to be above 8 percent. However, you deliver sees more negative underlying volume growth than in the first nine months as shoppers are starting to come back on essential spending. Soz, we continue to track shares of Ford as the company tightens its profit outlook for the year and pull the plug on autonomous driving platform Argo AI. Ford CFO John Lollard joins us now alongside Yahu Finance Senior Auto Correspondent, Product Supermanion John. Good to see you again here. Let's start with Argo AI getting a lot of attention here in the early going. Why did you pull out of this and what does that mean for your autonomous driving efforts? So when we looked at the business opportunity here, we saw that the ARC-2 is scaled profitable business was a long way off. Five years plus out. And so what we've decided is that we're going to reallocate our capital. We're going to focus on L2 plus and L3 driver assistance technologies where we can give our consumers time back in their vehicle in the near term and give them a better experience. And we think that that's going to be a much more profitable scaled business in the near term. So it's really about allocating our capital to where we see strengths, where we see the opportunities and adjusting our businesses. We see fit. Hey John, process here. If we want to fall upon that Argo discussion here, is it just that we can't have enough clarity as to what what it would take timing wise money wise to get to them for or level five? Well, I think from a technology standpoint, I'm not a technologist, but I think we have some of the best technologists in the world working at Ford Motor Company. And they believe that to technology there's a lot of hurdles that it needs to cross.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,57,2022-10-27 17:49:05
4279," I'm not a technologist, but I think we have some of the best technologists in the world working at Ford Motor Company. And they believe that to technology, there's a lot of hurdles that it needs to cross through before it's able to provide a scaled and profitable business. And that's what's key, a scaled and profitable business. Likewise, it's not just the technology. It's the business model that has to be built out. It's the number of vehicles to scale that across the country. It's the depots that are going to have to manage those vehicles. It's very expensive. It's going to take a significant amount of capital to build that out. It's going to take quite a bit of time in our opinion. And therefore, then we pivot it. We decided to allocate the capital to L2 plus and L3 driving technologies, as I said, which we think has a much more immediate opportunity for us as a business. When do you think we'll get to full self-driving, John, at this point? It's Julie here. I mean, does that happen 10 years from now, 20 years from now, never? Well, in the industry, it moved really quickly at first. And then it's that last 5% or 10% that's been difficult to solve. And it seems that we thought we were close in the next year for the last five years. And it's taking time for that to develop. And when you listen to certain technologies, they'll tell you that the problem is extremely difficult to solve. It's one of the most difficult problems facing us today from a technology standpoint. So our view is it's at least five years out. And with that, we pivoted. You've seen some higher supply costs right now. And for those suppliers that you're working with, how successful are the negotiations? Just to keep the supplies that you need to work through this backlog of vehicles that are perhaps lacking parts. Just to keep the costs the same, so that is a constant that you can expect going forward even into next year. So we have seen inflation, inflation costs hit our business. We saw that in the third quarter as we guided a billion, four to a billion, seven, adjusted even. We came in slightly above that. Inflation and supply costs were a big part of that number on a quarter over quarter basis being lower. So we're continuing to see that labor's type, supply chains, ocean freight, domestic freight, all very expensive right now. So we're seeing it across the board. So the important thing for us is to work with our supplier partners, look to drive efficiencies. We own a lot of the opportunities that we can work with with our supplier partners. They're being very proactive and collaborative with us. And I think it's the same for everybody right now. Inflation is hitting all of us, we have to work collaboratively, we have to find productivity, we have to work on the cost of reductions, eliminate waste. And we have plans to do that and we're implementing those plans. So I think it's a similar play for most companies out there today given the inflationary environment we're in. John, I was sad to see you in news this week and went viral the fiesta. It's gone. My friends had that back in high school. Are there other models in your lineup that you can cut to save some costs? Well, I think when you look at what we're doing there in Europe with the fiesta, it isn't, it is a product that's been around for a long time and it's beloved in Europe is that we're moving towards our electrification plan. And this has been part of our plan for a while. And that's just another step in that direction. And you'll start to see more electrified products come out in Europe over the next year. And it's a transition plan. And I think we're going to see more of that as we move to an electrified lineup as we move forward. And we're going to have production capability for electrified vehicles of 600,000 units next year on the way to 2 million units by 2026. So we'll see more of this as we transition and we move to new main plates and we move to new battery electric vehicles. So it's just part of the transition, the industry seeing as we move forward. Hey, John speaking of the industry, are you guys seeing any demand or sort of us a slow down coming from the economy or rising rates? So we are starting to see some signs that the inflation and the higher prices are impacting the consumer. What we're seeing is a narrowing of what consumers are willing to pay or a discount versus making certain of other businesses crunchy low weird openings needs primarily show",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,58,2022-10-27 17:53:16
4280," and the consumer. What we're seeing is a narrowing of what consumers are willing to pay or a discount versus the suggested retail price is a bit higher. We're also seeing that consumers are looking for longer-term loans, 84 months and beyond. Given that payments are higher, they're trying to keep that payment into a range that they think is affordable. And we're also starting to see the mix shift on some of our iconic vehicles like the F-150. We were seeing the turn rate on our highest series, like a Lariat, turn faster than a mid-series like an XLT. And we're starting to see that shift, where the XLT is turning quicker than the Lariat. So they're starting to see the early signs. We're watching them closely. We're going to keep abreast of that. But given the total macroeconomic environment, the inflation and what the consumer's been facing, we're starting to see that come through in some of the signs for us as business. And what about globally macroeconomically? If you think of China this most recent quarter there, you have to look through some of the different competitors in that space, I imagine, and look across some of the consumer demand to really understand and look into the data about where they're opting for some of the homegrown brands. As we've been seeing that show up in some of the other automakers industry, if you will, players, reports that have come out thus far. Well, when you look at China, it is a really dynamic market. And it is transitioning to beps much quicker than anyplace else in the world. And there are some very good local Chinese bev manufacturers. And they're having an impact on the industry. And when you look at our China business, Lincoln's doing very well. Our ICE business or internal combustion engine businesses is profitable. It's really the transition into battery electric vehicles in China that we're working on in a very tough and competitive market. Some of the local Chinese players are the real deal. And they're from medical competitors. And you're seeing that show up in the marketplace. All right, we'll leave it there. Ford CFO, John Lawler, always good to see you. And good to see you as well. Y'all find his prize at Supermanium. Talk to you guys soon. OK, the executive power hour on Y'all finance rages on. We'll chat next with ServiceNow CEO Bill Mdermit.

4281," you Now, seeing a lot of interest on Yahoo Finance following a better than expected quarter, and rather upbeat earnings call, the software company announced CEO Bill McDermott will also assume the role of Chairman Bill McDermott joins us now. Bill, always great to get some time to see on one or the service now ticker page on our platform stocks of 15 percent. My question to you, where's the recession? Oh, Brian, thank you very much. You know, the waters out there are choppy, and that's why the world seems to need the now platform and has demonstrated that in their decision making. Look, we have a platform that's truly a once in a generation deflationary force. We're seeing tremendous adoption for not only all things IT and digital transformation, but companies aren't hiring as much, in some case they're firing, and you got to do more with less so this idea of workflow automation to give employees a great experience. On the customer service side, you know, it's one thing to engage a customer to sell them something. It's another thing in the mid and the back office and the supply chain to optimize the whole experience, and that's where service now comes in. And I've been saying all along the digital transformation tailwinds were much stronger than the macro headwinds, but you do have to adopt to the environment. And I'm blessed to work with 20,350 women and men that did just that turn key ready to run solutions for a better world. Bill, I just got, I want you to expand on this a little bit because it is just such a a different message than we are hearing from some of the other companies within technology, and even within enterprise software, right? That they are seeing that choppiness, but it seems to be more of a problem. So, I mean, is it there's something more unique about the company or about the niche that you guys are filling right now? That's a great question, Julie. There's a very unique platform. You know, there was the operating systems, there was the database era, there was the application software era, we're now in the platform era. And what companies are trying to do is they're trying to drive productivity, they're trying to automate their supply chains, they're trying to rethink their procurement processes. They have to really do more with less. And the reason that choosing this platform is it is one holistic platform that was engineered for deflation, it was engineered for efficiency, and it was engineered to give fast return on invested capital. So, you're seeing a platform that's being adopted by one large manufacturer as an example that's taking a billion out of their procurement costs on the now platform, and we have them up and running in less than a hundred days. This is a major corporation. So, this has never been seen in enterprise software, and our brand is now becoming best known for that platform, the now platform, the digital transformation engine, or the center of gravity of digital transformation in today's modern enterprise. It is all about the technology, the people in our company are incredible culture, and are ever expanding ecosystem. It's really fascinating to see how quickly we were able to adjust to a tough environment with the best technology and the best team. You've got other companies within the tech landscape that want to take the applications that people use, companies are using, employees are using on a day and day basis and put it in, you know, a virtual reality, put it in the,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,60,2022-10-27 18:01:48
4282," Thanks so much for the time, Bill. Thank you very much, Brian. See you soon. Definitely. All right, guys, coming up. Big tech, taking a hit this early season. But what should investors expect from Apple? That's the big question. We're going to discuss that next. Brian, Brad, Andrew. You're, well, excited. Welcome back everyone. As earnings season continues to roll on crushing the tech industry, one major company, yet to report is Apple. So let's take a deeper dive into what we may see after the bell today when the tech giant releases its fiscal fourth quarter numbers. Bloomberg projecting revenue of more than $88 billion and earnings for sure to come in at $1.26 here. Of course this is still a business that relies so much on that demand for the iPhone. We've kind of heard from some of the telecoms players that if people are spending continuously with them, they're spending higher into higher price plans and that could potentially mean good news for Apple as well if you read through that. But we'll see exactly where those numbers come in at given the iPhone 14, the pricing strategy and for some of those other products as well, wearables and services is what I'm going to be watching. Strange setup here I would say for Apple on the one hand. Excuse me, they obviously don't have that advertising business as a snap Facebook and a Google that hammered those results. No, and they're the source of the troubles. Right, especially what's not here, exactly right. But then we saw a PC weakness by a lot of you who've been seeing increasingly PC weakness from a lot of companies right now. So how is that playing out in Apple? I will say this by and large, the street is expecting or position for Apple to beat not just a little bit on earnings, but potentially be big owing to a stromer growth profit margin and lower operating expenses and momentum on the iPhone 14. So anything that smells of a disappointment, you could be selling it very easily, see a sell off an Apple. So a couple thoughts on Apple here. After we had met it yesterday, there was this sort of narrative emerging that Apple was going to be the savior of the earnings season right coming out because Apple has been such a solid and consistent performer. So there's a lot riding on Apple and it's not just about the company stock, it's sort of about salvaging tech earnings, you know, exceptions like service now, notwithstanding. A lot of the large cap tech earnings have indeed been lousy. A couple other things to mention here. Obviously as we showed the various components, revenue sources for the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,61,2022-10-27 18:09:45
4283," Standing, a lot of the large cap tech earnings have indeed been lousy. A couple other things to mention here. Obviously, as we showed the various components revenue sources for the company, when the iPhone is still the behemoth here. The number two area now is indeed services as the company has been pushing for now for several years. So the estimate there of $19.97 billion. So that's going to be closely watched as well. We've talked a lot recently about Apple music. We talked a lot about it in the office. Apple versus Spotify. Now that Spotify may be raising its prices, we're going to talk about Spotify in a second. So that's something to watch as well. The third thing that I've been watching is the stock performance. It is down more than 16% year to date. If it does finish the year with that kind of a decline, and obviously we have some time left, it'll be the worst year since 2008 for Apple with that sort of 16, 17% decline. In fact, if it declines more than 7% or so, it'll be the worst year since 2008, which again, illustrates just how consistent our performer it has been. If you go back to 2008, there were only two other years that were down years since then for Apple shares. So a lot. And this is type of environment. I like Ty. No, it's very good to have a steady hand Tim Cook, former CEO of the company. Understands operations has pretty much seen every cycle over Apple. Apple may report disappointing quarter, but still just having him at the helm still, I think is very important. I think what he also understood that has clearly driven the culture at Apple now too, as much as we talk about your phone connection and your device being a necessity, he's also understood that there are little luxuries that you can layer on top of that necessity, and that is services. And that's what's going to build them out to being a $80 billion run rate business within services alone this year. Says the Apple Music Guy. All right, so let's get to that other music streaming service. We're talking about Spotify following a third quarter earnings miss. The shares are still down about 1.3% today. Our Alexander Canal taking a deeper dive into what's next for Spotify. So Ali, what are we looking at here? So to really understand what's going on with Spotify, you have to go back to the beginning, right? When the company first IPO via direct listing in April 2018, at that time, there was a lot of excitement about this company, the potential, the growth prospects. But there was this overhang when it came to the business model. Can this be a profitable business? Now more than four years later, we're still trying to answer that same question and investors and analysts, they're sort of getting tired of this growth at all cost strategy that Spotify seems to be implementing. So I spoke with CFRA analyst John Freeman and he told me that Spotify is a company that's not oriented towards profitability. And that at the end of the day, their margin disappointment is not short term pain, like CEO Daniel Eck has been stressing, but rather it's structural. And that's a problem. He suggested that potentially Spotify needs to explore new management that there could be elements to this business. That Eck just doesn't understand. And by the way, as of December 31, 2021, Eck owns 16% of Spotify's outstanding shares, maintained 31.9% of voting power. So he has a lot of say in this business. If you take a look at their operating expenses, that growth was 65% year over year. And it's from things that Spotify can really control, right, personnel. They're hiring at a time when a lot of tech companies are pulling back. They're acquiring companies. And it's this sort of sacrificing profitability for the sake of subscribers, no matter what the cost is. And that's not really going to fly on Wall Street too much longer. If the short term is just so challenged because of their own spending, what does the long term mean for this business? Yeah. And long term analysts on Wall Street, they're pretty optimistic that Spotify will be able to eventually hit those 30 to 35% margins. But I'm talking long term, like 2027 and beyond. There's a lot of optimism around potential price increases, JP Morgan estimated that if Spotify does raise its premium plan to $10.99, that could add incremental revenue of 200 million euro, which is significant. But again, we're back to this narrative of potential, potential, potential, and not really any tangible action. And I want to read this quote from Daniel Eck on the earnings call. He said, top line growth in the platform is a leading indicator for future success on all other financial metrics. And that's a pretty bold statement, right? Just focus on our revenue. Don't worry about our earnings. That sort of goes to show.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,62,2022-10-27 18:13:32
4284," cater for future success on all other financial metrics. And that's a pretty bold statement, right? Just focus on our revenue. Don't worry about our earnings. That sort of goes to show where his focus is right now for the company. And with this macroeconomic environment, if you weren't making money in 2019 when things were much better, how do you expect to make money moving forward? So there needs to be a lot of changes. You need to pull back on spending. So a lot of questions for this company moving forward. Yeah, potential might work when you're in an easy money environment. Less so now. Thanks so much, Ali. Appreciate it. Thanks. Coming up, shares of Overstock are trading lower after facing some revenue stepbacks. Social zwykights price, Shares of Oversock.com down nearly 10% this morning after the online retailer posted a report. second quarter to today, there's been excess inventory in the market. We and others are having special promotions. It's a tough time. The good news for overstock is even during this tough time we're turning a profit. This is our 10th consecutive quarter of turning a profit, which in our space is notable and we think we're doing it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,63,2022-10-27 18:18:27
4285," This is our 10th consecutive quarter of turning a profit, which in our space is notable. And we think we're doing it because we're providing a smart value to our customers. Our customers like what they can get for the dollars they're willing to spend. We provide that value to them. Jonathan, I was thinking to look at some of the census data, especially around housing right now, and the market's slowing at this point in time, during by range of factors, but none more pronounced than the fact that rates are rising. It's more expensive to get a home. There's less supply that's coming online. What does that mean in terms of trickle through to overstock? Well, definitely home sales when their robust help us. Today, what we're seeing is the categories on our site that are doing well are things that relate to home improvement. We've seen an uptick, which I noted on our call today in bathroom vanities. We've seen an uptick in mattresses. So people realize they may not be moving, but they want to make their homes where they live today better, more comfortable. So it's a different type of purchase than we've seen in the past. And they're also very deal conscious. They're shopping a lot. They're looking for the best deal out there. And we think that's where overstock excels. We're always providing smart value and trying to make dream homes come true for our customers. Jonathan, there's a lot of, like you mentioned earlier, there's a lot of inventory in the retail channel right now, Walmart target, you name it. And a lot of those retailers are playing to get very aggressive on promotions as holiday season. How aggressive are you prepared to get? Well, it's not just a question of planning to get aggressive. Everyone is being aggressive. You know, you've seen an increase. We held an overstock days event earlier this month. Prime, there's been a second prime day this year. People are already shopping for Christmas. I think the cyber five Black Friday through cyber Monday are going to be as promotional as ever. The good news for overstock is we've got lots of products, giftables, small appliance, things that are people, things that people look for in this fourth quarter as they shop for their home. But it will be a highly promotional fourth quarter. Johnson, one last thing for you, and it's about the sort of branding of the company. You guys recently rolled out a new ad campaign, emphasizing people's homes, and it's called Making Dream Homes Come True. And you saved the release, and this was last week, that this new campaign should dispel any lingering misconception that overstock sells liquidated or excess merchandise. Any plans to change the name of the company, which implies, right, overstock sort of implies that it's overstock. It's liquidated or excess merchandise. That's a great question. The good news for us is overstock's name recognition is extremely high. The not-so-good news is what you've said, and that's trying to associate our name more with home. Changing the name is an expensive proposition. Right now with our new national campaign, which includes a new ad that's out, entitled, Come On, Get Comfy, Brand Ambassadors that we've announced that are helping our social media presence. We think we can associate the overstock name with home. After all, no one goes to Craden Barrel to purchase crates or barrels to purchase things for the home. We think we can do the same for overstock. All right, comfy stock. I don't know if it has the same ring to it, but we'll see. What the measurement the metrics look like after the campaign overstock CEO Jonathan Johnson. I always budget speak with you. Thank you. Thanks. Guys coming up, we're going to break down some more earnings. We've got align technologies, automation, and then we're getting the drink. Hannah Heizer-Busch. That's on the other side of this book.

Get a little chewed up this morning. It's lower by about 17.5%. After missing estimates for its third quarter, it cited lower volumes, fx pressures, and higher promotions. Analysts are cautious when we margins here. And sending the shares lower here this morning is worth. This stock is down 72% year to date. So this is not the first time that we have seen declines like this afford this company. It's been struggling for a little while here. And the whole value proposition, et cetera, of getting braces in a different model. I think there's questions about this. This was one of the pandemic plays. Everybody wanted straighter, brighter teeth because they were on these Zoom calls. But now it appears to be on winding in Joe Hogan. We've talked him a bunch of times. And Reese, you're saying that sales have come under pressure because of continued macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence at the end of day to get a great smile, it's going to cost you some money. Did you guys have braces? I did. Oh, yeah. Big time. Yeah. Jack me up for life. All right. Automation, missed EPS estimates. But beating hourly on the top line, it shares our office. CEO Mike Manley says inventory in the industry remains constrained and retail sales of new and used vehicles is still below historical levels. Definitely a different tone here compared to what we heard from carm actors a couple of weeks ago. They reported earnings not a good quarter, stocked, absolutely slammed, but automation out of the gate here. Pretty good quarter for them. It is pretty good quarter. And at a time where we know that some of, at least for some of the used car retailers that have been out there just trying to get or hold on to inventory number one, and then what prices consumers were actually going to buy that inventory at. So it's actually a question of when they're going to be able to on the financing front have some more favorable terms that consumers are actually saying, all right, you know what, this is beneficiary for me and for automation actually maintaining some of their own revenue expectation. It also seems to be where which cars people are buying, right? So apparently automation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,65,2022-10-27 18:26:47
4287," automation actually maintaining some of their own revenue expectations. It also seems to be where which cars people are buying, right? So apparently, automation got its profits from premium luxury vehicles, which was up by 14% parts in service profits, also up 9.6%. So maybe that's the differentiator here. And Budweiser maker AB imbeb shares. So we are watching those as well. They're up 7% after the company reported mixed results, beating EPS estimates but missing narrowly on the top line. The CEO says consumer demand is still strong forward strengths and that beer is a resilient category. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. We're going to talk to Michelle Dukeris, that CEO of Budweiser tomorrow in studio. I look forward to seeing it, but I'm very focused on some of these categories besides beer that are doing well. Budweiser zero. That is doing scenes between pretty well and this beyond beer segment led by things like cut water and neutral vodka and the results are seen to be doing pretty well in a product called brutal fruit. I'm interested in brutal fruit. Yeah, it's a great name. All right, what is worse than brutal fruit? Liquid death or I mean, you just was the first thing you said cut water, cut water. Oh, yeah, that one. Now that's pretty good actually. Isn't that the, that's the mixed beverage, right? It's probably fizzy. Yeah, something like that. But they also on the pricing front had actually succeeded in pushing through some higher prices persuading consumers to shift to the higher price premium brands and all make the markets accept China.

4288," marc Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita along with the Nesfere. Here's what we're watching at this hour. A meta slump shares of Facebook's parent company plummet to their lowest levels since 2016 as investors turn sour on the social media giant, struggling metaverse Instagram woes and concerns about regulation all-wing on the company's outlook. A positive move higher, third quarter GDP in the US comes in better than expected. The economy growing at an annualized rate of 2.6% tempering increasing fears of a recession at least for now. And got that sinking feeling? Not Twitter shareholder is apparently the stock moving higher as Tesla CEO says he is ready to take the reins. Come Friday. We're going to talk about that a little later in the show. But let's take a look at the market action right now. We told you that positive GDP print that we got this morning that's certainly helping with investor sentiment. At least if you look at the down the S&P 500 right now, the Dow is up nearly 400 points. The S&P 500 trading pretty flat. The Nasdaq the one to watch. We've been talking a lot about tech earnings all week. We're going to break down meta just a bit here. But we do have Amazon as well as alphabet reporting after the bell. So we're going to be watching that one really closely already under some pressure there. Well, shares of meta are cratering after missing earnings estimates and seeing a decline in revenue for the third quarter. The media giant reporting its reality labs division lost over $9 billion so far in 2022 and forecasting operating losses in 2023 to grow significantly year on year. Meta joined the growing list of disappointing corporate results from tech companies. And as there's certainly a lot to parse through here, I mean, we can start with that reality labs number because remember last year, this is a company that made that pivot. They changed the name of the company thing. We're going to double down on the meta verse. And yet here we are saying that look, they lost $9 billion so far, roughly $4 billion in the quarter. We heard a lot of use of the word patience on the earnings call yesterday with Mark Zuckerberg saying, we know this is a long term bet. We think it's going to pay off. But certainly investors today saying, well, that's a long way out here. And I'm not sure where the company is headed right now when you think about so much of their revenue is still driven by digital ads. Things not looking as good in that direction. Yeah, that's right. So you're seeing a slow down in digital ads. We know that issues that Meta has also had with the IOS privacy issues. But the big problem is basically that you're saying long term believe us that we will be doing well with this metaverse investment that we're making. And investors are saying no, I mean, no, not especially right now. I think that the timing of this is very difficult for them because we are in a tighter monetary policy era. I know that Meta has big pockets, but still investors don't want to see this kind of investment in something so far out in the future when there's so much uncertainty right now. I mean, Facebook was a game changer when it came to social media. Will metaverse, the meta be a game changer for the metaverse going forward? That's yet to be determined. And Mark Zuckerberg is really asking investors to believe in him in this strategy, but it's far out. Well, and the other thing to watch here is the regulatory environment. When you think about how Facebook now meta became the company it is and were able to grow their platform. A lot of it was through acquisition. You look at something like Instagram. You look at WhatsApp. Well, now they're an environment where there's certainly nothing embraced from regulators. They're not able to go out and acquire companies. And I guess the question is, if they could, is there a play?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,67,2022-10-27 18:35:17
4289," I'll earn an environment where there's certainly nothing in place from regulators. They're not able to go out and acquire companies. And I guess the question is, if they could, is there a play they would make here within the metaverse? But that's going to continue to weigh on them too, because essentially they have to innovate their way out of all of this. And I'm not sure that the track record necessarily speaks for itself when you come to what they're doing internally versus how they've been able to grow through acquisition over the years. Yeah, and metaverse really something that, I mean, this should be more of a startup. This is what you're talking about is, when you're talking about acquisitions, so which other companies would they acquire in this field anyways as well? I mean, this is- It's a nice sense, very early. Yeah. So early on. I do want to point out that when you took a look at the market cap of meta right now, I mean, this is what also is scaring investors. We have seen a slow-instead idea decline. And right now in the S&P 500, it is number 21 as far as market cap is concerned. It's behind Exxon Mobile, it's behind Chevron, Proctor and Gamble, Master Card Home Depot. So it's falling quite a bit. Okay, let's keep the conversation going around meta. We've got Laura Martin, Needham, Senior Media and Internet Analyst. Laura, you know, we- And as an I were talking about what we heard on the call yesterday, we didn't even touch on the digital ads part of it. Real certainly one that Facebook meta has made a big bet on. They said they haven't been able to monetize it in a big way, but that was interesting in your notes. You said there was a deafening silence of this historical ad business that has been the big revenue driver over the years. Yeah, I thought the most interesting takeaway was the silence. And I thought the best question on the big call that everybody could hear was, you know, everything you're talking about is new. This all sounds very experimental. Why isn't it experimental to you and what about the old business? And I think, you know, and I think Mark's answer was like, either he's not focused on the old business or he doesn't think there's a future in the old business, but nothing they spoke about yesterday actually is the business that today is worth 300 billion market cap and used to be, we're 700 billion market cap. It's almost like he's walked away from the core business that is making all historically has made all the money. I thought that was the most interesting thing from the call. And Laura, I mean, when you're talking about walking away from the core business, I mean, should he be focusing on Facebook? Is this what investors want? They don't want this sort of experimental into the future. And especially during a time like this, do you think timing has something to do with this? I mean, I thought your point was fair that the market right now wants current cash flow. It wants to bring lower risks. So it wants cash on cash returns. I'm just, I think the way I read his choices is he's worried there isn't a core business unless he can stymie TikTok. Like that he's worried TikTok is going to take away all of his content creators and his audience. And like my space, when you may recall Facebook, took all of my spaces value away. It sounds to me like he's worried TikTok is gonna take all of his value away unless Reel's works, which is his knockoff of TikTok. So it just feels to me like this is a business at Facebook where every 10 years, Snap comes along and he has to copy it or die. TikTok comes along and he has to copy it or die. One of these days, you won't be successful copying the hot new thing. And I just wonder if there's actually a business here that is defendable. Yeah, I mean, Laura, to that point, you know, we were talking about the tough environment that is already dealing with in terms of regulation. We know what the track record is with these acquisitions, whether it is an acquisition or taking idea from another company. When you look at where they wanna go with the metaverse, I mean, how convinced are you that the innovation internally is there to make this, even if it's long term, a viable business? Look, I think Facebook has realized or meta now is realized that it doesn't control its destiny. It doesn't own its content because content creators are leaving it right now to go create content on TikTok and taking their fandoms with them. And it doesn't own its distribution platform because it's sitting on app.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,68,2022-10-27 18:39:28
4290," content creators are leaving it right now to go create content on TikTok and taking their fandoms with them. And it doesn't own its distribution platform because it's sitting on Apple and Apple is capricious and arbitrary about changing its rules. And Apple doesn't really care if it's rules hurt meta. So I think meta's answer to that is to let's create a new computing platform like ARVR glasses where we are the platform background. We charge everyone else 30% and we changed our rules capricious and arbitrarily and hurt apps on our platform. I think that's their play there. I think this really stepped up when Apple started making privacy changes in the fourth quarter of 2021. So I think he's realized like a lot of apps have that so long as Apple or Android control the policies on their platform and they are answering to regulatory fears on their end that and no app is safe, no app controls it's destiny. So his play with the metaverse is to actually own the hardware that is the platform that consumers use. So he can charge 30% and change rules. So you know what that said Laura what do you what do you value this company at? Is it about the future play? Is it a metaverse play or is it still social media company that just hasn't been able to compete in an increasingly crowded environment? I would say the latter that I think it's hard to value because it's unclear there is a core business here if they can't successfully replicate TikTok with reels. So I think the core business value is is a big question mark especially maybe outside the US is okay but in the US it really is worrisome and then the metaverse you have to put about in order to value this company you must decide is the metaverse going to work are we going to write off 10 to 20 billion dollars a year in his spending until he figures out it's not going to work. So I think that's the issue with valuing this company now. It's hard to value the core business in a network effects business it's going the wrong way and it's hard to value what the metaverse will be worth because at the earliest he's saying it's going to be worth something in 2030 which feels like a long way off for investors. So I think investors are doing the right thing today by using their liquidity and exiting the shares until it is clear what the value of either the core businesses or the value of those metaverse investments are both of which are really hard to value today. Yes certainly a steep fall from yesterday when you look at where the stock is down right now Laura always good to get your insight Laura Martin Needham internet analyst there. Well it's clearly been a rough week for big tech is economic headwinds make it make its mark on corporate results but the week is not over yet we've got two big ones on tap today Apple and Amazon next in line to report their results let's bring in Yahoo finances Ali Garfinkle who is looking ahead to the big numbers coming out after the bell today Ali. You're right Akeko it's been a rough week but it's not over till it's over we have two huge names here right first we have Apple what our analyst is going to be looking for and the big thing for Apple today I think is going to be iPhone sales Akeko I if you recall a couple of a little while back we got those reports about weakening iPhone demand and the company pulling back production the Apple stock went into a bit of a tail spin and his sense recovered however that is going to be the thing that investors are looking at spotlighting can the company in this consumer slowdown show that iPhone sales are resilient so that's Apple that's a huge that's going to be a huge one and on the other hand we also have Amazon reporting after the bell and for Amazon it's actually going to be in some cases a similar story we they analysts are looking for AWS growth they're looking for retail sales the company is coming off to prime prime events in recent months and there is hope that those prime events are really going to boost some of those numbers but it remains to be seen right this has been an incredibly difficult week for not only for meta for Microsoft for alphabet across the board those headwinds whether it's 4x inflation a hawkish fed consumer slowdown you name it it has hit just about everybody that said there is some optimism from what I've gathered from sources you know JP Morgan is saying that Amazon is its best idea in tech right now and wed bush is Dan ives does believe that we could see some winds out of apple today so we'll keep we'll keep you posted after the bell but there is still",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,69,2022-10-27 18:43:41

Okay, so the investor is looking to end things on a positive note, at least with these tech earnings. Allie, thanks so much for that. Well, strong quarters helping live shares of Caterpillar. We are seeing a big pop there up more than 8%. This is a company we often turn to as a bell weather for the broader economy. It earned $3.95 to share on revenue of $15 billion that marked a 21% jump from the same period last year. The Texas-based equipment maker facing rising material and higher freight costs. But greater equipment sales on higher prices help offset some of those inflationary pressures. The firm saying that it expects price heights in the fourth quarter more than offset higher costs in manufacturing. Well, coming up, temporary relief. The US economy posts positive growth for the first time in the year. But much of it down to the one-off impact of a narrowing trade deficit. So the recession is still coming, right? That's what a lot of people are asking today. We'll try to answer that question for you on the other side. What's the state's head state's population skills. In food prices, supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic recovery in demand have led to a broadening of price pressures and an increase in inflation. That was ECB President Christine Lagarde, setting the table for why the central bank doubled its key interest rate. The remarks at the press conference following its decision to hike by 75 basis points. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickery, who's on top of all the big moves coming on the back of this.

4292," The thing I want to point out is that the Euro is net down after the move. Let me just show you the intraday price action since midnight. And you can see we got some fireworks here, but right around parity with the US dollar. As you said, a Kiko, a Christina Lagarde and company doubling the short term interest right there to 150 basis points. But the outlook for the future, not quite as hawkish as the Federal Reserve. At least that's what traders are saying right here. Now, let me put a three-year chart. And you can see clearly the Euro is still in a very firm downtrend. As I pointed out just a second ago, it is at parity with the US dollar. Now, overnight, we are going to get an interest rate decision from the bank of Japan. And let me show you what's been happening over the last three years with the US dollar versus the Japanese yen. Dollar is strengthened appreciably. Here is a year-to-date view. And then over the last seven days, this is going to show that supposed Yen Turvention that happened last Friday when Kiko, you and I were calling this in real time, as there was something underfoot in the market. And you can see the dollar net down since then. That is a market departure since the last time there was an intervention by the BOJ over there. You can see not really having much effect two weeks later that high was taken out by the US dollar. We'll have to see what comes tomorrow. Kiroda, as we have saying, he is the BOJ head there. He's out next April and he has doubled down on his strategy. Standing by yield curve control, we'll have to see if the market forces his hand overnight. We'll be watching. Thanks so much, Jared Blyckery. Let's take a closer look at some key stocks and sectors. Our next guest is seeing value in web browsers, Coke bottles, and fracking suppliers here with more is Frank. Brian Frank, CIO Frank funds and Frank Valley Fund Portfolio Manager. Brian, thanks so much for joining us. You are basically saying that tech, as you see it, is cyclical. So what? Tech out, value in. Yeah, absolutely. We feel like this is the golden period for value investing. It looks like it could be a lost decade for index funds because they're heavily weighted towards tech. And tech is very cyclical. People don't tend to realize that when they get excited about all the growth that happens in tech. But as we've seen with MEDA and the other earnings reports coming out, it's pretty cyclical. What do you make of this divergence that we're seeing? You mentioned during the break that it's interesting to see how even with disappointing earnings coming from these MEDA tech names, that's not necessarily dragging down the rest of the market. That's a bit different than what we have seen in the previous quarters. Oh, absolutely. And I think it's kind of a sign of healthy market function. The market actually cares about fundamentals again. The last few years, it was just about what's the Fed going to do to make everybody rich and drop money from the sky. And now it's about, oh, is your company actually profitable? Are you actually growing? And that's a sign of good market function. However, there seems to be things under the surface that are showing a lot of weakness. So it is something to be concerned about. Well, and you said it kind of reminds you of 99, too, right? It does remind me of 99, 2000, which was that golden period of value investing. All the value investors look kind of stupid in the late 90s, not buying those tech stocks. But then, boy, was there a reversal. And value stocks actually went up in that period when the Nasdaq melted down about 80% from its highs. So where should investors be now? Because you're looking at some interesting names here. You're looking at Opera. Tell us a little bit. So Opera is a tech company, but it's a lot less cyclical, we think, because it's just a web browser. It's the largest independent web browser. And the way a web browser makes money is when you actually type in to do a search. So it's a growing business. They used to only focus outside the US. Now they're focusing more in developed markets. And they're having some great success. But what most attracts us to that company is they're doing something that the big guys can't. Because the valuation is so low, they bought back 20% of the company in a very short period of time. So they have the cash to do it. They have a low valuation to do it. And big tech just can't compete with that. Another name you say you like Coca-Cola? You say this one's recession resistant. Sure. Yeah. You cut out the crews. You know, you cut out the big vacation, the big spending. But you don't necessarily cut out the day-to-day treats like Coca-Cola. We like a company called Coca-Cola Femsa, which is a distributor in Latin America. And their largest bases are Mexico and Brazil, which have actually had a stronger currency this year against the dollar. We just saw from Jared about the meltdown of the Japanese yen and the euro. But Brazil and Mexico are actually getting stronger against the US dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CFaeFaQzJ0,71,2022-10-27 18:52:29
4293," a stronger currency this year against the dollar. We just saw from Jared about the meltdown of the Japanese yen and the euro, but the Brazil and Mexico are actually getting stronger against the US dollar. Those economies look to be doing okay and they're growing a lot of volume coming out of COVID with their Coke. And Coca-Cola, I should say. Going off the US dollar, I mean, tell us what you think. How should investors be positioned given the strong US dollar? And should they be in multinationals that are offering services and abroad and getting a lot of their revenue from abroad? Where do you see things? So in the Frank Value Fund, which is the value fund that I run, we focus on companies that have control over their prices. So in a multinational, if you have a great brand, you can raise your prices when you're facing inflation like that. For other people who are more dependent on other companies or maybe a commodity or something, you don't have that pricing power. And it's been a bloodbath this year, I think, across the board, even though we're actually up in the fund kind of finding some good values. However, you have to be very careful and I think those multinationals will be able to raise their prices if they have a good brand. With that said, though, we have seen a bit of a softening in the dollar when you compare it to where things have been. In part, someone argue because the expectation with the Fed is that they'll at least move a little slower, if not a pause in terms of the rate hikes. When you look at what goes into the fund, I mean, how do you factor that in? What is your outlook in terms of how significant those effects had ones will continue to be? We hope that they slow down, but when it comes down to it, even if the Fed pauses, they're still the most aggressive central bank in the world. And it's going to keep the dollar strong. So that's good for companies that are buying goods that come from abroad, but if you're exporting, it's going to be a tougher market. So I think that's why I'm exporting to Japan. The purchasing power has declined so much out there. So I know people get excited about a Fed pause, but you got to ask, why are they pausing? They were talking about being so aggressive and now they're pausing. Maybe there's something wrong with the economy, so that could be a whole nother leg down for stocks you have to watch out for. Yeah, yet another trigger for those recession fears. Brian Frank, CIO, Frank Funs, and Frank Value Fund Portfolio Manager. Appreciate your time today. Thank you very much. Well, coming up, reverse gear, Ford and Volkswagen will shut the fully autonomous driving unit they backed, but others are still doubling down on the technology.

4294," i We saw that the ARC-2 has scaled profitable business was a long way off. Five years plus out. And so what we've decided is that we're going to reallocate our capital. We're going to focus on L2 plus and L3 driver assistance technologies where we can give our consumers time back in their vehicle in the near term and give them a better experience. And we think that that's going to be a much more profitable scaled business in the near term. That was Ford CFO John Loller speaking to our morning team earlier today. The group recorded an $827 million net loss in the third quarter. That was partly due to cost related to its autonomous vehicle unit. It's joining Volkswagen and taking a sharp turn away from fully autonomous driving and they are shutting down the Argo AI unit they both backed. But what about that argument that self-driving cars are the future? Prost Supermanian here to tackle that question. Prost we always knew it was going to be a tough hurdle. But it does feel like companies are sort of saying it's now or never is it worth the investment. Yeah, it's like this challenge of our times what they're kind of phrasing it as. And you know like level two level three where the car can do some things on its own but you're still there with the string wheel. That's doable. They're working on four blue crews and GM super crews things like that. It's the level four and five where there is no steering wheel perhaps and you are not doing anything. That is like what John was saying. One five years from now, not next year five ten who knows fifteen. I think that's the problem. There's sort of seeing that with Argo.

4300," As we've been talking about Amazon plunging in today's session, we're going to be able to discuss this. packet here. The 3Q revenue was fine. The up-income missed. And the 4Q revenue and up-income was light. What in management say? Management said that various macro headwinds are impacting the consumer and consumer demand more so in Europe than in the US. And then also headwinds are impacting companies who are looking to control costs. And you're seeing that show up at AWS and also at the ad business. So on the guide, the revenue guide was 7% below consensus at the midpoint. And then the operating income guide of 0 to 4 billion was below consensus at 5 billion. And also investors were looking to have a five handle on that guide and they didn't get it. So all in, we cut 4Q numbers. We cut longer term numbers. Our 23 revenue is 7% lower, EBITDA, 12% lower, price target 150 from 195. We kept outperform even kind of amidst like more muted growth next year. Just given we should still see margin expansion and investment spend should decline. We're watching Amazon stock taking here on the day. When we think about some of the high growth internet names that the markets have based their bullish run over for the past several years on and only to see that kind of decline over the past almost year and aggregate now at this point, using November as that peak point. With all of that in mind, what is the normalization for those high growth internet names now? Reemerging from the Fed's tightening policy from the consumer sentiment right now and spending habits? Yeah, no, it's fair. I mean, it was quite a week, right? And just to maybe to try to sum up Amazon versus Alphabet versus meta, starting with Amazon, you know, it was really macro related. Inflation, interest rates, energy costs, Ukraine war, impacting the consumer as I mentioned, impacting company spend, which is seeping into the retail business AWS and advertising. And you saw that partially hit in 3Q and then it was it was implicit in their 4Q guide. And then they're also dealing with kind of lingering spend issues, but they're working on it. They called out fulfillment spent, CapEx spend down $10 billion this year, which is so they're working on it. For Alphabet, it's also macro, mostly macro related. You do have competition from TikTok at YouTube that they're dealing with. And the other thing I would say is that they had, you know, accelerating head count growth that now they're switching on a dime and they're going to start to slow it down, but it's going to take a minute. And then meta is different, I think, than the Alphabet and Amazon in the sense that it's macro. It's TikTok more squarely at Core Facebook and at Instagram. And then it's self-inflicted wounds of spending at historic levels going into next year, which is kind of opposite of what Amazon and Alphabet are doing. And it feels a little tone-deaf just given the macro issues. So that's why we moved to the sidelines on meta after they reported and gave guide. But no, it's clearly been challenging. But we still like Amazon and Alphabet, great companies, and they are dialing in spend, which makes sense given the kind of current environment. John, which team's management teams? I have the ones you just mentioned, Metta, Alphabet, and Amazon here, which management team is not tone-deaf when it comes to expenses here?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,1,2022-10-28 13:50:09
4301," John, which team's management teams, other ones you just mentioned, Metta, Alphabet and Amazon here, which management team is not tone deaf when it comes to expenses here? Well, I think Alphabet and Amazon, you know, Alphabet is, you know, slowing hiring spend and you're going to start to see off-ex growth start to slow, which makes sense. With their ad business that, you know, kind of missed across the board in 3Q, with weakness in like financial services, which we never heard them call out before. And then Amazon, you know, same, you know, littered in that call last night, and in the call back was, you know, kind of working through cost containment efforts. But for these companies, you know, they're like battleships. You can't just turn it on a dime. So if you take steps to relieve or have cost growth to accelerate, it just, there's some lag there. So it's going to take several quarters for it to play out. But you are like at Amazon, you are seeing it. Like they had his door expenditure filament, catbacks the last couple of years with the pandemic. That's declining significantly. And there are some efficiencies that you're seeing. But again, it's taking a little bit longer than, you know, everyone would like. John, if I'm not mistaken, you still have an outperform rating on Amazon, which one can tell from hearing your commentary here. Do you still have the $150 price target? And do you think that today's the bottom? Or that we're in a short-term bottom? Or do you think there could be more downside before we see some buying come back in? Yeah, I mean, I think there would, yeah, obviously. And it was down, you know, kind of the last couple days with Alphabet and Meta, you know, kind of missing as well. Yeah, I mean, it's trading at like 10 times you would die, 3% free cash flow yield. You know, it's the valuation is fairly appealing for, you know, a company with market leadership and global market leadership and several big verticals. So, yeah, you know, I think the selling, it could be a near-term kind of low. And then I think people investors are going to have to see where sell side numbers shook out, where their numbers shook out and see how confident they are, you know, kind of stepping in here.

If you've been watching, you probably know we've heard several key companies warn of slowing consumer demand. The latest coming from Intel and Amazon. These red flags caught the attention of the man sitting to my right. That is one grinds on the and that's where you find a thing. Yeah, it's not breaking news. Julie, all right. Look, yes, I'm been looking for signs of recession as we have seen before. I pottery enter 2023 right off the jump here. I really thought it was interesting what we heard from Ford CFO john Lawler on our network yesterday. Take a listen. We are starting to see. Some signs that the inflation and the higher prices are impacting the consumer. What we're seeing is a narrowing, of of what consumers are willing to pay, or a discount versus the suggested retail prices is a bit higher. We're also seeing that consumers are looking for longer-term loans. 84 months and beyond, given that payments are higher, they're trying to keep that payment into a range that they think is affordable. 84 months loan. I didn't even realize you can get that. I thought it was 72 months. Wow, that's something. But anyway, perhaps a sign of the times. Next, I'm watching, of course, I've been talking about Amazon all morning long, Amazon really highlighting, I think, on their earnings call yesterday that the consumer is under increasing stress and they have, in fact, slowed down their pace of buying on the Amazon platform. Next up, Intel warning. Also, Intel on its earnings call last night, just, I think, reaffirming that there remains a glut of PCs in this market for whatever reason. People are still just not buying PCs. Maybe they bought one during the pandemic for whatever reason. They're not buying a new PC. And then lastly, we'll have more from our interview with T-Mobile CEO Mike Seaver in the 10 o'clock hour. But he echoed, I think, what we hear from AT&T and perhaps even Verizon, Brad, that consumers are maybe just delaying a little bit when they pay their bills. Yeah, we're seeing. None of this says we're in a recession now, just a little... Well, they're all saying slow. They're not saying contraction many of them. Exactly. And even in some of the delinquency that we have heard about, it seems interesting that you've still got people that are spending more as well for the bills, whether it's because of the pricing changes that Verizon has rolled out on AT&T, but also the prices for the phones and how long they want to pay that phone off for, perhaps opting into a higher quality. 84 months. Yeah, but... I'm going to get swashed if I don't fire the take. Fire the take. Fire the take. Here's the take for the day. Here's where we go. There we go. Recession signs are mounting B on high alert. I guess mounting fits the mountains in the back. They're not killers. You've got your vernacular. Interesting. Just top graphical work as always. But yes, just keep these things in your back pocket because they're probably going to be a bigger thing perhaps as we go into next year. Absolutely. Lots of keep tabs on there. Everyone coming up, Apple shares are higher by about 4 and a quarter percent. Absolutely. Yeah. Coming up short on iPhone sales in the fourth quarter, we're going to take a deep good guy into that report.

I'm Brian Sasi alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. It's not only in earnings heavy morning with the profit warning by Amazon hanging over the markets, it's a busy day for econ data and Julie fresh read on consumer confidence coming in here. Yes, coming in and coming in a little bit ahead of estimates very slightly. 59.9 is the reading from the University of Michigan versus the 59.6 that was estimated. The current conditions index a little bit higher even than that 65.6 versus the 65 estimated expectations 56.2 a tick better than estimated and inflation expectations pretty much in line 5% is the one year inflation expectation 2.9% over the next 5 to 10 years. This is the final read on these numbers here. So this is not necessarily absolutely fresh data here. But nonetheless, we are seeing some areas of strength here as pointed out by Joenshu who is the survey of consumers director at the University of Michigan. We are seeing buying conditions for durables of 23% in the month. So some still not terribly discouraging indications. We talked about PCE earlier. Consumer spending comes out as a part of that PCE report or alongside it I should say. And personal spending ticked up 6% in September which is better than estimated. It's been interesting to track the divergence among some of the affluent parts of the economy but as well here low income consumers are really pointed out within this report too. Low income consumers reported sizeable gains in overall sentiment. Consumers with considerable stock market and housing wealth exhibited notable declines though in sentiment. Yeah. That is this too Brad. Noting at the bottom uncertainty over inflation expectations remains elevated. Indicating inflation expectations are likely to remain unstable in the months ahead. Not probably what the Federal Reserve members want to hear. Yeah. Thank you. We're also continuing to watch shares of Apple this morning. Those shares were actually higher just before we got to the 10 a.m. hour right now moving on up by about 5% on the day after the tech giant beat earnings expectations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,4,2022-10-28 14:03:21
4304," Those shares were actually higher just before we got the 10 AM hour right now moving on up by about 5% on the day after the tech giants beat earnings expectations for the fourth quarter But fell short on iPhone sales joining us now for a deeper dive into the quarter JP Morgan head telecom and networking equipment Analysts to meet chatter G. So me great to have you here with us this morning first We got to look at the iPhone sales. I mean this is still 60% of the product revenue 47% of the overall revenue that they bring in and we don't get that breakout of The actual kind of generations that are being purchased But if there's anything that you would point to what would you say about the consumer with the relation to some of the iPhone sales Demand that we've seen this far Yeah, no, thanks for having me on the show and happy Friday guys so Really solid earnings brand and you saw a solid revenue print from Apple as well I think creative to the iPhone to your question specifically What you can see is Apple's threading the balance between sort of volumes and pricing or the pricing increases that they've taken in Dash and markets very well, right? So you can see this obviously a delicate balance. You're given how consumer spending has been tracking that you need to really be able to drive do Deliver resident results and Apple has been able to do that. I mean we've in our data seen some changes here and there in the sense that There are customers that are moving to the pro and the pro max on the iPhone 14 lineup So preferring the feature upgrades and then on the rather buying the base model Sometimes preferring to create down into the iPhone 13 But I think net net what you really want to take away from the iPhone results that you mentioned is one Apple remains Supply constrained in the ramp order So that's given some of that miss but that said it's still managed to thread that balance between pricing and volume fairly well Do you think I'm going forward? You know we've been talking about potential if not recessionary signals certainly slow down signals from a number of different companies Is that going to start to affect Apple in the out quarters? I mean when you get an Amazon for example making a holiday forecast that is broadly disappointing Does that have implications that maybe people are going to buy? The lower priced iPhone for the holidays or maybe they're going to get set mouse entirely Yeah, no great question. I think how we've been looking at this is as you think about the September quarter that they just reported on the DeSemo holiday quarter You probably will not see as much impact on in these two quarters because there's more of sort of the buying at the higher and people probably using More and more the monthly installment plans and still preferring to go for the higher end products Typically what happens you do see a sort of mix down going into the March and the June quarters And if you do I mean we're not really going to bet here that Apple's going to become completely immune from the macro impact But clearly there's a product cycle in their favor where they've just launched the new phone So when you think about even the holiday quarter I think that the momentum there carries through the December quarter as you get into March and June We sort of have to evaluate whether consumer spending stands But again, what you probably find is it's not going to be a surprise that volumes are going to suffer a bit more As consumer spending pulls back but also because you've taken the price increases in some of these markets So again, you're trying to sort of balance it out in terms of when you where you get to in terms of revenue outcomes And there's that's what I think the real sort of upside here is given how the back row backdrop is Obviously not everyone on the street is expecting iPhone revenues to be up next year But what you're seeing now is a greater likelihood that iPhone revenues could be flat to out next year Even despite the consumer spending pullback as well as sort of comping very strong growth numbers So that's where the upside is that's probably what the shares are showing you is that people are believing in Precigling the resilience of the portfolio including iPhone So me how big of a downside risk is China? China market itself obviously has been soft, right? Like so we're seeing that across the Android we use a lot more than we're seeing with Apple I think two things are in favor of Apple when it comes to market share in that country Obviously some of these restrictions that have impacted while we are still continue to sort of play out in terms of benefits For Apple not only are you sort of selling more phones to new sort of breeders and switchers but obviously",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,5,2022-10-28 14:07:23
4305," to sort of play out in terms of benefits for Apple. Not only are you sort of selling more phones to new sort of breeders and switchers, but obviously there's a large install base of Huawei phones that we've certainly come through the market and have to purchase new phones. So iPhones have the opportunity to capture that share. And you're also benefiting from the product cycle and consumers increasingly sort of switching into the iOS ecosystem, the benefits of the ecosystem are starting to play out in that country as well. But clearly it's a market that's a bit more challenged on the consumer spending side. And particularly for us, the watch point is some of the events coming up around the e-commerce events coming up in that country and sort of what promotions are driven around those events. And so we could see a demand update around those events, promotion events in the country. But we're closing monitoring, going to monitor that and see how sort of it trends from here on. Apple just raised prices for music subscribers. Do you expect within the services realm that they're going to be increasing some of their other prices? I would say yes. I mean, the expectation would be that you have headwinds both in terms of inflation as well as in terms of sort of currency and the international markets that you need to adjust for. And so the combination of that is probably going to be reflected in a pricing sort of across the board, product, services, et cetera. So you're really looking at no broad base price increases at this point. Not all of it necessarily means that you're of setting effects on a completely, you're probably still going to have a net sort of modest negative in relation to sort of when you net that out. But I think that's a fair assumption that you have this inflationary backdrop and currency that's going against you in the international markets so you do need to raise prices. And again, I think what's really the results of showing you is a pricing power that both the products and the services have, which is again, getting appreciated by the short price reaction today. JP Morgan, analyst, Simeek Chatterjee, Simeek, really appreciate the time and the context that you've provided around these Apple earnings that we've been showing on all morning here. Thanks so much. And everyone switching gears, let's take a look at the markets right now as we are just about 38 minutes into today's trading activity, taking a look at the NASDAQ. We've seen that move in deposit of territories up by about half a percent right now, changing this over to an intraday look and perhaps we'll get fancy with some candlestick charts. Also, that's up by 51 points there. Dow Jones Industrial Average, you're seeing that up by about 1% right now early in trade. And then additionally the S&P 500, that's up a little bit more than half a percent. Do you want to dive into some of the retail names though here on the day as well, especially considering what Amazon had kind of warned within their earnings call after they reported earnings, saying that consumers are cutting their budgets and trying to save a little bit of money. And we'll make this equal way to just for the sake of giving you a full review of what's taking place. And some of the retail landscape, perhaps investors taking warning to that comment from Amazon on that call, Amazon of course on the day, down by about 10%. But look at some of the other names that are also moving and concert with it in the retail sector right now. You've got target down by about 1.9%. You've also got Wayfair and yeah, Saisy's favorite bet bet and beyond, down by about 8.6%. Here, however, holding onto some gains here to end out the week, you've got Walmart still in positive territory that's up by about 2.10% of a percent there, perhaps the brick and mortar play investors leaning into that Nike is also up by about 4.10% right now too. So we'll keep a close eye on this retail sector as we go on. Clear, Brad. Bedbeth is not my, it's Costco. Ah, yes. That $1.50 hot dog. What they have done this past year, keeping prices at $1.50 in this inflationary environment. I mean, that's impressive. I don't want to confuse our viewers with my sarcasm. So I will. I appreciate you. Absolutely. Craig Alphabet is closing out its poor earnings being defended by Goldman Sachs, tech analyst Eric Sheridan. Sheridan is retaining a by rating on Alphabet stock and Saisy's fair value at $135 a share. So Sheridan, while the macroeconomic conditions will likely impact the short-term narratives, remain constructive on the opportunity for search and YouTube in terms of compounded revenue growth, especially for the latter, on the back of the opportunity for short-form video and connected TV. Coming up, Tesla is facing an investigation into its auto powered feature in Julie's back with that plus more of Saisy's top headlines. jealous expression",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,6,2022-10-28 14:11:51
4306," MINORM KOPES Let's get that in business now. Take a look at some other headlines we're watching. The Department of Justice is reportedly launching a criminal investigation into Tesla over its past claims that its vehicles can drive themselves. The Security's Exchange Commission launched a similar investigation. It has the authority to enforce investor protection laws, all this according to the Wall Street Journal. Tesla's autopilot has been under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for about a year now, but these new criminal investigations represent a more serious level of scrutiny. And credit card debt making a comeback. Card balances fell in the early months of the pandemic. They've since made a U-turn back to pre-pandemic levels. According to data from Equifax, the U.S. total card balance hit $916 billion in September. That's nearly identical to December 2019 levels. This comes after many credit card issuers loosened standards to get people borrowing again as the economy reopened. And the Buffalo Bills have released renderings for their new $1.4 billion, $60,000 seat stadium, almost seven months after creating the framework of a deal. The images include one look at the stadium's exterior and the interior of the open-air stadium. It's scheduled to open in 2026. It'll be across the road from the old stadium, though its development has attracted criticism due to the record $850 million in taxpayer funding. Thanks so much Julie.

4307," Yeah, we'll finance this process. Supermanion has the details here, pros. Amen. Yeah, so they did, you know, sort of talk about operating profit up 68% that did miss estimates slightly, but revenue was better too. They reiterated their operating margin guidance for the, for the full year up to seven to eight and that percent, the upper range of that. And also the revenue will be up eight to 13% higher as well. But there is some sort of concern about the future and things like the supply chain crisis and things like that. We've quote here from CEO Oliver Blumat talking about how we will be faced with crises during the next decade, Jeep Little Crisis, supply chain issues. So they're kind of seeing that, yes, things are good right now, but we may be sort of in a murky area in the future. I want to note that they also said they have 3,000 pre-orders of EVs in Europe alone, so they're working through that battle. Well, that's pretty strong for them right now. Brad, when I'm in, I'm in, pros, excuse me, when I saw Elon Musk walking to Twitter's headquarters carrying a sink, I made him know, I'm like, I have to ask pros. That is time that he would have spent perhaps on the manufacturing floor of Tesla. I mean, is this a big distraction? You know, when I heard that potentially he's going to be the CEO of Twitter as well. You add that to all the different things that he's doing right now with SpaceX, OpenAI, Boring Company, etc. When does it really take a bite out of his sort of attention span and ability to perform at Tesla? Tesla, working at Tesla and being a CEO there is, that's a full-time job, right, for anyone, 24 or 7. So, you got to ask, when is that actually going to, I think this is going to be a great thing, is that actually going to, I think this is like the, maybe this is the ones that straw that breaks the camel's head, camel's back right now. It's really interesting. I mean, especially considering the broader automotive landscape and all of the attention that's been thrust towards electric vehicles right now, for who is winning the battery battle, we've seen a lot come out over the course of these past two weeks and see what Ford, what GM, what Tesla, what Volkswagen is saying about their batteries. Do you get a sense of who really has the lead in that category? It's hard to say. And we see a lot of the traditional automakers like GM and Ford and even Volkswagen tell about building battery factories, acquire materials that they need for the next few years to make these cars. I think there's some analysts that say, hey, is there enough material out there to actually make, you know, what is it? Millions of EVs by 2025, 2026 and even more so beyond that. So, that's a, that's a big question. You have seen GM and Ford say we've acquired materials for the next couple of years. We've confirmed that. The question is what's going to happen after that. And Tesla, to confirm that they're going to make that lithium refinery in Texas. So they are trying to get that materials, the raw materials there too. Prosso, Maine, always going to see you.

Great.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,8,2022-10-28 14:20:47
4308," The Canabe Growth is looking to fast track is entry in the US cannabis market by creating a new holding company to house its US cannabis investments. Canabe Growth, CEO David Klein joins us now. David, welcome to you on this Friday morning. I was talking to an executive at a constellation brand's investor in your company. They said from their perspective, this is a win, win, win. Why is this a win for you? This is a win for us because it allows us to put together three really strong cannabis companies in the US under this canopy USA umbrella. And begin to address the $50 billion opportunity that is the US cannabis market. And David, it's been tricky, right? Because of the interdiction on a federal level against marijuana in the United States versus what we have seen in Canada, you guys, not just you, but many of the cannabis companies have done, had to do some real gymnastics, right, to get around all of that. How does this tell us on a concrete level what this means for you, how this sort of enables you to access that opportunity you're talking about? Yeah, I think the important point is that we are putting together strong branded opportunities to address that US market. And we need to do so in a way that allows us to ensure that we are keeping our investors like constellation safe from any potential risks that they may have. And so we think that allows us the ability to the flexibility to actually be more aggressive as we address the US market and in the structure that we've outlined creates that security for investors like constellation. David, it's been a while since we talked to some of the team at a canopy. You know, we were familiar with prior management, very much ran canopy like it was the Wild West. And former CFO of constellation brands talked to us about the financial discipline. You and any new executives, your team have put into the company. Yeah, so we talk about ourselves as pioneers because there are challenges that present themselves on a day and a day out basis in this really tricky market. But we think it's really important to focus on execution, which is, which is why we love this canopy USA structure because it allowed, it allows businesses that we already have an interest in like acreage, one and jetty to begin working together to extract costs to energies across the business to extract revenue opportunities across the business as the US market opens. And then clearly as we apply that to Canada, the Canadian market continues to evolve. We continue to have to differentiate ourselves versus a growing competitive set. And I think that is just execution on a day and a day out basis. And it's really not about driving the story of cannabis anymore. It's about executing the business of cannabis. Do you believe that we will see passage of the marijuana banking bill and other legislation that allows for the cannabis industry and for your company to experience the growth that it's anticipating and tapping into this market in the US? Look, there are five more states that have cannabis on the ballot for legalizing adult recreation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,9,2022-10-28 14:24:52
4309," of cannabis on the ballot for legalizing adult, adult recreational use this fall. So, and already two thirds of Americans live in a state where or local that where cannabis is legal in some form. We need the federal government to catch up and there's just a lot of momentum building there. We've seen bills in Congress, both houses of Congress, both parties. And then, you know, a bit of a breakthrough a few weeks ago when the administration announced the beginning of their support for what we believe will ultimately be full federal permissibility. David, in Canada where there is more broad legalization and permissibility, the market hasn't quite turned out to be as profitable as you and your peers might have hoped for. How do you think the U.S. should maybe take some lessons away or what would you hope for if and when we do get full legalization that is different from the Canadian model? Well, I think one of the things we can do in the U.S. currently is we can talk to our consumers and we can educate our consumers and we can talk about what cannabis is. And it's a legitimate and important consumer product and I think being able to just connect with our consumers a little differently in the U.S. market would be a differentiator versus Canada. But you know, as it relates to Canada, we still think the market opportunity in Canada is an outstanding opportunity. Here it's a $7 billion industry versus the $50 billion industry in the U.S. But that is a very large market and we're still in the early days of the market really shaking itself out to be the market that we know what will become. Respective of the quiet period that you are in right now ahead of earnings, I got a wonder, you know, naturally for the larger space, how the cannabis industry at a whole is managing through a higher operational expense environment and what that potentially means for just having the financial cash flow in order to whether and navigate even through some of the transitions that you're seeing here. Yeah, clearly, every company is fighting the battle for us with the cost inflation and supply chain disruption. For us, we've been able to manage through it nicely across our businesses. We've had some supply shortages in our stores and BICO vaporizer business. But for the most part, we've been able to manage through with good planning and focus on execution. But we're in the same boat. I think that every other industry is in. I'll leave it there. Canopy growth, CEO David Klein. Good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. T-Mobile CEO has some tough talk with rivals Verizon and AT&T after better than expected quarter T-Mobile CEO Mike Sebert joins us for chat coming up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,10,2022-10-28 14:29:21
4310," gide T-Mobile is out with above consensus earnings and new customer additions. The company also lifted its guidance for operating profits and cash flow. I caught up with T-Mobile CEO Mike Severt. You know, we've been saying for years that this company has a unique opportunity to be the first ever in the history of our industry to one day offer the best value simultaneously with the best network. And that day is kind of arriving and customers are noticing. And it's so huge. I mean, you think about right now, customers are anxious. The economy has full of questions and what they're looking for is a great value from a brand they trust. And that's T-Mobile. Mike, I've talked to one of your competitors recently. You said, you don't have customers who are laying paying their bills. Are you seeing that? No. In fact, bad debt levels look to us consistent with 2019 pre-pandemic levels. And 2019 was one of our best years ever. So we have seen it creep up from those pandemic levels, but only to one of our best years ever. So we're very interested in this. We're watching in voluntary churn. That's when people don't pay and have to leave. We're watching late payments. But so far, we're not seeing it in anything outside the norms. And you saw that in our overall performance being the only one to reduce overall churn to just 0.888. Eight points less than year ago because people, when they come to T-Mobile, they're finding what they're looking for. Mike, you mentioned that consumers are anxious. These are strange times going into your end. You seeing them trade down on what packages they spend for T-Mobile? No. But we are seeing a potential flight to value from other providers. And our competitors, our principal competitors, jacked big price increases under their customers this summer. While those customers were locked in device repayment plans and could do nothing about it, where we reiterated price lock. The fact that when you come to T-Mobile, only you can change your plan. It's the uncontract. We won't change it for you. And that kind of trust that bond we have with our customers is really resonating right now. And it's one of the reasons why this quarter, we attracted more postpaid net additions than AT&T and Verizon combined. The sounds like a classic market share grab. Well, that's our strategy. For years, our principal growth strategy has been to grow our share methodically and through the power of our brand, the fact that we put customers first, that we love them, that we treat them right, we give them low prices. And now, combining that with the leading 5G network, there is a real opportunity for us to resonate with a whole new audience of people that actually never gave us a serious look before. Well, last time I talked to, I think you were still getting the 5G up and running. It was in some spots. What is it now? And how is a different compared to Verizon AT&T? Well, today our broad layer of 5G reaches 97% of Americans. And our ultra-capacity 5G reaches 250 million people. If you asked for a comparison, that 250 million is where Verizon publicly stated they hope to be two years from now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,11,2022-10-28 14:33:37
4311," million people. If you asked for a comparison, that 250 million is where Verizon publicly stated they hope to be two years from now. Where do you see what's the next level of 5G? Where else does it roll out and what else you work on? Well, one of the things is putting it to work are all kinds of new use cases. Magenta Max, which is our most popular rate plan. It's actually one of our higher end rate plans, happens to be our most popular because it's the best expression of that 5G network. Truly unlimited usage on our network and customers are using it like never before. But also home broadband. Customers are using our 5G to power the internet in their entire home and they're tearing out cable and fiber to do it because we charge them $50 and zero cents. Our net ads and home broadband on 5G were more than the net ads on broadband for AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined. Did you leave anyone out? Well, you know, it's interesting. You know, we're comparing ourselves to everyone in the industry and what we're really interested in are net promoters scores, whether or not when those people come to us, whether they like what they have, where 30 points higher than cable and our net promoters scores are even higher than fiber. You also raised the, and we've had this discussion the past, the amount of synergies from the sprint transaction, where are these synergies coming from and where's their, when does it peak out? Well, the principle place they come from is the network and we achieved a massive milestone in Q3, the substantial shutdown of the entirety of the sprint network targeted sites. So that is behind us now into the run rate synergies we increased in our guidance yet again as a result because that network shutdown happened more than a year ahead of schedule. There's still some room to run into next year, but as we finished 2022, most of those run rate synergies are now in the run rate. Every analyst I talked to on the street, Mike, they mentioned T-Mobile is about ready to do a large share buyback. Someone I talked to highlighted $60 billion potential from 2023 to 2025. Are you still on that track? Well, that's what we said in our 2021 analyst day. And yeah, you know, our cash flow production has continued to come in in line with expectations ever since then. And so not only did we get that program started with a $14 billion buyback, but we started it early. And so in 2022, we're actively buying right now with a $3 billion program this year and an $11 billion program in 2023. And that's an expression of the confidence of our management and our board in the future. Before you let you go, speaking of confidence, you struck an upbeat tone on the metaverse on your earnings call. Now, it was a tough day for meta stock at slam tough quarter, you know, a lot of focus on the metaverse on what it may be and what it may not be. How do you see it? Is it a big deal? Do you care about it? We do and it's not all about one company either, even though they renamed their name to meta. It's about every company starting to live in the digital 3D world. You know, I just came from a CEO conference last week where I heard all kinds of companies making digital twins in manufacturing environments and training their employees in the metaverse while they're producing their actual factories so that employees can walk into that factory when the doors open. Having lived in its digital twin for weeks during training. That's metaverse. So applications are here today in the enterprise and in the consumer side in gaming that are 3D digital imagery. And that's fundamentally what the metaverse is all about and it requires massive connectivity and low latency exactly what T-Mobile's unique 5G network delivers. So that's my last question. How does T-Mobile make money off the metaverse? Is it through charging consumers in businesses? Well, a few ways. One is our most popular plan right now. Magenta Max also happens to be one of our higher end plans. So customers, unlike slamming them with price increases like our competitors, our customers are self-selecting up our rate card to get access to more and more of what we offer. That's a win for us, but it's also a win for them because it's the best expression of the best 5G network. I felt Mike's comments on the metaverse were very interesting and maybe adds another red flag to what meta is building out.

4312," dollars to roll out this metaverse and other companies could probably make money off it. And it has nothing per se necessarily to do with what Meta's doing. Right. It has a larger implication around the technology that's actually going to be used, the hardware that's going to be necessary for the metaverse. Is it hardware that we already have? Is it an app-based solution like Roblox? Or is it actually via a VR headset? And it comes back down to what the consumer wants in that experience. If you asked that to Bill McDermott, actually we did yesterday. And he believes that, yeah, there's opportunity for the metaverse. All the companies are saying the same thing I might add to where, of course, Mike was just saying, and it runs on us. And Bill was saying, and service now will be there. There's this larger question of the user experience and what that will be from watching a fashion show or watching a concert in the metaverse all the way through to conversion and shopping activity that could also take place. And all the digital twin stuff, which is something that Nvidia has talked about as well, because there's lots of applications on the chip side too. I mean, do you think the other companies are a little annoyed with meta for naming itself meta when they're all also in the metaverse business? Maybe. Oh, we actually, we have to get our producer-conner to string all these comments together on the metaverse. We got a mental no-furniture conner. I know you're listening in, so just. Can I ask you one more thing, though, sauce? When T-Mobile touts itself is having improved its network and is stealing customers from the others, for a while, they're re-reliant. And we are still seeing it to some extent. This real promotion wars between the telecom companies. It's costing them, though. I mean, in the case of T-Mobile, what does its outlay look like? What are its margins look like right now as it is trying to get those new customers to join, because it's trying to offer that value proposition. Well, they've been the only telecom, I would say, over the past year and a half, to consistently raise their profit outlook, because their revenue continues to come up to the upside. And they also continue to see billions in dollars of cost takeout or their reducing costs in those legacy sprint assets. That's what we heard from T-Mobile last night. They see almost $3 billion of cost-cutting in those legacy sprint operations coming into the year. Maybe they were around $2 billion or so. I mean, that's huge upside for this company. All right. Coming up on the other side. Memes stock media, huh? Oh, yeah. The partners Bob Sloan will give us this take on volatile stocks next. Right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,13,2022-10-28 14:42:34
4313," McConnell resources cut off again on Tuesday. The number Well, look here we got stocks at the highs of this session. The SME 500 now up about 1.2% to dial up some 500 points. The NASHEC, though, probably the real surprise here, given the big disappointment from Amazon in particular that it's managing to eke out again. And something else perhaps surprising here is that as we have seen stocks on the rise, guess what? They're selling in bonds. That's not something that we have seen too much this year. They have mostly been moving in tandem, not selling, by the way, pushing the yields up higher a little bit here to nearly 4% on the 10-year yield. So kind of interesting that what we had been seeing, now we have been seeing stocks go up and yields go down this week, so buying in both on the weekly basis. But today they have reasserted their traditional relationship as it were. I was just talking about the NASHEC and how surprising it is with Amazon down by 9%. But if you take a look at the equal weight NASHEC 100 here, most of the components are in the green. We've got Apple, of course, that is certainly helping matters. It's at its highs of the session now up by nearly 7% after what looked like an initially mixed quarter and was a mixed quarter. But it looks like investors are looking at the bright side here this morning when it comes to those shares. Let's also talk about some of the stocks that we were talking about a lot more earlier in the year. We're talking about meme stocks. Our next guest was one of the few who saw last year's short squeeze of GameStop coming before it happened. And with this company's data analytics can help investors avoid surprises from market structure and hopefully find the next big short squeeze from where we welcome in Bob Sloan, S3 partners, CEO and managing partner. Bob, thanks for being here. And just because a company has high short interest doesn't mean there's going to be a squeeze. But what are some of the conditions, if you will, that make a company or a sector or a collection of companies right for action like that? That's a terrific question. The main ingredient to a short squeeze is not the flawed short interest that you will see published on Google. The main ingredient of a short squeeze is how much or short sellers losing and what's the upward momentum price action of the stock. As they lose more money and you see the price action go higher, that is what causes a short squeeze. That is what S3 calculates and that's why we're one of the most popular data sets in the world when it comes to measuring short interest flow and financing rates. Is there enough short activity right now or short volume or float that's in the market right now to cause anything near the type of scale that we saw at the beginning of 2021? If you look at GME, I think there's still a billion to short in the stock. If the stock goes past $30, you could see something in Parabolic. Bob, I would say one of the conditions for the high to the meme stock rally. A lot of people were home during the COVID pandemic. We get a recession next year. Do you think that sets the condition for increased trading activity? One of the things that I mentioned on the Netflix special that was done on GameStop, a lot of people have seen that, is this idea of Kardashian economics. If you think, if you look at the arc, the Kardashians are still here. If you look at the arc of that, apply it to socially mobilized investing and think that's going to go away. I don't think so. Okay. For some of the other industries that are further outbats and based on some of the more innovative technology, there's been more of the, how can we say, the arc trade, if you will? How do you look at some of the sector based or even the innovation based trades right now and considering that there's an alternative trade to even that in the short positions that have flown in?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,14,2022-10-28 14:46:36
4314," at some of the sector-based or even the innovation-based trades right now and considering that there's an alternative trade to even that in the short positions that have flowed in. So there's also selling along positions, which is you could argue that the equivalent of a short position. And one of the things that we have is a new product is looking at market structure and particularly on the long side. And if you look at our new product, you'll see that meta is the second most popular holding amongst the hedge fund community. What will that do in returns over the next quarter? I think we know the answer already. So those types of stocks, when you see persistency and holding over time and you see a down draft in the marketplace, you're going to see losses. And that will affect where money moves, it affects how different strategies are composed. And one of the things that really caught our attention was when Dave and I, Horne came out and said value investing is dead. You know, for us, that's like a profit coming down from the mountain and throwing away the tablets. You know, it's just heresy, right? So, but what he's saying is that markets evolve, market structure is very important and it's not just the short side. It's the long side too and our new product's all for that. Bob, I want to go back to what you just said about meta. I see Amazon is also one of the most has the most long positions next to meta. Spelled that out for us a little bit more. What you were alluding to that even after that sharp decline, the 25% drop in meta on a single day basis, even after the 10% or so drop that we're seeing in Amazon today, is what you're saying? Does that imply that we could see more people get caught holding the bag and more selling exacerbated going forward? Yes, that's exactly what we're saying. Persistency of long positions, quarter of a quarter are quite high, so it is reasonable to assume that since if you look at the hedge fund cohort and see what the largest holdings are, it is very reasonable assume that there are severe losses in portfolios today right now as we speak. Bob, thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. We really appreciate breaking it down and looking through some of the data that you're also tracking. Thank you very much. Absolutely. Guys, coming up, we're going to take a deeper dive into some more earnings reports from Deckers. We've got Colgate, Palm Olive and Gilea, Science is exciting. That's nice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,15,2022-10-28 14:50:58
4315,"upbeat music playing Welcome back everyone. This is a short story. We start with this today. We are watching Deckers Outdoor after it released a conservative forecast alongside earnings the footwear maker which owns brands like UG Boots, Hoka, seeing its stock move despite a quarterly profit beat. They're taking a look at shares down a little more than 5% right now. They said in this quarter that net sales actually increased 21.3% compared to last year, and then additionally in their wholesale net sales, that actually increased by about 16.7% here as well with DTC of 35%. When I saw that sales gain on my, wow, maybe they're trying some new stuff. I went right to the UG page and they have these Moon Boots. I haven't seen stuff like this in a while. 320 dollars a pop but it looks like a new innovation burst over at UG's. No more necessarily those brown shoes and some PSLs and you go out and walk around the hall. I like these. Have you not seen what these shoes looked like before? I mean, brown shoes? They didn't look like this. No, but they look like they have. They have. I was going around. I mean, I go back to high school. Yeah, but they've been, they've already invaded. Well, I think we're always really interested. And the Hoka brand has been on fire for them, right? It's not just about UG's Hoka net sales approaching that of UG's $333 million for Hoka $476.5 million for UG. So they're getting up there here. It does seem really the discipline was from that they did not raise their expectations. All right, sticking with earnings, Colgate, Palmolve. Pan by investors after the consumer package goods company poured a sales miss despite raising prices. This is inflation and a cloud of economic outlook continue. Probably one of the more disappointing quarters from consumer package goods company. But still, another company I think is doing some pretty innovative things. The crest, not the crest, the Colgate whitening pen. Overnight whitening pen, it just works. I tried to resell it. It just works. Yeah. All right, I gave me one of those. So, is it just like whitening at the same time? And then you sleep with it. You sleep a little while to get used to it. And the short day there. Just take your teeth. Yeah, very healthy. Yeah. I'm sure. I mean, it comes down to how they're moving inventory continuously into some of the storefronts that are the most massive retailers as well, Target, Walmart. And where consumers are also leaning into some of those household name brands versus perhaps trying out some of even in the trade down, trying out some of the homegrown brands that are Target or Walmart brand. But the difference here between some of the other consumer brand companies we've heard from, like the Proctor and Gamble's, the world is they raised prices enough to offset any volume declines or if not to clients and volume slow down. And that doesn't seem to have succeeded enough to the same extent in Colgate, Palm Olive. So, one other company to discuss in our little earnings round up here is Gilead, the drug maker. It is moving to the upside 10% after reporting better than expected profit from demand for its HIV and cancer drugs, that offset lower sales of the pharmaceuticals COVID-19 anti-viral drug as well as acquisition costs. So, this represents a pretty impressive move upward here for Gilead because it's been having some rocky times in terms of its stock performance. Yeah. Big Tarvi putting the team on its back, sales increased 22% year over year, but oncology sales, yeah, 79%. As you were talking about there a moment ago here. And then additionally going forward here for Gilead, given that they had placed so much of the research and development as well in the novel coronavirus pandemic around some of the treatments, it's going to be interesting to see where some of those patents are able to be leveraged into some of the other treatments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,16,2022-10-28 14:55:25
4316," Well, in the novel coronavirus pandemic, around some of the treatments, it's gonna be interesting to see where some of those patents are able to be leveraged into some of the other treatments moving forward to. I was just gonna see a positive reaction to our answer, Paul, and what has been really challenging week, notably in the tech space. Yeah, so this move up where the biggest, it looks like the stock is also the highest in, I'm looking at the one year, it's definitely the highest over the past year, probably the highest going back to about mid 2020 for these Gilead shares here, and actually now on the one year chart, up 15%, interesting here. So as we look at, as we take a step back, take a little breath here after this busy week of earnings, really we have focused a lot on the technology earnings. And so as we look back over the week, it really felt like a tough week that really defied some expectations that some of these big tech firms would be more resilient. I think people expected the bad meta-quarter, but aside from that, I think really Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, all of them really disappointing investors. Yeah, I think investors were shell shocked. And this is the really the second-street quarter for meta that wasn't just disappointing, it was just really, really bad. It's just not good. Any line out in the report, not good. You know, even with this week's earnings that we saw, I'm actually glad that we ended with Gilead Sciences there a moment ago, because if you look at some of the year-to-day performers that have actually not just outpaced the market performance, but actually maintained a positive move over the course of this year, companies like Merck, it's some of the United Health Cares as well that are actually positive over the course of the year. So as much as attention, as much attention as we give big tech, and for a great reason, it's in the palm of our hands, it's on our screens every single day, it's the different devices that we operate with. It still comes back to what are some of the core elements right now in this economy that people are still going to engage with? It's your energy, it's your health, and then it's all of these other products layered on as well, and that's where the real demand equation and the necessity of communication services as referenced through all of our conversations with AT&T, with T-Mobile and as well with Verizon. So I had to play golf tomorrow? I'm so excited to play with you guys. Me, you Dave Briggs, Senior Communist Rigduman, we're in the links. Let's pump, pump. I was looking at the interactive. Oh, I didn't know. There's a lot of green on there too. Yeah, it's a lot of green. Yeah, I was looking at the... I was looking at the drug stock that you were just talking about. See, there you have it, the year-to-date drug action here, Giliad among them, of 6.8% in the year, Eli Lilly, of 30.8% here. So that was really interesting too. I was also looking at the sectors on the week here, communication services, right? That's the big loser. That includes a meta consumer staples, XLP in the upper left there, up 5.9%. So interesting, the weekly action that we have seen. Report, report of the week for me, I'll just quickly add McDonald's. Oh, wow. What a quote of opinion. What a quote of opinion. Donald's coming off October tracking up close to 20% all because these adult happy meals. Wow, big, big, big. Yeah, between McDonald's and Chipotle, we got the food space covered, different consumers as well, that they're going after. All right, we gotta go, you guys. Oh, I think we've already. I keep going for Gina and that sprays are gonna do a deeper dive into those earnings from Apple which cities Jim Suva that's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,17,2022-10-28 14:59:43
4317,". Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita, along with MS for right. Here's what we're watching at this hour. Twitter takeover, Elon Musk officially taking ownership of the social media platform and fiery top executives right along the way here. Is the saga really over? We're going to discuss in just a bit. It's a tale of two mega caps, Apple extending its streak of earnings beats, the company posting record revenue, even as iPhone sales came in lighter than expected, but a different story for Amazon as the e-commerce show prepares to quote, tighten its belt after disappointing results. And we are all about energy on this Friday. The earnings parade continues with oil giants Chevron and Exxon breaking in record profits and higher energy prices. We're going to break down those results and then continue our energy chat. We're talking specifically green energy with plug powers, chief executive about alternative solutions. First, let's check in on the market action. Things looking good so far. 90 minutes into the trading day with the Dow up 622 points. Take a look at that. Up nearly 2% looking to extend its streak of wins to four straight weeks. The S&P 500 up 62 and the NASDAQ up 193 there despite some of those disappointing results we're talking about coming through this week. Well, the big story of the morning Elon Musk is officially taking control of Twitter, bringing his $44 billion takeover of the social media giant, tweeting out the bird is freed to mark the start of his ownership of a company. And that start reportedly includes several executives such as CEO Parag Aguahal and CFO Ned Seagal being let go joining us to discuss this. Yeah, who finances Alexis Keenan and Alex. Let's start with the shakeups here that have happened already. Not entirely unexpected. Right. But what does this look like moving forward? We're taking a look at the potential payouts that could come. What this could mean for the company. Yes. So these top executives so far are entitled to compensation under the merger agreement. They get accelerated compensation. So there's a big pay day here. Let's go through what those are CEO Parag Aguahal and CFO Ned Seagal also being let go. Head of legal policy, Vijaya Gadi. She's the one who is controversial for banning President Trump also banning political ads on Twitter and also had banned that New York post story saying that Hunter Biden had arranged a meeting between his father and Ukrainian businessmen. So these big shifts, they're going to cost the company some money. I've read up to $200 million. The numbers are a little bit shaky. But we do know that those three executives get together. They own 1.2 million shares in Twitter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,18,2022-10-28 15:03:59
4318," Some money. I've read up to $200 million. The numbers are a little bit shaky. But we do know that those three executives together, they own 1.2 million shares in Twitter. We're $65 million. Also under the merger agreement, a golden parachute for accelerated investing of stock worth $119.6 million. They also get one year of salary and benefits. Each of those executives making $600,000 a year plus base salary. So big ticket items here. And now it's interesting that the big executives, they're out, but we don't feel that sorry for maybe the big ones again, a bit of a payout there. But what about the employees? Because there had been, had lines that 75% of the employees were going to be cut. Then Elon Musk says, no. So what happens to the employees, the majority of them at Twitter? So there are reports that Elon Musk did, in fact, this is the New York Times saying that he did, in fact, agree to pay the investing that was coming for the rank and file employees. Now that date is November 1st. So Tuesday, a big part of Twitter's workforce was set for a big payday. Estimates are that that payment, if Musk does make it, will cost approximately $100 million. And there's some concern. Some employees have expressed concern that he won't, in fact, make those payments because under the language of the agreement, going back to the merger agreement language again, it says that you have to still be employed at the company in order to get those payouts. So that's something to watch. Also- That's a financial two-fire then, right? Yeah, it absolutely does. And look, Twitter's ranks have swelled to 7,500 employees between 2020 and 2021. That was the year-end number as of December. And so the company has been adding and adding to its workforce over the past five years, certainly with that incentive, it might be something that he wants to take a close look at, getting rid of more employees. And finally, there are questions here about what this business structure is going to look like. I mean, Elon Musk has floated a number of ideas since this offer was first made back in April of this year, subscription model, you know, sort of getting rid of a number of features. At the end of the day, the business as it stands gets more than 80% of its revenue from add dollars. So what's going to change there? Yeah, so TBD, right? But what we can know is what was tweeted between Elon Musk and his associates, some of them being friends, some of them business partners, investors, in the tweets that we saw, his personal treats that we got through the litigation in discovery that was supposed to happen with Twitter if this yield didn't go through. He had talked a lot about, you know, shifting users also the amount of content, the type of content that would be permitted on the platform. So certainly, we can expect some more wide-ranging speech allowed on the platform. That's something that he has long said he wants to do. He also says he wants to be able to have it as a forum that does that without inciting violence. Also, that tweet that he tweeted out directly to his advertisers yesterday, he said this, Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape or anything can be said with no consequences. He went on to say that he aspires to make it one of the most respected advertising platforms in the world. So definitely giving a nod to the fact that just anything can't go on Twitter. TBD, as usual, with has been with this deal with Trenar, thanks so much Alexis Keenan. And let's turn now to the latest round of big tech earnings, starting with Amazon shares, taking a head following a revenue miss in its latest quarter, and weaker than expected results from its Amazon Web Services segment. Amazon also forecasting lackluster fourth quarter revenue, which it doesn't bode well for the holiday shopping period. And this is something interesting that we've watched with Amazon, right? AWS, a little bit lighter than expected. Also, warning about that slowdown, that is significant. A slowdown with consumers going into the holiday season, where the sales expected to grow from 2 to 8%, but that's the lowest in the company in these history. I think that it's important to pay attention to what Amazon is saying about the health of the consumer as we go into the fourth quarter. Yeah, I mean, you could argue that forecast is really what weighed on the stock yesterday. We saw it down significantly after the results, after the bell, falling below that $1 trillion mark, which is pretty incredible when you think about a company that has grown so quickly and significantly, especially during the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,19,2022-10-28 15:08:16
4319," Well, it's after the bell, falling below that $1 trillion mark, which is pretty incredible when you think about a company that has grown so quickly and significantly, especially during the pandemic. A few comments to know here, I mean, you talked about the slowdown that's expected in the holiday quarter. Obviously, if you're an investor perspective, a little concerning when you think that's supposed to be one of the strongest times of year. CFO Brian Olsavsky, saying the company is taking steps in his words, tighten its belts that includes pulling back on cat-backs, pausing, hiring in some businesses, winding down some products and services. So when you think about where Amazon has been since the pandemic began, it really has been about grow, grow, grow, adding more staffing, you know, adding or expanding other facilities and all that. And it feels like things might slow down a bit there, take a bit of a pause because of what they're seeing, especially on their e-commerce side of things. And which is what also we have seen with other companies related to tech as well, where they just take a pause, perhaps a pause with hiring, a pause with perhaps more investments. Also just want to note, Amazon still has 55 buy ratings and two hold one sell. So you have a lot of analysts that have lowered their price target on this stock, but you still have analysts that consider it a buy. Yeah, and when you look at $101, a lot of people may be saying, well, considering where it's been trading, that may not actually be a bad price to get in on. On a more upbeat note, Apple shares are trading higher after a top estimates for the fourth quarter. But future guidance for the December quarter, looking dim as Apple expects a deceleration in year over year revenue. And this is one of those things. And as when you think about what preceded these results, you know, Apple did just well enough to sort of add some optimism to investors, we're a little concerned about things. But when you think about iPhone sales, I mean, the company touted new revenue records for the quarter in iPhone services, wearables, home accessories, but they didn't come in a little softer than what is expected. iPhone revenue up 10% year on year. No surprise here, something we were trying to fly yesterday. The dollar strength, a significant headwind for the company. They did fly that yet again, saying in the September quarter revenue was up 8%, but the company faced 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. And that's another thing to continue watching as we see the dollar strength. Yeah. But other companies, multinationals have also talked about is that dollar strength. But what I found also interesting with the other products category, including Apple Watch AirPods, that saw increases that beat Wall Street expectations. But it'll be interesting to see what happens with these types of products if consumers pull back on discretionary spending on these products that may not be as necessary, let's say, as if they were to need an iPhone. Let's bring in another voice into the conversation. You've got Jim Subaz, city managing director and equity research specializing in technology. Jim gets a talk to you. Let's try to move the conversation forward because we are in that quarter where Apple traditionally has done, has seen the most strength, especially during the holidays. Based on what you heard yesterday, how optimistic are you about what they're likely to see in this quarter, especially with consumers being weighed down by higher prices? Well, Akeko, it's great to see you again, my friend. I got to tell you that's a very smart question. As we approach the holidays, there's a little bit of a headwind happening here of consumers have less discretionary income. Their rent is more expensive, gasoline prices are more expensive, more and more things are expensive. And so we are also seeing a challenge with foreign exchange. When you translate those dollars from the pound or the euro or the yen back to US dollar, it's a big headwind of about 10% to Apple. That being said, we still do expect growth next quarter, probably in the neighborhood of about 4% a year over year growth. Now that seems a little subdued, but when you have 10% of your sale or 10% of your growth being taken away by FX, you add that back. That's actually 14% growth year over year. That's remarkable in this situation, especially in a world where a lot of megatech right now is seeing a lot of pressure. We're very positive on Apple, we think that the platform continues to grow and a lot of new and exciting things in the future, I think. And Jim, speaking of the consumer, what about the other products? What about Apple Watch? What about AirPods? Apple market market market market targetickenSPZF7, ROGT T才 app,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,20,2022-10-28 15:12:42
4320," And Jim, speaking of the consumer, what about the other products? What about Apple Watch? What about AirPods? Those expectations. But if we go into a recession, if the consumer pulls back on discretionary items, are you going to see some weakness there? So Annas, that's a good observation point. But I got to point out that when people break their iPhone, they find a way to replace them. They may reduce the amount that they're spending on food and beverage or delay some clothing purchases. But Annas, I can also tell you that people will replace their iPhones. Also remember, Apple payters to the part of the market that is not necessarily the emerging markets where people are living a lot more frugal lifestyle. They tend to cater to a people who want a premium experience. And it's worth that software and hardware come together in a wonderful experience that people are willing to pay and premium for it. So Apple would not be immune, but what they do have is a tremendous amount of cash flow where they could buy back a lot of stock. And we're seeing that other tech companies, if we enter a big downturn, they don't have the cash flow generation that Apple does. So you've got a valuation support that could help out Apple should things get really bad next year and were positive on the stock. Getting a positive, you've got a price target of $175 a share, we're just under that right. Now I think I saw 156 there. What do you think is going to be the big catalyst that gets you there? And the other question we haven't really tackled yet, how big of a weight will China be as we see things slowing down over there? Well, some of the big catalysts we see is a foldable iPhone or iPad in 2024. But next year's 2023, the people will be looking forward next year to the following year and that will start to get people pretty excited. Also the services, we believe that their services are going to start to accelerate in 2023 as we lap these difficult foreign exchange comparisons and as they put in price increases it should help them. So we actually do see these as positive catalyst for 2023, foldable phones in 2024 and a platform that's growing. You'd mentioned I Apple Watch. That's very important. Now people are using it more and more in healthcare. We expect that to continue to grow. We see them getting more and more involved with the enterprise. Simply put, the platform of Apple, which we view Apple as a platform company, not just a hardware company, continues to expand and grow its addressable market. We see a lot of positive things ahead for the company. Yeah, a lot more tentacles there allowing the company to pull some levers. From Souvab, as always, great to have you on. City managing director and equity research specializing in technology. Well, another tech stock we're watching this morning, cost reductions at Intel are helping lift the stock today. It's up more than 10%. This coming despite slumping sales on Q3 and disappointing guidance. The chipmaker saw revenue decline 20% to $15.3 billion in the most recent quarter as demand for PC's softened. The company now expects a revenue of 14 to $15 billion in the current quarter that is the low wall street estimates. But it did pledge to slash costs aggressively throughout layoffs and through slower spending on new plans, Intel's now aiming to reduce costs by $3 billion next year, adding up to an annual savings of $10 billion by the end of 2025 and that helping lift the stock today up 10%.

4321," What can we do with theiano Let's take a quick look at the markets this morning with personal consumption expenditures data out this morning. That metric closely watched by the Fed here with more Yahoo finances, Jared Blyckery, Jared. Yes, I'm ashamed. I didn't get the memo. No pink on me. Let's get to the markets here. I want to check the S&P 500 futures here because I'm going to talk about the inflation readings we got this morning, some of the economic data. Here was that 830 release. We got a brief spike up and retracement. But then it was off to the races. Was it because of the below then expected reading an inflation, probably not other things that play here. But I do want to point out the currency situation. US dollar is advancing once again. This is intraday. We've got this on a three month basis. You can see this is a second day of gains evidenced by these two green candlesticks here. We are hovering by what are 20 year highs here, basically going back to 2001. You put a max chart, basically going back to this area here where we saw a 120 high in the DXY. Now, composed of this, we have the US dollar advancing again with respect to the Japanese. That comes on the heels of the rate decision where they largely stood, stood, pat here. Getting big, no big surprises. But this was the intervention that we got last Friday. You can see barely having extended. We are still at the bottom of that range. Now, when we had this before in September, in two weeks, we were right back up there. So I don't think any of these pressures have ease. We got to look to the calendar next week because we do have an FOMC decision. That's going to come out next Wednesday. After that, we have the labor market. We have non-farm payrolls on Friday. That's a big monthly report. A couple of weeks after that, we got CPI. So these are the big things that are moving the market right now. And I haven't even touched on the mega cap earnings, which are also in view here. But I do want to end on something that's affected by currencies. That's the dollar. Excuse me. That is crude oil here. And WTI, you can see, is down about 1.5%. We do have Exxon mobile earnings and Chevron earnings looking at almost record profits for both Exxon. Definitely the case there. We're going to talk about that in a second, guys. Yeah. Thank you so much for that Jerry Chevron, and Exxon as Jerry reported or mentioned, reported earnings this morning.

4322," at in a second, guys. Yeah, let's pick up right there. Thanks so much for that Jared Chevron. And Exxon has Jared reported or mentioned reported earnings this morning. And it's no surprise here. The world's largest oil companies crushed analyst expectations. Exxon posted almost $20 billion in profit. That is the best result ever for the company. Rival Chevron reported its second largest profit amid increased demand for natural gas. Joining us now to discuss these results is for us managing director for energy research, Neil Dingman. You know, Neil, I feel like every quarter we're saying are we at peak oil? And here we are talking about record profits again. Is this as good as it gets? No, if you simply answer is no. I mean, to call these companies cash cows is probably an understatement. I think I'd call them cash bulls. You all mentioned the earnings of the profit. We simply, I think the big factor being free cash flow. Chevron had a new quarterly record, almost $11 billion in free cash flow. Exxon was just a touch under its record last quarter, still generate over $17 billion in free cash flow. And what's unique about these companies is that they're good in the majority of this from the upstream while having some growth unlike most of my independence that are basically seen no growth. And Neil, this energy crunch that we've seen, so many people talk about it as being something really structural that this is going to go on for years, and countries trying to figure out where they're getting their energy from. So if this continues like this, are we going to be seeing more gains for these companies? Yes, I think especially for these diversified these companies that are not just purely domestic, like obviously the two majors, that if they can open up Exxon, talked about a new, just a recommend of new LNG production. They're talking about, they talked about new carbon ventures. There's just a lot of things that they're gonna start doing that again, my smaller companies are not gonna be afforded to as they sort of keep production flat, but the simple answer I think is absolutely that. They will try to expand, but the simple answer is domestically as international, especially Europe, the supply is just when it comes to infrastructure is simply too tight. So that not the upstream is gonna remain the challenge, the midstream. And Neil, it's worth pointing out this number that I thought was pretty incredible here. Exxon in this current quarter is forecast to post full your profit in excess of $50 billion. So if you look at that, that's more than Amazon, Proctor, and Gamble, and Tesla combined. Right, I mean, what a difference a few years makes when you think about where Exxon was before. This is a company and not just Exxon, but Chevron too, obviously that is exposed to these cyclical swings. And obviously they have had a huge year, but when you think about where they're putting their money, you talked about some investments, they're also reiterating their share buyback. I mean, is that a smart use of money when you think about where the lows have been for these oil giants and how far they've had to climb back up? Right, I think the simple answer is they have two choices. You can either expend it externally or as you said, either some sort of share all the return. And most of them even including the majors just say, okay, what would it cost me to go by anything on the upstream, midstream infrastructure, new venture side and on an asset value, what are my shares still trade for? As you said, even with all of the shares, like Exxon are basically at an all time high, the simple answer is still a lot of them that their shares are still trading at a significant discount on an asset value. So I still think it does. They're, let me say though, they're not buying back near as much shares and paying near as much dividends as some of the independents, which are paying upwards of 75, 85 and 90% of their free cash flow out. So the majors do keep a much more optionality to do other things. And Neil, Kiko mentioned how these companies have really had to climb from the lows. I mean, back in 2020, you had oil negative. And it's hard to imagine that Chevron Exxon mobile now have a bigger market cap than Meta. So right now we're watching year-to-date Exxon mobile is up 78%, Chevron's up 52% year-to-date. If investors didn't get into the stock earlier this year, is it too late or how do you see this in the next three to six months, especially if the economy goes into a recession? Simplons, no, it's not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,23,2022-10-28 15:25:36
4323," Lane or how do you see this in the next three to six months, especially if the economy goes into every session? Simponsors, no, it's not too late. And why I say that is I've been talking to a lot of investors. And to me, out on the street right now, the biggest variable or the biggest sort of, you know, when you're looking at stocks, I think is free cash flow yield. And right now the energy group, even these two stocks today dominate all their sector. I think right now in the S&P 500 of the top 10 stocks in the five end that seven are EMP companies as far as having the highest free cash flow yield. So I'm definitely aware of the run that all of them had even Chevron X on included. But again, to me, it comes down to what the free cash flow yield, what you're able to do with that. And right now the energy sector still dominates all other sectors in that aspect. Sure as managing director for research or energy research Neil Dingman gets a talk to you on this Friday. Well, coming up with the Fed expected to raise rates again next week, we'll move to a global recession. And how can investors position their portfolios in a world of 5% interest rates?

4324," percent by March of 2023. Joining us is a discuss further. We've got Brian Relling, Wells Fargo Investment Institute, head of Global Fixed Income Strategy. I'm good to have you in studio today. It feels like the 75 basis points is largely baked in for next week. The question is what happens come to summer? Yeah, that's the big question in the market. And I think it's 50-50 come to summer, whether they stay with 75 or they downshift to 50. I don't think the fed's going to commit one way or the other next week. It's really going to come down to that data post-fed meeting, both the jobs report and most importantly the inflation data we get around mid-November. Talk to us a little bit about we were talking during the break. Some concerns about liquidity in the bond market, which I've been following as far as the dollar has gotten higher, so it has risen, even though it's pulled back a little bit. Other countries perhaps not buying as many U.S. Treasuries or selling their treasuries to back their currencies. So is this a concern that you're watching? It is a concern. Both were seeing, as you mentioned, the impact of other central banks, but also our own central bank doing their quantitative tightening, bringing liquidity out of the market. And it's becoming more and more over time, right? So it takes its toll. But liquidity typically isn't a problem until it is a problem. So I think the fed will take the steps necessary to make sure the gears continue to run. So if there is just a complete liquidity drain somewhere, I think we can count on the fed to step in and make sure things at least function properly. But yes, it is a concern, something we're watching pretty closely. And we've seen it at times in the high yield market. There was a short period of time where deals were having difficulty getting sold. As you mentioned, we've seen it other pockets, other places. But it's nothing at this point that's overly alarming, but there are some things to watch out for there, yes. What are that suggests in terms of where you think treasure yields are likely to move? The 10-year yield now below 4%, we've seen a bit of a pull back there. I mean, what do you expect it to go? Yep, so I expect that we're kind of in a process here over the next month or two as we wait for the fed to downshift where rates are probably hitting their highest levels that we're going to see. Have we hit the highs yet? It's hard to say for sure, but I do think we're going to hit them if we haven't already at some point over the next month or two. So I do think this is a time for investors to think about maybe locking in some of these rates for a longer period of time. As eventually, we head into a recession inflation, moderates, I think we'll get to a point where rates start coming down. So locking some of those levels in now could be attractive over an intermediate term. And which treasures would you say? The longer term, right? So, you know, we've had a lot of investors. There's been a lot of focus on the short end because there's been so much yield there. We haven't seen for a long time, but I would start moving some of that longer. You know, start to buy some 7, 8, 9, 10, maybe even longer. Maturity is just to lock in these rates because I do think as we move into a recession inflation comes down that these rates will look attractive over, like I said, an intermediate time period. Thank you so much, Brian Relling, Wells Fargo Investment Institute, head of Global Fixed Income Strategy. Thanks for joining us. Yeah, thanks for having me. And the birds freed or so says Elon Musk, who is now officially in charge of Twitter, but is the Musk Twitter saga really over? We'll get one expert takeaways on the other side",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,25,2022-10-28 15:34:13
4325," Music Music Music The Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter now sinking in his first order of business cleaning house. The new Twitter owner reportedly fired four top executives including CEO Parag Agrawal Meanwhile, Twitter stock is suspended and an official delisting is set for Tuesday. What's next for the company and its investors? Columbia University's professor of law Eric Talley joins us now to weigh in. Professor Talley, this has been a saga to say the least. What do you think is Elon Musk's first order of business challenge as he takes remains of this company? Well, he's got a cash flow problem he eventually has to solve. His probably first challenge is sort of a big meet and greet. Remember, he spent six months being sort of an adversary to everyone at Twitter, sometimes scaring away employees. And a lot of the employees right now are pretty unsure whether they're even going to have a job next week. So I think that's probably the first mission of damage control or mitigation. But ultimately, he's got to turn this company into a little bit more of a revenue generating entity. Let's talk about that potential of cuts at Twitter because there were reports last week that he could potentially cut 75% of the workforce. Obviously, Elon Musk came out and walked that back. But there is a financial calculation that's happening here, right? I mean, he has just taken over this company as you point out that it struggled. We had our legal reporter, Alexis Keenan, on earlier saying in some ways, it benefits Twitter to fire employees because then you don't necessarily have to pay out the stock compensation that's not bested. Can you kind of break that down for us? Yeah, the employees at Twitter, just like many of the senior executives, have some of their compensation in terms of stock and bonuses and options and so forth. There is a coming payment for many of the employees that's coming next week. And some have speculated, and I'm relatively confident, at least it's a conversation on the table as to whether if there's going to be a reduction in staff, it would predate the data which that payment has to be made. It's a little perilous, however, because while the courts in California will let you let go of at will employees, if you do so, merely to avoid having to pay them compensation for services already rendered, that can be a problem. So there is a little bit of a legal sticking point here as well as a morale sticking point. You don't necessarily want to hand the pink slips to a bunch of your employees while simultaneously stiffing them. That's not going to leave behind a lot of happy campers. I'm wondering if Elon Musk has put himself between a rock and a hard place when it comes to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,26,2022-10-28 15:38:39
4326," I'm not going to leave behind a lot of happy campers. I'm wondering if Elon Musk has put himself between a rock and a hard place when it comes to this Twitter acquisition, basically, or buying this company. And because of this, if Twitter, for example, which is blocked in China, he has Tesla, which operates in China. If a country doesn't like what's being said on Twitter, is he putting himself in a difficult situation? Well, maybe. I mean, one of the things that is definitely extraordinary about Mr. Moss is that his personality seems to permeate almost everything that he's associated with. Now, it's important to remember that he is not the majority shareholder of Tesla, but he is a significant, the most significant shareholder of Tesla. And even early reports suggest that they are exploring different ways that Twitter and Tesla might be able to cooperate with one another. I think that that's going to be an issue that they're going to have to deal with going forward. One of the ways to do it is simply to try to ring fast fence the two companies away from one another. But once you've moved deliberately into the open global marketplace of ideas, that global marketplace of ideas is also going to be part of your own reputational capital. So it's probably something to be concerned about. I don't think it ever really would have been a deal killer, but part of that's going to hinge on how he makes decisions on what the platform looks like in the next eight to 12 months. How do you ring fence those companies, though? I mean, can you do that so long as Elon Musk is running both if we're talking just Tesla? We haven't even talked about SpaceX, but if he's running Tesla and Twitter? It's a hard thing to do. And that's been an issue that he has faced in a bunch of other companies, not just Tesla and SpaceX, but also the other city beforehand. So it would be a difficult maneuver, but people do it. It is one of the things that sort of corporate structures are reasonably good at accommodating. I have to say I've enjoyed your Twitter thread here that you put out in terms of lessons learned from this. But point number nine, where you say J-Screwed, by the way, clever use of the J-Screw logo, you say there may be more funding games in store, Musk had soon decided to reflote minority public shares with his, as you describe it, fanboys bidding up prices. Talk to me about that scenario. Yeah, there's a couple scenarios that could take place from here, and those are two distinct ones. One is, even though now Twitter, as of today, it's no longer a public company, that doesn't have to be permanently the case. It really is caught up with all of its filings with the SEC. It wouldn't be as big of a lift to try to roll out maybe a small fraction of shares. There are a lot of people out there that just are desperate to own anything that Elon Musk is affiliated with. And so putting out that small fraction of shares couldn't give rise to a pretty good price, which then if you triangulate that against the rest of the stock might generate at least what appears to be a very, very valuable company which would help Elon Musk in raising capital elsewhere. The other thing is that while he's trying to increase revenues, he's definitely going to want to try to decrease costs. And one of those big costs that he's going to be facing is the interest payments that is due to his brand new creditors that helped him finance this purchase. The J Crew reference was really meant to refer to a whole bunch of different companies that in the last five or six years have tried to restructure their debt commitments, often in very aggressive ways, ways that sometimes lead to severe conflict between the companies and their creditors. And this often will happen in a situation after a private equity buyout where there's a lot of leverage or debt that is financed to deal. Elon Musk has said that he doesn't have all the answers regarding what Twitter should look like how it should change the town square that he's described. So how do you see this playing out? How do you see this sort of unfolding because we are living in a very polarized society. Users have been kicked off permanently from Twitter. So how do you see this going forward? Well, it seems to be that there are two planes on which he's going to have to be making decisions. One is just revenue generation, cost minimization and much more sort of work a day. How do you run a business? And that is related to but not identical to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,27,2022-10-28 15:42:52
4327," is just revenue generation, cost minimization, and much more sort of work a day. How do you run a business? And that is related to, but not identical to questions about content moderation. And how do you curate this large global community of people interacting with one another? I think Mr. Muska's signal that he wants to have a very, very big tent and then allow people to sort of self select themselves into virtual communities in a way that sort of allows every flower to bloom. Twitter had that view before. They have run into issues involving incendiary tweets, time and again, and that's what kind of has pushed them into their own current content moderation policies. So it'll be interesting to see whether you can pull that off. Thus far, social media companies have had a difficult time with that. Professor, we just pointed out of the back you have Sonic the Hedgehog sketched on the board. It's a nice touch. I do. My daughter put that on the board five years ago, and I can't bear myself to erase it. So I just have to get a new whiteboard. Yeah, we like it. We like it. It's a nice touch there. Appreciate your time today. Columbia Law School Professor Eric Talley joining us there. Well, coming up after the break, we'll be in our elements. Get it? Elements? As we chat with Fuck Power CEO Annie Marsh, who's in studio about the company's green hydrogen ecosystem strategy and the impact of the Emplacian Reduction Act on the industry. We'll be right back. Thank you. I've taken it for granted. Going green with hydrogen, plug powers on emissions, a tackle energy challenges by building green hydrogen plants to produce 500 tons of liquid hydrogen per day. That's by 2025 and we've got the company CEO Andy Marsh with us in studio today. Good to have you on. Happy Friday. Great to be here, Keiko. Yes, and happy Friday. Yes. And I was thinking back to our last conversation. This was kind of at the height of the concerns around the energy crunch and you were saying you were getting a lot of calls coming in, especially from Europe about how do we invest in this? How do we expand? But so it's then it feels like things have softened a bit. I'm looking at where things have been moving. You've cut hydrogen production forecast. You've abandoned plants for two plants.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,28,2022-10-28 15:47:27
4328," What do we invest in this? How do we expand? But since then, it feels like things have softened a bit. I'm looking at where things have been moving. You've cut hydrogen production forecast. You've abandoned plants for two plants. What's happening right now? I'm going to kind of correct that with the two plants, a key go. One of them I announced previously that we were in a position where we couldn't get enough electricity, so it didn't make sense. The second cost issue. The second one was we actually never announced we were going to do it. But we announced we weren't going to do it. So maybe a little confusing to some of our investors. But when I look at our sales funnel for hydrogen, it's never been larger. We've had some delays in supply chain, but we have not lost any orders. My sales funnel for electrolyzers, which is the device that generates hydrogen. I think it's probably double since the last time we spoke. So I actually don't see this negative. I know how it's been reported, but I don't think it was captured correctly. I don't think we did a good enough job explaining it. And where do you see this demand coming from? I mean, is this because we saw oil going up so high? And now it's pulling back a bit, though. Is there other differences there when we're looking at oil prices fluctuating? So I think long, and you always have to think a little long term here. If you believe people are going to address climate, people like Bloomberg will say 20% of world's energy will come from hydrogen. Important item about hydrogen fuel cells is we create a lot more jobs and batteries. And that makes politicians whether they're fossil fuel politicians or renewable energy politicians alike what we do. And the third one, the national security issues that the warn you, Crame, really has highlighted the importance of us in the free world really dealing with our own energy independence. And all of those three are drivers. The broader conversation that's been happening when you think about renewables or green energy versus fossil fuels, it's sort of been frayed in this context of a trade off. You have one or the other. The reality is, yesterday we got that report from the IEA that suggests that investments have been accelerating. And I wonder what you've been seeing from companies that you've been working with, our corporations for creating this calculation with the slowdown that's happening in the broader economy that maybe we need to pull back on some of these investments to accelerate the transition or are you seeing the opposite? That's an interesting question, a key go. And luckily for many of our applications, we actually help customers save money. So when you think about what we're doing with Amazon and Walmart, Amazon was under a lot of pressure yesterday. But when you bring to the table, not only renewable energy, but it helps you save money in your present operations by making it more efficient, it's a much easier sales pitch. And during these difficult times, saving money does create value. And look, long term, these companies all have goals for 20, 40, 20, 50 to meet their carbon goals. And they're doing it because their consumers want it. And what's been the impact from the inflation reduction act? Have the incentives included in their health these companies maybe move in one direction or the other? Absolutely. If you look at the cost of green hydrogen today, it's a lower than diesel fuel. It's a lower than natural gas because of the inflation reduction act. It also positions a US uniquely to be an exporter of green hydrogen, especially to Europe. So it has been a real boom to this industry. But I also think to our long-term economy. And you had mentioned during the break that you were creating jobs in New York. So are you able to fill those jobs? I mean, we have heard about companies trying to fill jobs. How is that going? So young people actually like working at companies that have a mission. And it makes it much easier to recruit young, talented engineers and some of his old guys actually like working in the future too. So it's actually one of the things I love about Plug.

The World Series kicks off tonight for Major League Baseball. And as Houston Astros gets set to take on the Philadelphia Phillies, we're joined by Yahoo Finance's Josh Schaffer to break down the betting landscape surrounding the full classic. So bring it out for us. Dennis, so a couple interesting trends to watch when we talk about gambling and MLB. And one that I've sort of been focusing on this week is actually a term called micro betting. So you can bet now on every pitch, every at bat. And Baseball really lends itself to that. So I spoke to simple, bad CEO Chris Bellowackel about that and kind of the growth in that market. And listen, some of these numbers, guys, it's pretty crazy. So $262 million were bet on this micro betting concept this year. And that means they were betting on the outcome of a pitch if someone's going to hit the ball or miss the ball or hit a home run. And that handle grew three times over the course of the season. So in September, or sorry, in April, the number was 16.7 million. Then in September, it was 53 million for the monthly handle. So you can see that's kind of how MLB spent a lot of narrative about trying to attract young fans.

This is one way that I think they're kind of successfully doing it. Can we just point out the Philadelphia Phillies? Sorry, this isn't bothering me all week. They couldn't come up with a more original name. Phillies? The fight in Phillies, I can't feel. I thought you were with America here. And Panatics is their mascot. Anyway, I'm rooting for the Phillies in the World Series by the way. Just for the record. You're gonna get some eight male winners. It's not hate. Okay, so let's talk about ticket prices, merchandising. I mean, this is a very fanatic, very loyal fan base. How have we seen that reflected in the lead up to Game 1? So we've used the word fanatic multiple times. Let's talk about the company. We already talked about the massive amount. Right, yeah. And so fanatics released some data on the NLCS actually. And what came out about the NLCS merchandise? In 24 hours, they set a record. They actually passed the 2016 Cubs. This is the most sold merchandise ever for the Philadelphia Phillies. You can really see the boom. And then we were just showing the ticket prices and shows you the difference between a team that's been good and a team that just got good. So Game 1 is in Houston. The Get in Price is $489. Then you turn to Philadelphia and the Get in Price is $743. So almost $300 more. And that's before fees. If you want to go in Philadelphia, you're paying almost $900. And it's a standing-remomy seat. So it's pretty crazy. I don't buy that argument because they've been good. But if you're a dominant team, shouldn't be bringing in the fanbase? Yeah. I mean, I'm from Boston. The tickets are always expensive there. I don't know. Maybe some of the fans are something else. But I don't know. I have the Astros. I mean, they've been good for so long. But I don't know. I feel like ticket prices should be high up. Yeah, no. I don't know. I'll be interesting to see kind of how those move to. I didn't want to touch too many of the records that it might be approaching because we always see. We always see a ticket price as move a ton. What if the Phillies lose both games? Yes. They played a night. They played Saturday. Yeah. They have to take one. Maybe people don't want to go. Okay. Last question. Who are you picking? Oh, see, I'm on the bandwagon. I think the Phillies are going to win. The Phillies are in seven. The Phillies in seven? I take the Phillies in seven. Because it's going to take a while and I don't know how well they're going to play when they go out to Houston, right? Okay. But at home, they've been very good. Okay. Game one tonight. Looking forward to it. Thanks so much for that, Josh. Let's do a final check of the markets.

This is all as investors digest disappointing tech earnings with macro headwinds taking a toll on some corporate results here while US GDP came in better than expected with US economy posting its first period of positive growth for 2022. However, things may not be as good as the appear joining us now we've got John Stalfos who is the Oppenheimer Chief Investment Strategist perhaps we start on some of the earnings that have come through from what you've seen how does that kind of tee up the rest of this earnings season for you. Well, thanks for having me on the show really appreciate it. They're always good to be on Yahoo Finance. First off we'd have to say things are actually better than expected. When we look at double digit returns in terms of gains in the across the board, not across the board, rather in terms of what has been reported thus far with 227 companies out of 500 companies having reported. We've got triple digit earnings growth in energy and double digits in industrials, consumer discretionary, real estate and utilities. Now of course, technology is in the red. You've got financial slightly in the red and both tech and financials are just slightly in the red thus far. What we've got to say is overall in a mixed bag kind of environment what would expect that's what we're getting. I think the effects of higher interest rates beginning to slow the economy that we have economic growth as we just heard in the third quarter. We have a slowing somewhat in terms of the involvement of the consumer, but yet resilience exhibited if not robust. And job growth continues to be remarkably resilient even as some employers who have over hired begin to do layoffs because they just had panic hiring. Hey John, it's Julie here. I'm trying to figure out a side look across the tech landscape now. We have some pretty notable busts, right? Meta obviously today on the consumer and advertising side, but some of the other misses as well. Microsoft enterprise spending was supposed to be holding up better than you have service now, which did really well. Like how are you sort of synthesizing and thinking about the big picture when it comes to technology? Well, when it comes to technology, which happens to be one of our favorite sectors, what we're looking at here is we're looking for, because it's so disfavored, is what we want to look for are the companies that remain profitable, that continue to have good cash flow and pay some kind of a dividend ideally. So it's really where in technology, it's the garbier or the growth at a reasonable price area of technology. We always look for babies that get thrown out with the bathwater here when investors are impatient on a quarter to quarter basis in that area. We continue to like industrial consumer discretionary. We also like financials where we think eventually we'll get a steepening yield curve on a more traditional basis. John, our investors being head-ficked by report, and others I would say like Caterpillar, Julie was talking about in the top of the show where new home sales have come way down. You have Caterpillar really having a strong quarter. This is good as it gets. Well, you know, I think what it has to do when you look at those and by recall the chart you brought up a showed that there was strength in terms of the areas of energy in one particular area.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,32,2022-10-28 16:04:34
4332," When you look at those and by recall the chart you brought up showed that there was strength in terms of the areas of energy in one particular area. I think where there we go. Thank you for showing it. I'm really excited to hear it. Construction. I mean, all of this stuff is, you know, it depends on where you're building and what you're building to meet needs. In terms of residential, you're looking at slowing remarkably modest, really, for where interest rates have jumped from the start of the year in terms of mortgage rates. But still, you know, there is this element of resilience in it because the consumer has more money than anyone would have expected at this point with all these rate hikes. And there's a consistency among businesses to want to have enough employees just in case things pick up. John, how resilient would those business need to be if recession or a real recession felt seen through business results? It's seen through the consumer behavior. Doesn't start until mid 2023 as some economists have been expecting and lasts through what, 2024? Yeah. We just don't see it that darkly. And while we are strategists on my team, we have an economist amongst us. And I've been working with economists. I've been in this business for 39 years. I can't believe it. That is a long time. I didn't start at the age of 12, but it's a long time ago. But my point is when we look at the economic data, what we do find remarkable is that the resilience that's embedded in it, whether it's related to the consumer, where we have seen somewhat of a positive turn around, though modest, in the consumer sentiment. And we just recognize the fact that those jobs numbers are not falling drastically. And again, what we do see when we see these layoffs, it tends to be in areas where the employers were panicking hiring coming out of the pandemic. And as a result of that, we can't help but think that that's quite normal. The economists who are looking for a recession here will have to see the NBER change. It's methodology somewhat, because you need to see jobs really fall, and you need to see the consumer really roll over. And that's just not happening this time. But it likely is, because there are elements in this that were structured, because of what happened with the economy during the pandemic, all the stimulus, the over stimulation. And now a federal reserve that while steepening, it's what the cost of money is actually healthy. It's the end of free money and free money cost speculation. But we don't think it's going to be a draconian kind of effort by the Fed, ultimately. We think it won't be a valker, but we'll look more like a Bernanke. And John, just quickly, then, what are the implications for when the Fed is going to start winding down its current tightening? I think we're going to have to wait for that, Julie. It'll happen sometime next year. And we think just what the words used, we think are really very important. I think that it will be a winding down. I think they will sort of ease on down the road, so to speak, when it comes to slowing the pace of the increases in their benchmark rate. I think we're going to get 75 bips. I think it's pretty obvious in November and in December, almost would be, I think the market would be pleasantly surprised with 50. But I think it could live with 75. But I think we get into next year. It's going to begin to trail lower. Because I think the market just needs to feel that the Fed is having an effect at stemming inflation, not ending it at this point in the process. John Stoffus, Oppenheimer, Chief Investments Shred, just always going to see you. We'll talk to you soon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,33,2022-10-28 16:08:57
4333," you you you you like giving him some credit where building some of the largest platforms in the world. So looking ahead next three to five years probably there is a I would err on the side of giving him a little bit of benefit of doubt but right now they are in a big whirlpool of a negative sentiment. Nobody believes their ability to innovate fight against Apple, fight against macro, fight against TikTok. So the headwinds are outnumbering, outnumbering the Zuckerberg right now versus what his dream, his vision is. And I think there is also a messaging problem here. I think they are making progress versus athletic talk and they are getting hit on macro as well as metaverse. So there are certain forward progress moves but I think that's just getting masked by how they're messaging on the next year's spend plans. Rohe to buy rating would suggest things get better in the next 12 to 18 months. What gets better for this company in the middle of next year? Over the next three to six months I think one of the drivers would be macro in my opinion. As in they already talked about September and October felt better than what it would have been. They are lapping Apple effects so there are two aspects of the headwinds that I think Facebook should start to feel better about one is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,34,2022-10-28 16:13:15
4334," have been their lapping Apple effects. So there are two aspects of the headwinds that I think Facebook should start to feel better about. One is how they're tackling Apple headwinds and how some of the macro headwinds are ebbing. Beyond that, their AI investments should start with how their engagement is trending and perhaps TikTok headwind starts to ebbing flow at that point. So we are talking about over the next six months. That's the way I feel if I'm right, that's how the stock would unfold. But again, they need to prove that they can be disciplined with costs and that I'm afraid may not happen for another six months at least. What part of the metaverse does meta-platforms actually have to get right, see some type of user kind of acceleration and adoption of what they're putting on the market versus what Roblox metaverse has already looked like for so many consumers. Again, I think metaverse, that bucket of investment is going exactly in the opposite direction as compared to what we thought it would at this time last year. I think they're doubling down on the hardware software combo suite. It is almost 10 years ago, an Apple or Android trying to create their own phones, create their own app store, trying to market the app store and trying to get engagement. All of that in one fell swoop for a new device that nobody is currently using. So I think it's a significantly larger vision than what we thought and that is going to take more investments. And I think near term, all they need to show is greater adoption of their form factor. Whether that form factor improves over the next 12 months, we don't know, but just overall better adoption of form factor and that's not coming in here. So the sentiment is going to be negative in my opinion. So the only thing they can do is show disciplined costs and reducing spend. If they just tell the world that okay, we are going to be disciplined and not have more than 2 billion of losses per quarter in metaverse, I think the stock goes up. I just don't know when that's happening, right? They didn't show any indication doing that. To come back to the metaverse numbers for a minute, Horizon World, according to the Wall Street Journal, has only 200,000 monthly active users. 500,000 was the target the company originally set. When do you think they might get to 500,000? It's been slow going. It has not been going in the direction that they have been. We are hearing more of not just direct to consumer, but direct to businesses, be to be play in the way they feel, the VR headsets and VR capabilities may evolve over the next 12 months. So they gave around some 10 bits yesterday around how enterprises may be using this. So it's still very early days. We want to see that a company with more than $100 billion in revenues per year, for that to start to show some impact, it's probably going to take a few billion dollars in revenues and probably we are at least a couple of years away for their virtual reality, a segment to start to get to say $5 billion in annual revenue run rate, just to start to show some moving the needle. It's going to take a lot longer than that. That's where we say patients, patients, patients, and whether investors have that so far, they don't think they have that. Well, investors are not exhibiting a lot of patience today. We'll see what happens going forward. M. Kemp Partners, or Hid Kolkarni, thank you very much. Appreciate it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,35,2022-10-28 16:17:42
4335," you you you the service now seeing a lot of interest on Yahoo Finance following a better than expected quarter and rather upbeat earnings call the software company announced CEO Bill McDermott will also assume the service now ticker page on our platform stocks of 15% my question to you. Where's the recession? Oh Brian thank you very much you know the the waters out there are choppy and that's why the world seems to need the now platform and has demonstrated that in their decision making look we have a platform that's truly a once in a generation deflationary force. We're seeing tremendous impact on the world. We're seeing tremendous adoption for not only all things IT and digital transformation but companies aren't hiring as much in some case they're firing and you got to do more with less of this idea of workflow automation to give employees a great experience. On the customer service side you know it's one thing to engage a customer to sell something it's another thing in the mid and the back office and the supply chain to optimize the whole experience and that's where service now going to be. I've been saying all along the digital transformation tailwinds were much stronger than the macro headwinds but you do have to adopt to the environment and I'm blessed to work with 20,350 women and men that did just that. Turnkey ready to run solutions for a better world. Bill I just got I want you to expand on this a little bit because it is just such a different message than we are hearing from some of the other companies within technology and even within enterprise software, right? They are seeing that choppiness but it seems to be more of a problem. So I mean is it there something more unique about the company or about the niche that you guys are filling right now? That's a great question, Julie. There's a very unique platform. You know there was the operating systems, there was the database and the application software era, we're now in the platform era. And what companies are trying to do is they're trying to drive productivity to try and automate their supply chains, they're trying to rethink their procurement processes. They have to really do more with less. And the reason that choosing this platform is it is one holistic platform that was engineered by the company and the company is trying to do the same thing. And the reason that choosing this platform is it is one holistic platform that was engineered for deflation. It was engineered for efficiency and it was engineered to give fast return on invested capital. So you're seeing a platform that's being adopted by one large manufacturer as an example that's taking a billion out of their procurement costs on the now platform. And we have them up and running in less than a hundred days. This is a major corporation. So this has never been seen in enterprise software. And our brand is now becoming best known for that platform. The now platform. The now platform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,36,2022-10-28 16:22:12
4336," Corporation. So this has never been seen in enterprise software and our brand is now becoming best known for that platform, the now platform, the digital transformation engine or the center of gravity of digital transformation in today's modern enterprise. It is all about the technology, the people in our company, our incredible culture and our ever-expanding ecosystem. It's really fascinating to see how quickly we were able to adjust to a tough environment with the best technology and the best team. You've got other companies within the tech landscape that want to take the applications that people use, companies are using, employees are using on a day-in-day basis and put it in you know a virtual reality, put it in the metaverse, is the metaverse really going to be real for so many of these applications or is that just a pipe dream perhaps that we're seeing some of the market move towards. I think there's a real place in the world for the metaverse and it is real but even if you do spend time in the metaverse you always have to come back down to earth where the real people live and actually execute your business plan and I think that's where we come in. You know we have no issue with enabling somebody's dream for example to set up a emol and become the retailer of the future in the metaverse creating digital experiences with somebody that they would have never participated before. Let's say a fashion show where somebody can actually simulate in the metaverse that they're in Milan watching the fashion. That's great and then what's even greater is if they see something that they want to buy they can actually buy it and then we can optimize it in a real supply chain in a real manufacturing process so we can actually make a real sale. So you're always going to see this interdependency between a metaverse world and the real world where business takes place and that's where we come in we play both places. Bill for what it's worth I'm bullish on the real world but maybe that's just me. Talk to me a bit about your job retraining effort you talked a little bit about it on the earnings call and the earnings press release but it sounds like a big initiative for you guys. It's really exciting Brian you know we announced rise up with service now and we're going to train a million people by 2024. Some of those people will work for service now. Many of those people will work for partners of service now and many of those people work for customers of service now. We realize that this is a once in a generation platform and this is a once in a generation opportunity to grow super fast and make a real difference in the world economy. You know there's an 11.5 trillion deficit based on the skill deficit in the world. We believe it's the opportunity deficit. So by 2028 we're going to help the world close that 11.5 trillion GDP deficit by bringing service now and literally millions of people in the ecosystem to service now so we can transform the businesses of our customers in the public and the private sector all over the world. Super exciting time. Bill I'm sorry I lied to you last time we had you on and said we'd talk basketball because the NBA season did just start back up so next time we will have to talk a little basketball CEO of service now and chairman Bill McDermott. Thanks so much for the time Bill.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,37,2022-10-28 16:26:26
4337," you you you James CEO in a first on Yahoo interview. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, as we were breaking down some of the earnings that have just come across, and largely the season that we've been navigating through, if there's kind of a common denominator or a set of them that you've been taking away from this, what are they from your perspective? Well, first, great to be here, and it's always good to be on the show. There's just a lot of uncertainty, and I think this is the great thing in our business is people need their financial advisor more than ever. You have uncertain equity markets. All you have to do is listen to four or five speakers with different views, so it's not certain where we're going. The Fed clearly has said they're gonna continue to raise interest rates and inflation numbers high. The GDP number was actually good today, but again, that shows economies going. So it's, you know, you have to pick stocks. You have to pick your choices because it's a very uncertain market. And frankly, in the last almost decade, as long as you were in, you did pretty well. And that's not the case today. So, and investors aren't, you know, their individuals are in different situations. Some are still longer term, and they can take the downs with the ups. Some can't afford the risk. And now fixed income is giving them a chance to invest in. And most people are in between. How do I balance the long term bets and equities against inflation versus making sure I have income? And, you know, so it's complicated environment, but it's a chance to really, you know, show your value also. Paul, it's good to see. Thanks for being here. If people are coming to you because they're concerned about the environment and they want advice as they seem to be, what is happening in terms of their willingness to pay for it? I did see asset management fees were down 6%. Collectively, but I wonder what's happening on an individualized basis. Have you been, I mean, we've been talking everybody about raising prices. Are you all raising your fees? Well, you look at, you know, the, with us, the advisor really has the primary client relationship and the fee pricing is really set with them, with our oversight, but to the what they're doing for their client. And what we've seen is most advisors aggressively managing fees in terms of what funds they go in, what and how they're managing, what the cost is to the investor, but to the incline, but surprisingly, I mean, those fees with the advisor have held up extremely well. And I just shows the value. The value isn't just investing. It's psychology, you know, so many people wanted to get out of the market pre-COVID. They would have lost a huge opportunity where they can look at the down in the last few months and say, well, look at my down and they can remind, look, this is your, you're on plan. This is your plan for your life. You were up, you know, more than you thought. You're down a little bit now, but you're still on plan. Stay invested so you don't get hurt. And that value in almost a family psychologist in many cases is showing that people are still.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,38,2022-10-28 16:30:46
4338," and stay invested so you don't get hurt. And that value in almost a family psychologist in many cases has shown that people are still willing to pay the fees and the fee to the advisor themselves is been under surprisingly a lot less pressure than the overall cost for us to produce more effectively. Paul, a lot of your peers in the industry are now looking at a lot of belt tightening as the industry has slowed. What are you doing inside of Raymond James? Well, we're trying to be very thoughtful. So first, we have conct pressure as the whole industry has seen. We start talking about it a year ago and before people did it, and we're going to treat our people well both with our record results this year and quarter. But also because that's the market today and we have to make sure we keep people. We can only belt tighten so much. We're still growing. We're growing across all of our businesses. And so we're still recruiting and hiring people. So the focus is where do you spend smartly and where do you stay focused? Like for example, our tech spend is going up. Our technology for which we believe is leading edge industry leading for our advisors in terms of wealth planning, we can't let that slip because that's what's driven our continued top of the industry recruiting and retention. And now the apps to the individual clients. Again, we got to get best there because that's part of the market. So in other areas in the back office, we pride ourselves in top level service. And we have to push to be more cost efficient and what technologies and processes can we use to keep those costs in check. So we're still in growth mode. We're cautious on the economy. The great thing about the company, well before I got here, it's always been long term focused. We've been criticized maybe over the last few years of having too much capital and liquidity. We aren't right now. And so in bull markets maybe we look like we're being too conservative. But we plan for these kind of markets. And that's it's showing up in our growth. And we still have plenty of balance sheet flexibility to operate even if we do have a hard landing. When you think about the absence of easy money policies and what that means for some of the more speculative assets that even the wealthiest clients that you may deal with would be prone to perhaps nibble at in the past. Wherever you've seen that strategy start to wane and perhaps shift into some of the other spaces. And what types of recommendations are you providing them? Well, you still see that as kind of cyclical. So certainly when rates move quickly like they have, so if you go to the bond market, certainly the non-rated bonds and things get hit first and get hit hardest. But at some point at that price adjustment, that's when the very wealthy or hedge funds or investment funds see the opportunity in the best. So it's really calling when that happens. So you have to look through the whole cycle and look at the opportunities for those clients. Now a lot of clients don't have that extra network. So you've got to keep them down the middle. But others that do have that ability. It's kind of a wait and see and strike when they see the opportunity. Now if you believe there's going to be a hard landing, that means there's going to be a lot more opportunity and you keep powder dry. If you think this is going to be a softer one and you're going to get a pickup, then you can be a little more aggressive now. And we see clients on all sides of that right now. So it's, again, not an easy call to say, where are we going to be six months from now? But from a company standpoint, with our flexible balance sheet, we didn't lock in rates with a lot of our competitors did. And we're seeing the benefit of that now. And we just don't try to focus on maximizing short term earnings. We're saying over a cycle, what's the right thing to do? And so even if it gets into tough times, I like where we're positioned right now. We always appreciate your soothing tone, Paul, especially in these crazy times. Always going to get some time with your Raymond James C. Paul Riley. See you soon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,39,2022-10-28 16:35:00
4339," you you you it add business that has been the big revenue driver over the years. Yeah, I thought the most interesting takeaway was the silence. And I thought the best question on the big call that everybody could hear was, you know, everything you're talking about is new. This all sounds very experimental. Why isn't it experimental to you and what about the old business? And I think, you know, I think Mark's answer was like, either he's not focused on the old business or he doesn't think there's a future in the old business. But nothing they spoke about yesterday actually is the business that today is worth 300 billion market cap and used to be worth 700 billion market cap. It's almost like he's walked away from the core business that is making all, historically, has made all the money. I thought that was the most interesting thing from the call. And Laura, I mean, when you're talking about walking away from the core business, I mean, should he be focusing on Facebook? Is this what investors want? They don't want this sort of experimental into the future. And especially during a time like this, do you think timing has something to do with this? I mean, I thought your point was fair that the market right now wants current cash flow. It wants to bring lower risk. So it wants cash on cash returns. I'm just, I think the way I read his choices is he's worried there isn't a core business unless he can stymie TikTok. Like that he's worried TikTok is going to take away all of his content creators and his audience. And like my space, when you may recall Facebook took all of my spaces value away. It sounds to me like he's worried TikTok is going to take all of his value away unless Reels works, which is his knockoff of TikTok. So it just feels to me like this is a business at Facebook where every 10 years, Snap comes along and he has to copy it or dies. TikTok comes along and he has to copy it or die. One of these days, you won't be successful copying the hot new thing. And it's, I just wonder if there's actually a business here that is defendable. Yeah, I mean, Laura, to that point, you know, we were talking about the tough environment meta is already dealing with in terms of regulation. We know what the track record is with these acquisitions whether it is an acquisition or taking an idea from another company. When you look at where they want to go with the metaverse, I mean, how convinced are you that the innovation internally is there to make this",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,40,2022-10-28 16:39:19
4340," position or taking an idea from another company when you look at where they want to go with the metaverse. I mean, how convinced are you that the innovation internally is there to make this even if it's long term a viable business? Look, I think Facebook has realized or meta now is realized that it doesn't control its destiny. It doesn't own its content because content creators are leaving it right now to go create content on TikTok and taking their fandoms with them. It doesn't own its distribution platform because it's sitting on Apple and Apple is capricious and arbitrary about changing its rules. Apple doesn't really care if it's rules hurt meta. I think meta's answer to that is to let's create a new computing platform like ARVR glasses where we are the platform background. We charge everyone else 30 percent and we change our rules capricious and arbitrarily and hurt apps on our platform. I think that's their play there. I think this really stepped up when Apple started making privacy changes in the fourth quarter of 2021. So I think he's realized like a lot of apps have that so long as Apple or Android control the policies on their platform and they are answering to regulatory fears on their end that and no app is safe. No app controls its destiny. So his play with the meta versus to actually own the hardware that is the platform that consumers use. So he can charge 30 percent and change rules. So with that said, Laura, what do you value this company at? Is it about the future play? Is it a metaverse play or is it still a social media company that just hasn't been able to compete in an increasingly crowded environment? I would say the latter. But I think it's hard to value because it's unclear there is a core business here if they can't successfully replicate TikTok with reels. So I think the core business value is a big question mark, especially maybe outside the US is okay, but in the US it really is worrisome. And then the metaverse you have to put about in order to value this company, you must decide is the metaverse going to work? Are we going to write off 10 to 20 billion dollars a year in his spending until he figures out it's not going to work? So I think that's the issue with valuing this company now. Tired to value the core business in a network of fixed business, it's going the wrong way. And it's hard to value what the metaverse will be worth because at the earliest he's saying it's going to be worth something in 2030, which feels like a long way off for investors. So I think investors are doing the right thing today by using their liquidity and exiting the shares until it is clear what the value of either the core businesses or the value of those metaverse investments are, both of which are really hard to value today. Yes, certainly a steep fall from yesterday when you look at where the stock is down right now. Laura, always good to get your insight. Laura Martin, need them, internet analyst.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,41,2022-10-28 16:43:52
4341," you Last time mortgage rates were north of 7% the first spider-man movie had just debuted in theaters. Eight films and three spider-men later the 30 year fixed is back above 7 to 7.08% up from 694 last week and 314% just a year ago So that's according to Freddie Mac. Let's talk about the housing picture with Mike, Fred and Tony, Chief Economist and Senior Vice President at the Mortgage Bankers Association. Good to see you sir. So where are these rates headed? Will we see eight before we see six? It's a good question and I would say one of the prime features of the market today is just an incredibly high level of volatility. Rates are bouncing around like crazy. So if you look at the 10 year treasury today, it's down about 40 basis points from a recent high and that tends to be a benchmark that mortgage rates track pretty closely. So day to day, it's unclear where we're headed, but I think over the next six, 12 months we're likely to see mortgage rates lower than we see them today. How much lower make do you think? So our forecast is probably back to about a five and a half percent rate. So I don't see any way we get down to the three percent rate we had in 2020 and 2021. But 7% is really unsustainably high as well. And we think there's two forces out there. The Fed is pushing up short term rates to try to combat inflation. But on the other hand, we're forecasting every session for next year. And there's a lot of global weakness that's going to be putting some downward pressure on longer term rates. And that'll really be helping to bring mortgage rates back down to a more typical longer rate. So how would you characterize the impact of these higher rates in terms of how they have hurt the housing sector and push towards 23. What will happen to home values? So really beginning this spring sort of late May June, it was just sticker shop. You know, we saw borrowers that were looking to buy a home. Their mortgage payment was four or $500 more than when they first sat down to come up with a budget for that home purchase. So people just backed away. I think as we get into 23 again, we have the challenges coming from a weaker economy and likely a rising unemployment rate. But then the benefits of we think mortgage rates drifting lower. And one of the biggest challenges home buyers face the last couple of years was just the lack of inventory on the market. We think it'll be a little bit easier to find a home in 2023. There'll probably be fewer situations of that multiple bids above this price. And I think for that, particularly that first time buyer, it'll be really more thoughtful exercise. You won't have to make the offer the minute you see the home. You might actually have a little time to think about it. But from a housing market and mortgage market perspective, it'll be a slower market in 23 than we had in 2022. We think mortgage originations are going to fall about 9% in 2023 compared to what we saw this year. And this year, volume is about half what it was last year. And we think it's a huge drop expected there into 2023. So given that that we've already seen a number of layoffs within the mortgage industry. I guess how do you see that playing out then if you're expected to slow down even further next year, how many cuts can we potentially be looking at? Yeah, so in the mortgage industry, there's the two types of loans that made right there's refinances, which are entirely rate dependent those have just shut off this year. We're down more than 85% in terms of refinance loans compared to last year at this time. Purchase loans have also dropped again, do the sticker shock phenomenon. But we have an estimate that peak to trough with the peak being in late 21, the trough being in early 23. The industry is probably going to lose 25 to 30% of employment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,42,2022-10-28 16:47:57
4342," at peak to trough with the peak being in late 21, the trough being in early 23, the industry's probably gonna lose 25 to 30% of employment. And we're probably about a third of the way there so far shows you're still gonna see additional layoffs and some consolidation in the sector. And that is part of the Fed goal, of course, is not just bringing down home values, but of course helping out with the labor market as well. There are many that fear the housing sector could be the one thing to break because it is the first one to feel the pain. How concerned are you? Yeah. So you look back at business cycles over the past several decades, you regularly would see the housing market we can first when rates first went up. But by the other end of the token, we expect the housing market's gonna rebound first as well. So I think the recession will probably be in the first half of 23, but as rates drop, buyers re-enter the market we expect we're gonna see housing lead the economy out of recession as we get into the second half of 23. So then Mike speaking to that, I guess comparing the situation that we're in right now to what we saw back in 2006, 2007, 2008. And I bring that up because of the delinquency rates. And I know it's something that you are tracking very closely, but where we are today, it's not too far from that record low that we set in May. So what does this tell you just about the comparisons that some people are drawing to today to what we saw about 15 years ago? Yeah, I would say it's night and day, right? And you know, 2006, 2007, you had a housing boom like we'd never seen before. You saw very loose mortgage credit and you saw really an abundant supply of homes on the market. Coming into this, housing supply was really quite tight. Credit criteria are extremely tight, both because of what lenders are doing and then really some of the regulations that we put in post great financial crisis have really locked in really traditional underwriting and sound credit behavior. So I think the housing market is in relatively good shape. And again, the under supply is a real critical factor here that is going to prevent home prices for really dropping the way we did see during the great financial crisis. And I think it's also going to lead to a rebound as we get past this period of weakness and its mortgage rates return to more typical levels. Yes, certainly a very different situation what we were looking at in the last recession, right? Mike, Fred and Tony, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. Thank you. A rail strike that could cripple the U.S. economy is once again a possibility after a second union voted down the proposed contract and the strike could happen as soon as next month unless all 12 rail unions vote in favor or Congress steps in here to talk a little bit more about this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,43,2022-10-28 16:52:17
4343," the proposed contract and the strike could happen as soon as next month unless all 12 rail unions vote in favor or Congress steps in here to talk a little bit more about this than the labor market. A large we want to bring in Tom Perez, American bridge, 21st century co-chair and former labor secretary under President Obama. Secretary, it's great to see you. So let's start with the rail strike because that's really front and center today. Clearly stakes are very high right now, the possible strike coming at a time when the economy is already slowing. It seems like a pretty attractive possible agreement. You're 24 percent wage hike. Yet that doesn't seem to be enough. I guess from your position as former labor secretary, what do you think needs to happen in order for these two sides to reach an agreement? I think they'll get there. And you know, for my way of history, I remember when the West Coast ports in 2015 were on the verge of strike. And President Obama dispatched me out there. And there were a lot of predictions of gloom and doom and we were able to reach an agreement. And when you have so many different unions involved, it's always a challenging process. But I have confidence that they'll get through it because there's a real win-win opportunity, really win-win-win-win-win for the workers, win for business, and win for consumers. And I think there's an acute appreciation that we cannot afford a work stoppage right now. And so I think they will get there. And again, I've been involved in these dynamics and it's always darkest before the dawn. And I think they'll get there. Indeed. And you mentioned the dock workers. They are currently working without a deal as strike as possible there as well. And Amazon is trying to unionize and Starbucks is trying to unionize. Is this just the tip of the iceberg and a result of this tight labor market? Well, workers have leverage. And I think that's good. And they're using that leverage and you see a lot more activity in unionization, whether it's at Starbucks stores or Amazon facilities. I think that's a good thing. And I think you will continue to see workers' wax muscle. And you look at the public opinion data. The public opinion of labor unions is that it's highest market and decades. People understand that unions help bring us the weekend and unions have helped bring us shared prosperity. And so you're going to continue to see this across the country. I think it's a good development. And I think unions, management, business, consumers can all succeed together. And that's what we have to do. Make sure that workers who are toiling every single day get their fair share of the pie. Speaking of workers, the labor market, I want to bring up a letter that Senator shared Brown recently sent to Fed Chair, Jay Pally, sent it earlier this week coming ahead of the Fed's meeting next week. And in that letter, he wrote, for working Americans who already feel the crush of inflation, job losses will make it much worse. We can't risk the livelihoods of millions of Americans who can't afford it. So of course, this brings front and center of the debate about what the Fed should be doing. Are they at risk of overshooting? I guess now, do you think it's time for the Fed to pause? Or what do you think the Fed should be doing at the next meeting? Right. I hope they don't overstate it. And when people ask about inflation, inflation is real. I feel it. You feel it. At the same time, remember where we were. I remember when I was Labor Secretary. And what we saw in 2009 was the stimulus bill wasn't enough. And when I got to the Labor Department, we had millions of long term unemployed folks, many of whom are 50 and above less than a college degree who had been out of work for a year and a half, and you know what, they were in big trouble. We didn't have to deal with this this time because we had a robust stimulus plan. Did it contribute to some of the inflation? Possibly. But I will tell you, I lost a lot of sleep over the millions of Americans who had lost their job for a year or two years. And frankly, we're hard pressed to get it back. We don't have that problem. We don't want to create that problem by overcompensating. So I hope the Fed will take that into account in their next meeting. But Mr. Secretary, Democrats were fiercely critical of President Trump for criticizing the Fed when he would raise rates. Why is it okay for Sherrod Brown and John Hickenlooper to do the same thing? Well, I think they're simply addressing that conspiracy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,44,2022-10-28 16:56:44
4344," raise rates. Why is it okay for Sherrod Brown and John Hickenlooper to do the same thing? Well, I think they're simply addressing a concern that a lot of people have right now, which is that if the Fed takes action, which results in a recession, people are going to lose their jobs. But doesn't that jeopardize the independence of the Fed? No, the Fed is going to do what the Fed does, but the Fed doesn't operate in a vacuum and I look at Senator Brown's letter as simply a plea for them as they make decisions that they're going to be making to understand the doctrine of unintended consequences. I don't see that as exercising undue influence. He's not saying if you do this, we are going to do X. He's just saying, please remember, please look at history. Please don't over compensate. Yeah, and I think it is raising some eyebrows, obviously, given the time of it, the fact that we are only two weeks, less than two weeks, until the midterms. So, speaking of midterms, Secretary, I want to get your thoughts just on the messaging that we've heard from the White House, because today, pivoting, once again, focusing on the economy, and over the last several months, I think the feeling out there is that the messaging from the White House has been very mixed. I guess first off, what do you think the messaging should be or needs to be over the next two weeks? We have your back. We climbed out of this pandemic. We created 10 million jobs under Joe Biden. We had the quickest recovery from the pandemic in US history. We see manufacturing moving at a wonderful clip. Look at the investment in the CHIPSAC, the company in New York announcing a multi-billion dollar investment. We're bringing down the cost to prescription drugs. We are working on the issues that matter most to you, and we are protecting a woman's right to choose. These are the pocketbook issues. These are the issues that people are thinking about, and that's why, in a normal midterm environment, we'd be prepared to get shellac. But this is the most fluid environment I've ever seen, and it's fluid because we have put points on the board. We have been fighting on the right side of issues for people, and we've got to make sure that voters understand that as they head to the polls. But the singular issue that you hear in poll after poll after poll that matters to Americans most is inflation, and it is still out of control, and that's why, or part of the reason why this NBC poll found that Americans trust Republicans on the economy 20% more than Democrats. So will that message from President Biden sell? Well, we're going to continue to make sure that people know the facts. I mean, the Republican response to today's challenge is, let's cut Medicare and let's cut Social Security. Those are my words. Those are things that Republicans like Ron Johnson have proposed. I don't think that's going to help people in any way, shape, or form. And so, you know, this, we're now at the stage of this campaign. It's about turnout. I mean, we have an election after election. We could go over Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, et cetera. We've got all these elections that are razor thin. And I think in the end of the day, we are going to surprise so many people because we saw on those five special elections post-dobs Democrats doing well, and not just in blue areas, but in places like Kansas. And so this is a turnout election, and that's what Democrats are doing, and they're doing it well. You see the early vote numbers and a number of states are frankly, eye-popping. I think Georgia is going to exceed their 2020 early vote numbers. And so, it's going to be razor thin. We're swimming upstream against historic tides and midterm elections, but notwithstanding that, we're very much in the ballgame because we have put points on the board. And the president deserves a lot of credit for what he has done. We'll see the outcome in just 12 days from today. Secretary Perez, always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. My pleasure. Have a wonderful day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,45,2022-10-28 17:01:01
4345," They'll fill Huchin along with Tony Fidel, Dysport member, Ness Founder, and inventor of the iPod. Humans need to be around other people. I mean, it's one of the things that make us like human and seeing like an amazing performer. It's one of the things that you remember for the rest of your life. There's always unintended consequences in everything. And I, you know, technology's neutral. It's what we choose to do with it, how we regulate and what we socially accept. I think we got a lot of fish to fry. And we are frying ourselves. So I think we need to spend more time on fixing the climate than we need to worry about getting into the metaverse. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Surwer and welcome to our guest, Phil Huchin, the founder and CEO of Dys. Also, Tony Fidel, a board member of Dys. Tony, as you may know, former Apple executive, iPod, inventor, iPhone, co-inventer, also Ness Founder, and a principal at future shape, which is an investment and advisory firm working with engineers and scientists, developing deep, well, foundational deep technology, I should say. Got all that. OK, we want to talk about Dys. And Phil, why don't you start us off by telling us what Dys is all about, what you guys are doing? Yeah, no problem. And I see you, Andy. Well, first of all, Andy, have you ever bought a ticket? Yes, I have. And how was that? Not so good, Phil. And so I think that every time I kind of asked someone over the board of ticket, that has ever come back to me and with like this, like, oh my god, it was amazing. It was always like, I bought a ticket. I thought it was one price, and it was another price. Or I couldn't buy a ticket and was thousands of dollars or whatever it was. Or I'd missed out on the show, whatever it is. And so there's lots of problems around it, and the opaque nature of the industry. So Dys is a super simple way to find out what shows are going on, two taps, and you bought the ticket. It's killed, scalping. And if you can't turn up to the show, you tap a button and you go to refund. And it's just making all these things traditionally associated with going to a live experience. They're gone, and now it's just very easy. I have a million more follow-up questions and we'll get to them. But Tony, I got to ask you, you joined the board of Dys in September. What made you a believer? And why join at a time when the live music industry is still getting back on its feet with COVID? Sure, Andy, as well. It's great to see you. So for me, music's in my blood. Given my past, and I'm from Detroit. So when I was in Detroit, exactly, ticket master first came out. And it was like a revolution. I could go walk down the local store and get a printed ticket. You'd have to go to the box office. And so that was an incredible innovation for me. But since that part, they haven't innovated a lot. It's still like, OK, what can we do to extract more money from the fans, really, is what it is. And it hasn't been about more convenience, about more access, making it easy. You can say what you want about airline ticketing or other travel ticketing. At least you can exchange tickets, upgrade, then change the dates. I'm going to say, you don't have any of those conveniences at all in the ticketing, in the entertainment ticketing in the world, sports ticketing world. Well, that's what Dys is trying to solve. And because I'm such a music fanatic and have been suffering with these six for years, I met Phil. And I didn't just get involved with Dys this year. I've been involved with Phil and Dys. I don't know, five, six years now. So this was like, literally, when they were like 10, 12, 15 people. So we've been working together with them and just been because of the experience that they really want to bring. Fans first, it's all about the fans. Even the artists, the venues, everyone understands that. More fans, and especially today when bands are not making any money except for merchandise and for entertainment events. Other than that, they're not making any money on streaming. We see that unless you're the top 100 artists, they don't make any money. So where are they going to make their money? And how are they going to make sure the fan has a great experience? That's what Dys is all about. Phil, I got to ask you about the competitive set. I mean, Tony mentioned ticket master. They're still around, stub hub event bright. What sets you guys apart from?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,46,2022-10-28 17:05:33
4346," Phil, I got to ask you about the competitive set. I mean, Tony mentioned ticket master. They're still around, stub hub, event bright. What sets you guys to part from those companies? And how are you going to build your brand? Right, so I think I kind of touched on it. Like our any customers, the fact. And that was something that we established on day ones. Everything that we built is for that fine experience. When we're building things of partners, of venues, or artists or anything else, we always ask the question, is it good for the fan? And I think that the second thing is that DICE is just software. So if you're looking at the live nation, I mean, they do huge productions, they do all these things, you know, it's ticket master as part of it. We just like using software to bring fans and artists closer together, like helping them decide which cities they are, and how much they should be charging. All these things to make it super efficient. And I think that the third is that we're able to scale much quicker around the globe. So maybe we started off in London, but now we're in the US, in France, Spain, Italy, India, Australia, moving into Southeast Asia. So it's like, it's kind of, there's a global network of that that happens as well, because you're giving that data to artists to help them plan global strategies themselves. So it's just really, when we're talking about empowering artists, it's like helping them, you know, control the cash that they own, the cash they can pay people and do things instead of waiting for someone to pay them. How do you mitigate against scalpers? You mentioned that. Can you drill me in a little bit more there? Yeah, cool. So this is, I mean, it's like things where in hindsight, it's like so simple, but there's nothing to sell. Can you buy a ticket on DICE? There's no ticket. And so there's nothing, there's nothing to screenshot. There's nothing to pass on to somebody else. There's nothing else. Just moments before the show, there's like an animated QR code that goes around, which is there. But it's a very elegant, simple solution, but it's a way that, you know, if you've got nothing to sell, and then it's impossible for scalpers to put on any platform, because they don't have anything. And how much of the business bills rely on upon the return of live music to pre-pandemic levels? And what is your prediction about when that'll happen? So we have just spent 18 months or, you know, we're going to take, and like sort of stuck in our homes, been entirely digital. And you're thinking about, you know, one of the things that I didn't appreciate, you know, at the beginning of DICE, and kind of really kicked in sort of just before, before the pandemic, because that we saw some data on terms of loneliness for people aged between 17 and 21. And a third of them expressed that they had intense periods of loneliness. Even before the pandemic. You put the pandemic on everyone kind of living digitally. The return to live since summer, it's been insane. I mean, every record has been broken at DICE in the last, what, five months. When we're looking at the data, like still now, shows are completely packed, like the venues are packed, everything else. You're in the newspapers that, you know, people have become hesitant about stuff, and then you go to live concerts and they're absolutely full. And I think it's kind of going back and to, as I was talking about with learners, that humans need to be around other people. I mean, it's one of the things that make us like human and seeing, like an amazing performer. It's one of the things that you remember for the rest of your life. So, you know, live experiences, I think that people are actually appreciating them even more as a result of the pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,47,2022-10-28 17:09:47
4347," you you you you you you you of the bookers or whatever else. And then part of that is, so I've got an example. So it's an artist in London pulled by, they started off with us from the very first show, 200 people, and made the deal with them, like, called, sell exclusively through DICE, unless kind of I build up this live story. And then from that, you know, you're not allowed to spend any money in social media advertising, you got to trust it to your audience, but get the story right. Now they can sell 50,000 tickets in London, and it's kind of like taking them at each of those steps all the way through. And throughout the whole time, BICEP understood their audience, they knew what they wanted, where they weren't to play. They had control over, you know, their live strategy, and this is what we're doing at scale now. Right. And so do you cover all the venues in the world, or do you have, there are some venues that are not a part of your ecosystem yet? Yeah, so we, we, we, we made sure that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,48,2022-10-28 17:14:04
4348," You cover all the venues in the world, or do you have to, are there some venues that are not a part of your ecosystem yet? Yeah, so we wish we had, we have all the best ones, most of the best ones. So there's some holdouts, but there's other people who have the ticketing rights for those venues. So we have, it's 3,600 venues, sort of around the world, which is increasing day by day. And we also work largely in major cities. So the, you know, in New York, over a million people used dice last month. And so it's quite a big spread of venues in New York. And for that, it's the same in Paris and Barcelona, all these things, because there's lots of events happening there. So the discovery engine is really kicking off. And our thing is that if you want to see a show once a month, then let's get you to show once a week, how to reduce the friction for you to actually, you know, get there. So, you know, our competition is like people stay home in the home, which, you know, Netflix is like, okay, well, how do we make it as easy and compelling to kind of get out and see something in books? I don't think anyone's been to a great show and said, well, not doing that again. So it's the exact opposite. Tony, while I have a year, I gotta ask you a few questions about Apple, the iPhone, Silicon Valley. Oh, God. So you were on the cutting edge and designing the iPhone, but it's been around for a while. What do you think is kind of the next big thing in terms of consumer tech? Thoughts on the metaverse? Those are two big questions happening right now. Well, the big things on the horizon for consumer electronics, you know, we're hearing more about, you know, augmented reality of these kinds of things. We're hearing about the metaverse, you know, frankly, I think we got a lot of fish to fry and we are frying ourselves. So I think we need to spend more time on fixing the climate than we need to worry about getting into the metaverse. So let's make sure you have an environment to live in before we find another environment that, you know, keeps us in like refrigerated chambers and, you know, so that we can breathe and eat. So that's how I feel about the metaverse, you know. But on consumer electronics, I think, you know, a lot of this stuff, people think that this is gonna be the next big thing like augmented reality. I think it will be for certain very niche verticals, but not necessarily like the consumer thing that you need. Because, you know, we saw this before, you gotta need the technology and then you have to understand that the consumers want it, right, and they want to live in that. It live with these things on it and it's social acceptance, not just you accepting it, but the people around you accepting it. And that I've learned all the time is, the technology might be right, but it's the social timing right, is there a social acceptance? And are you truly, are you truly delivering a pain killer because there's a clear need, there's a clear pain. The iPhone solved the, you know, or solved the need, right, was on the go, internet, email, you know, media, these kinds of things. Well, we don't see the need yet for the metaverse and then to have the metaverse wherever you go on you, you know, like, we already tried that with Google Glass. I think it's gonna take a little while. Yeah, and speaking of Google, you invented, helped create the iPhone, the iPod Nest, which was bought by Google and these products are networked now in a huge way. What is your take on both the upside and the downside of this massive amount of networking that some people say, you know, leads to dystopian possibilities, but also tremendous upside? Well, look, there's always unintended consequences in everything and I, you know, technology's neutral, it's what we choose to do with it and how we regulate and what we socially accept. So we have to do things that are promote social bonding, like what Bill's doing with DICE, right? Not letting the ticket bots in there, not letting the scalpers in there, doing all the things necessary and that's why I love what Bill and DICE is doing is they're trying to bring all the best things to connect the artists to the fans, right? And getting rid of all of those middlemen who are just stealing along the way. So that's what we wanna do and I so I love the network, it can have better shows, have the artists make more things for their fans so that the fans have a better and better experience and maybe through that we can create even more social movement to fix some more of these problems.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,49,2022-10-28 17:18:26
4349," for their fans so that the fans have a better and better experience. And maybe through that we can create even more social movement to fix some more of these problems. But it's about bringing people together and not about a network of intermediaries stealing along the way. Or just one more way back machine question. Okay. Okay. And that's you work with Steve Jobs. Yeah. Apple built a music business when you were there. What did you learn from Steve and what do you think he'd be thinking about the world today and the technology that we're using? Well, I think for me, you know, what it was all about in the music store in the iPod, it was always about what do the customers really want? What is going to give them that social or next to me that emotional experience that they crave, you know, that they want and a rational part of that, making it simple and all those other things. And that's kind of, yeah, that's like, so when you see something like that, you're like, wow, I think that if Steve was here today, he would go, we need to get artists more money. I think if he looked at the streaming services out there, I know how much he loved musicians, bands, you know, and wanted to support them. I remember way back when he was looking and buying certain media companies, that kind of stuff, because he really wanted to revolutionize that. And so as far as I'm concerned, if he woke up today and saw the streaming services the way they are today and where the artists are not getting fairly paid, he would fix that. Absolutely. I remember too many infill when he came by and demoed the iPad at time, when I worked there and he played music and he played friend of the devil. And I said, oh, the grateful dead and he goes, I love the grateful dead. You can see he really meant it, right? Yeah, I really passionate about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,50,2022-10-28 17:22:49
4350," You come from a musical background, a music industry background, I should say. But geez, what made you decide to get into ticketing? Yeah, I mean, I wasn't tech before going into the music and I've known anything about the music industry. So very naive, but so very lucky in the music industry that found some artists who were getting bigger and bigger and actually didn't care about ticketing. Didn't understand it because you spent so much time working with the artist and making an amazing album, to make an amazing artwork, looking at their lives. So, and didn't think about the ticketing until the artists got bigger in North America. And that was the, that was when suddenly it was like, hang on a minute, we did a deal for 40 bucks and now the ticket 65, where's this 25 going? It sold out and it's been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars and all the fans are angry at the artists. Like, why is anyone fixing this? And so then I went back into sort of all the new world together and just analyzed all the ticket companies and tried them all out. Didn't want to just try and achieve there was a solution and that was the thing, well, no one else is going to fix it, I guess that we have to do it. So I'm kind of just touching on to the last question as well. I think that's, you know, take a lot of inspiration from, you know, what Tony created, you know, really thinking about the small things, you know, the experience when someone sees it, small little animations within the app, the ticket, the imagery, you talk about brand before, like people, people wear dice t-shirts and have the bags and everything else, like all these things, like things which we really care about because you need to make a revolution and all this stuff like pays off because eventually because of all these things being put together, artists make more money in the right way. I didn't really ask you about the business model or your P&L, how are you doing? That's the company doing so can you dive into that a little bit quickly? Sure, as I mentioned before, it was the pandemic and coming out of it was like, it was a shock. I mean, we went from no one going out to everyone going out. And, you know, from zero people in New York, like sort of going out to a million people going out. So, you know, we have, you know, so for a million in New York in the last month, a million in London, half a million Paris, like all these people sort of coming together. How we make money is that we charge the venues or the artists for using dice as their partner to sell the tickets. So it's like, we're very pro privacy. And so the, you know, again, just protecting the fans from this, but also everyone knows like how we make money, make money from selling the ticket. There's no advertising, nothing else. That's on there. And in terms of the, you know, the volume is like, it's accelerating. It's turning out like every week. Well, let me be clear. We're writing, we're happily writing checks and we're backing these guys. And even in the darkest of times, we see the light and we see the growth and we see the fans and they're coming back, right? It's sticky. People love it. They're telling their friends about it. We do very little advertising. I meet a ton of people go, I go, yeah, I'm in the investor and dice is like, oh, I'm a user. Like, there's so many people. If you actually ask people in the regions where we operate, there's a lot of people using it. We just don't sit there and market it. And, you know, it, it's self-market because the fans love it. And so that's why we keep investing because we know this is the future. And it already is here today. Word of mouth seems to be working. So are you guys venture back, Bill IPO in the future? Perhaps. Yeah. So I venture back and public listening in the future, for sure. Yeah. Great. And Tony, how did you guys meet? So interestingly enough, I had friends in London and they said, oh, you have to meet Bill. You guys would get along. You love music. That's incredibly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,51,2022-10-28 17:27:05
4351," Justingly enough, I had friends in London and they said, oh, you have to meet Phil. You guys would get along. You love music. He's doing something really cool. And Phil and I just were at a hotel, I think it was a ham yard. And we just had a drink. And we just started talking. And we talked all about music. And then we started talking about books and started sharing titles and just getting into psychology of a fan. And what does it mean? And why do we love shows? And really just hit it off. And it was just there. I was like, OK, that's it. And Dice was tiny. It was just a vision. And so it was really about a team and a mission and, you know, and Phil as an entrepreneur and visionary. And Phil, where do you see the company five years, 10 years from now? I mean, doesn't it have to become part of one of the, well, they used to call it fangs. I guess they're mangs now. Part of an ecosystem. Everything's got to be part of an ecosystem. Or can it be a standalone? Do you think going? Yeah, I think it definitely be a standalone. I think that live entertainment, you know, how people look at the, the, the, the, the market right now. I think it's, I think it's undercooked. I think that it's huge. I think that you've, you know, if you've got 90% of the population of the world liking music, maybe half the population loving music and 30% people love music so much that they pay to go see it. And that's a massive market. And I think that, you know, what we're seeing is growing this around the world. I mean, like for example, just starting off in India, that market could be as big as the US within 10 years. Right. I love the Pam thing. You know, that is a truly small set. People who hate music. I hate music. Right. You don't have to worry about that. That's a pretty small group of people, right? It's pretty cool. It was the same time for the iPod. It was the same time for the iPod. Right. Yeah, that's not right. That's not right. Everybody. And final couple last questions here. Phil, what do you think that you want to be your legacy? Wow. I was thinking about that one. OK. You know what? It's the idea. One of the things I love the most, yeah, is the idea that we're in Mumbai, and there's the scene happening in Mumbai, and there's this new music that's happening in Mumbai. And through the connections of DICE, that artist goes straight into the US and Asia and through Europe and blows up. And we do that time, time again. That the idea of bringing culture sort of around the world, that would be awesome. And Tony, same question over to you. You've got all of these things you've accomplished working here with DICE, and I'm sure you've got some all kinds of other things percolating in your brain. What do you hope to accomplish over the following years? For me, it's really about mentoring and investing my time with the entrepreneurs who are truly changing the world for the better, whether that's environmentally, socially, or for health. Those are the three big things, and DICE is doing that for the social, for the social experience all around the world. It's amazing. And that's what I hope. Phil is able to fulfill and bring this mission, and I think he's well along the way to deliver it. Well, it'd be great to watch the company grow as we hope. We emerge from COVID and live comes back. And people get interested in your business. So I want to thank Phil Hutchins founder and CEO of DICE and Tony Bellboard member there, and entrepreneur, and an executive extraordinaire. Thank you guys very much for your time. Thank you so much, Andy. Thanks, Andy. Great to see you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirwork. We'll see you next time. Welcome back to y'all finance. I'm Brian Saazie alongside Julie Heimann and Brett Smith. It's not only in earnings heavy morning with the profit warning by Amazon hanging over the markets. It's a busy day for econ data. And Julie, fresh read on consumer confidence coming in here. Yes, coming in and coming in a little bit ahead of estimates. Very slightly. 59.9 is the reading from the University of Michigan versus the 59.6 that was estimated. The current conditions index a little bit higher even than that 65.6 versus the 65 estimated expectations 56.2.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,52,2022-10-28 17:31:33
4352," It estimated the current conditions index a little bit higher even than that, 65.6 versus the 65 estimated expectations, 56.2, a tick better than estimated. And inflation expectations, pretty much in line, 5% is the one year inflation expectation, 2.9% over the next of 5 to 10 years. This is the final read on these numbers here. So this is not necessarily absolutely fresh data here. But nonetheless, we are seeing some areas of strength here as pointed out by Joenshu, who is the survey of consumers director at the University of Michigan. We are seeing buying conditions for derables of 23% in the month. So some still not terribly discouraging indications. By the way, we talked about PCE earlier. Consumer spending comes out as a part of that PCE report, or alongside it, I should say. And personal spending ticked up 6% to 7% in September, which is better than estimated. Yeah, it's been interesting to track the divergence among some of the affluent parts of the economy, but as well here, low-income consumers are really pointed out within this report, too. Low-income consumers reported sizable gains, in overall sentiment. Consumers with considerable stock market and housing wealth exhibited notable declines, though, in sentiment. Yeah. That is this, too, Brad. Not knowing at the bottom uncertainty over inflation expectations remains elevated. Indicating inflation expectations are likely remain unstable in the months ahead. Not probably what the Federal Reserve members want to hear. Yeah, thank you, not. We're also continuing to watch shares of Apple this morning. Those shares were actually higher just before we got to the 10 AM hour right now, moving on up by about 5% on the day after the tech giants beat earnings expectations for the fourth quarter, but fell short on iPhone sales. Joining us now for a deeper dive into the quarter. JP Morgan Head, Telecom, and Networking Equipment, Analyst, Simeek Chatterjee. Simeek, great to have you here with us this morning. First, we got to look at the iPhone sales. I mean, this is still 60% of the product revenue, 47% of the overall revenue that they bring in. And we don't get that breakout of the actual kind of generations that are being purchased. But if there's anything that you would point to, what would you say about the consumer with the relation to some of the iPhone sales demand that we've seen this far? Yep, no, thanks for having me on the show and happy Friday, guys. So really solid earnings brand and you saw a solid revenue print from Apple as well. I think, creative to the iPhone to your question specifically. What you can see is Apple's threading the balance between volumes and pricing of the pricing increases the 50 million cash in markets very well. So you can see there's obviously a delicate balance here given how consumer spending has been tracking that you need to really be able to drive to deliver resilient results. And Apple has been able to do that. I mean, we've in our data seen some changes here and there in the sense that there are customers that are moving to the pro and the pro max on the iPhone 14 lineup. So preferring the feature upgrades and then on the rather buying the base model sometimes preferring to create down into the iPhone 13. But I think net net what you really want to take away from the iPhone results that you mentioned is one Apple remains supply constrained in the RAM quarter. So that's given some of that miss. But that said, it's still managed to thread that balance between pricing and volume fairly well. Do you think going forward, we've been talking about potential, if not recessionary signals, certainly slow down signals from a number of different companies? Is that going to start to affect Apple in the out quarters? I mean, when you get an Amazon, for example, making a holiday forecast that is broadly disappointing? Does that have implications that maybe people are going to buy the lower priced iPhone for the holidays or maybe they're going to get set mouse entirely? Yeah, no, great question. I think how we've been looking at this is, as you think about the September quarter that they just reported on the December quality quarter, you probably will not see as much impact in these two quarters because there's more of sort of the buying at the higher and people probably using more and more the monthly installment plans and still preferring to go for the higher end products. Typically, what happens, you do see a sort of mix down going into the march and the June quarters, and if you do, I mean, we're not really going to bet here that Apple's going to be completely immune from the macro impact, but clearly there's a product.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,53,2022-10-28 17:35:45
4353," into the March and June quarters. And if you do, I mean, we are really going to bet here that Apple's going to become completely immune from the macro impact. But clearly, there's a product cycle in their favor where they've just launched a new phone. So when you think about even the holiday quarter, I think that the momentum there carries through the December quarter. As you get into March and June, we sort of have to evaluate whether consumer spending stands, but again, what you'll probably find is it's not going to be a surprise that volumes are going to suffer a bit more as consumer spending pulls back, but also because you've taken the price increases in some of these markets. So again, you're trying to sort of balance it out in terms of where you get to in terms of revenue outcomes. And that's what I think the real sort of upside here is. Given how the back row backdrop is, obviously, not everyone on the street is expecting iPhone revenues to be up next year. But what you're seeing now is a greater likelihood that iPhone revenues could be flat to out next year, even despite the consumer spending pull back, as well as sort of comping very strong growth numbers. So that's where the upside is. That's probably what the shares are showing you is that people are believing in pleasingly in the resilience of the portfolio, including iPhone. So how big of a downside risk is China? China market itself, obviously, has been software, right? So we're seeing that across the Android, we use a lot more than we've seen with Apple. I think two things are in favor of Apple when it comes to market share in that country, obviously, some of these restrictions that have impacted Huawei are still continuing to sort of play out in terms of benefits for Apple. Not only are you sort of selling more phones to new sort of breeders and switchers, but obviously there's a large install base of Huawei phones that will certainly come through the market and have to purchase new phones. So iPhones have the opportunity to capture that share. And you're also benefiting from the product cycle and consumers increasingly sort of switching into the iOS ecosystem, the benefits of the ecosystem are starting to play out in that country as well. But clearly it's a market that's a bit more challenged on the consumer spending side. In particularly for us, the watch point is some of the events coming up around the e-commerce events coming up in that country. And sort of what promotions are driven around those events. And so we could see a demand update around those events promotion events in the country. But we're closing one and three and going to monitor that and see how sort of it trends from here on. Apple just raised prices for music subscribers. Do you expect within the services realm that they're going to be increasing some of their other prices? I would say yes. I mean, the expectation would be that you have headwins, both in terms of inflation as well as in terms of sort of currency and the international markets that you need to adjust for. And so the combination of that is probably going to be reflected in a pricing sort of across the board, product, services, et cetera. So you're really looking at more broad-based price increases at this point. Not all of it necessarily means that you're offsetting effects on a completely, you're probably still going to have a net sort of modest negative in relation to sort of when you net that out. But I think that's a fair assumption that you have this inflationary backdrop. And currency that's going against you in the international market. So you need to increase prices. And again, I think what's really true, but the results of showing you is a pricing power that both the products and the services have, which is again getting appreciated by the shared price reaction today. JP Morgan, analyst, Simeek Chatterjee, Simeek, really appreciate the time and the context that you've provided around these Apple earnings that we've been showing on all morning here. Thanks so much. And everyone's switching gears. Let's take a look at the markets right now. As we are just about 38 minutes into today's trading activity, taking a look at the NASDAQ. We've seen that move in deposit of territories up by about half a percent right now, changing this over to an intraday look in. Perhaps we'll get fancy with some candlestick charts. Also, that's up by 51 points there. Dow Jones Industrial Average, you're seeing that up by about 1% right now early in trade. And then additionally, the S&P 500, that's up a little bit more than half a percent. Do want to dive into some of the retail names, though, here on the day as well, especially considering what Amazon had kind of warned within their earnings call after they reported earnings, saying that consumers are cutting their budgets and trying to save a little bit of money. And we'll make this equal way to just for the sake of giving you a full review of what's taken.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,54,2022-10-28 17:40:07
4354," things call after they reported earning, saying that consumers are cutting their budgets and trying to save a little bit of money. And we'll make this equal way to just for the sake of giving you a full review of what's taken place and some of the retail landscape, perhaps investors taking warning to that comment from Amazon on that call, Amazon, of course, on the day, down by about 10%. But look at some of the other names that are also moving in concert with it in the retail sector right now. You've got target down by about 1.9%. You've also got way fair and, yeah, size of his favorite, bedbath and beyond, down by about 8.6%. Here, however, holding onto some gains here to end out the week, you've got Walmart still in positive territory that's up by about 2.10% of a percent there. Perhaps the brick and mortar play investors leaning into that Nike is also up by about 4.10% right now too. So we'll keep a close eye on this retail sector as we move on. Clear, Brad. Bedbath is not my, it's Costco. Ah, yes. That $1.50 hot dog, what they have done this past year, keeping prices at $1.50 in this inflationary environment. I mean, that's impressive. I don't want to confuse our viewers with my sarcasm. So I will. Yeah, I appreciate you. Absolutely. All right, before we had to break, Alphabet is closing out. It's poor earnings being defended by Goldman Sachs, tech analyst Eric Sheridan. Sheridan is retaining a buy rating on Alphabet stock and sees fair value at $135 a share. So Sheridan, while the macroeconomic conditions will likely impact the short term narratives, we remain constructive on the opportunity for search and YouTube in terms of compounded revenue growth, especially for the latter on the back of the opportunity for short form video and connected TV. Coming up, Tesla is facing an investigation into its autopilot feature and Julie is back with that plus more updates top headlines. do Let's get down to business now. Take a look at some other headlines we're watching. The Department of Justice is reportedly launching a criminal investigation into Tesla over its past claims that its vehicles can drive themselves.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,55,2022-10-28 17:44:50
4355," Now take a look at some other headlines we're watching. The Department of Justice is reportedly launching a criminal investigation into Tesla over its past claims that its vehicles can drive themselves. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched a similar investigation. It has the authority to enforce investor protection laws, all this according to the Wall Street Journal. Tesla's autopilot has been under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for about a year now. But these new criminal investigations represent a more serious level of scrutiny. And credit card debt, making a comeback. Card balances fell in the early months of the pandemic. They've since made a U-turn back to pre-pandemic levels. According to data from Equifax, the U.S. total card balance hit $916 billion in September. That's nearly identical to December 2019 levels. This comes after many credit card issuers loosened standards to get people borrowing again as the economy reopened. And the Buffalo Bills have released renderings for their new $1.4 billion, $60,000 seat stadium, almost seven months after creating the framework of the deal. The images include one look at the stadium's exterior and the interior of the open-air stadium. It's scheduled to open in 2026. It'll be across the road from the old stadium, though its development has attracted criticism due to the record $850 million in taxpayer funding. Brad? Thanks so much, Julie. Volkswagen shares they are on the move after the company backed its full-year margin outlook following an increase in operating profit and revenue in the third quarter. The German automaker also says its recovery in China is accelerating, but it is cautious of geopolitical risks. Yahoo, finance is pros, supermanian. Has the details here pros? Amen. Yeah, so they did, you know, sort of talk about operating profit up 60 percent that did miss estimates slightly, but revenue was better too. They reiterated their operating margin guidance for the full year up to seven to eight and that percent, the upper range of that. And also the revenue will be up 8 to 13 percent higher as well. But there is some sort of concern about the future and things like the supply chain crisis and things like that. We have a quote here from CEO Oliver Blumma talking about how we will be faced with crises during the next decade, geopolitical crises, supply chain issues. So they are kind of seeing that, yes, things are good right now, but we may be sort of in a murky area in the future. I want to note that they also said they have 300,000 pre-orders of EVs in Europe alone, so they are working through that battle. Well, that is pretty strong for them right now. Brad, excuse me, when I saw Elon Musk walking to Twitter's headquarters carrying a sink, I may have known him. I got to have to ask Prazis, that is time that he would have spent perhaps on the manufacturing floor of Tesla. I mean, is this a big distraction? You know, when I heard that potentially he is going to be doing what the CEO of Twitter is well, you add that to all the different things that he is doing right now with SpaceX, OpenAI, Boring Company, etc. When does it really take a bite out of his sort of attention span and ability to perform at Tesla? Tesla, working at Tesla and being a CEO there is, that is a full-time job right for anyone, 24 or 7. So I got to ask, when is that actually going to, I think this is like the, maybe this is the one that straw that breaks Kamil's back right now. It is really interesting. I mean, especially considering the broader automotive landscape and all of the attention that has been thrust towards electric vehicles right now, for who is winning the battery battle, we have seen a lot come out over the course of these past two weeks and see what Ford, what GM, what Tesla, what Volkswagen is saying about their batteries. Do you get a sense of who really has the lead in that category? It is hard to say. I mean, we see a lot of the traditional automakers like GM and Ford and even Volkswagen are talking about building battery factories, acquire materials that they need for the next few years to make these cars. I think there is some analysts that say, hey, is there enough material out there to actually make, you know, what is it? Millions of EVs by 2025, 2026 and even more so beyond that. So that's a, that's a big question. You have seen GM and Ford say we've acquired materials for the next couple of years. We've confirmed that. The question is what's going to happen after that. And Tesla, to confirm that they're going to make that lithium refinery in Texas. They are trying to get that materials, the raw materials there too. Probably supermaning, always going to see you. Alright, coming up, a big week for canopy growth as it looks to reignite interest in its stock price. We've got to be growth's CEO David Klein next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,56,2022-10-28 17:48:46
4356," Awards or prizes? Let's go. Can't be growth is looking to fast track is entry into the US cannabis market by creating a new holding company to house its US cannabis investments. Can't be growth. CEO David Klein joins us now. David, welcome to you on this Friday morning. I was talking to an executive at Constellation Brands, an investor in your company. They said from their perspective, this is a win, win, win. Why is this a win for you? This is a win for us because it allows us to put together three really strong cannabis companies in the US under this canopy USA umbrella and begin to address the $50 billion opportunity that is the US cannabis market. David, it's been tricky because of the interdiction on a federal level against marijuana in the United States versus what we have seen in Canada. Not just you, but many of the cannabis companies have done, had to do some real gymnastics to get around all of that. How does this tell us on a concrete level what this means for you, how this sort of enables you to access that opportunity you're talking about? Yeah, I think the important point is that we are putting together strong branded opportunities to address that US market. We need to do so in a way that allows us to ensure that we are keeping our investors like Constellation safe from many potential risks that they may have. We think that allows us the ability to the flexibility to actually be more aggressive as we address the US market and in the structure that we've outlined creates that security for investors like Constellation. David, it's been a while since we talked to some of the team.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,57,2022-10-28 17:53:20
4357," the US market and in the structure that we've outlined creates that security for investors like Constellation. David, it's been a while since we talked to some of the team at a canopy. We were familiar with prior management. Very much ran canopy like it was the Wild West. But you were the former CFO of Constellation Brands. Talk to us about the financial discipline. You and any new executives, your team have put into the company. Yeah, so we talk about ourselves as pioneers because there are challenges that present themselves on a day and a day out basis in this really tricky market. But we think it's really important to focus on execution, which is why we love this canopy USA structure because it allows businesses that we already have an interest in like A Grige, Wana and Jetty to begin working together to extract costs, energies across the business, to extract revenue opportunities across the business as the US market opens. And then clearly as we apply that to Canada, the Canadian market continues to evolve. We continue to have to differentiate ourselves versus a growing competitive set. And I think that is just execution on a day and a day out basis. And it's really not about driving the story of cannabis anymore. It's about executing the business of cannabis. Do you believe that we will see passage of the marijuana banking bill and other legislation that allows for the cannabis industry and for your company to experience the growth that it's anticipating and tapping into this market in the US? Look, there's five more states that have cannabis on the ballot for legalizing adult recreational use this fall. So in already two thirds of Americans live in a state where or locale that where cannabis is legal in some form, we need the federal government to catch up. And there's just a lot of momentum building there. We've seen bills in Congress, both houses of Congress, both parties. And then, you know, a bit of a breakthrough a few weeks ago when the administration announced the beginning of their support for what we believe will ultimately be full federal permissibility. David, in Canada, where there is more broad legalism in permissibility, the market hasn't quite turned out to be as profitable as you and your peers might have hoped for. How do you think the US should maybe take some lessons away or what would you hope for if and when we do get full legalization that is different from the Canadian model? Well, I think one of the things we can do in the US currently is we can talk to our consumers and we can educate our consumers. And we can talk about what cannabis is. And it's a legitimate and important consumer product. And I think being able to just connect with our consumers a little differently in the US market would be a differentiator versus Canada. But you know, as it relates to Canada, we still think the market opportunity in Canada is an outstanding opportunity. Here, it's a $7 billion industry versus the $50 billion industry in the US, but that is a very large market. And we're still in the early days of the market really shaking itself out to be the market that we know will become. Respective of the quiet period that you are in right now ahead of earnings, I got to wonder, you know, naturally for the larger space, how the cannabis industry at a whole is managing through a higher operational expense environment and what that potentially means for just having the financial cash flow in order to whether and navigate even through some of the transitions that you're seeing here. Yeah, clearly every company is fighting the battle for us with the cost inflation and supply chain disruption. For us, we've been able to manage through it nicely across our businesses. We've had we've had some supply shortages in our stores and Bickel vaporizer business, but for the most part, we've been able to manage through with good planning and focus on execution, but we're in the same boat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,58,2022-10-28 17:57:19
4358," of course, and Bickel vaporizer business, but for the most part, we've been able to manage through with good planning and focus on execution, but we're in the same boat, I think, that every other industry is in. All right, I'll leave it there. Canopy Grout, CEO David Klein, good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. T-Mobile CEO has some tough talk for rivals Verizon and AT&T after better than expected. Quarter T-Mobile CEO Mike Seaver joins us for chat. Coming up. T-Mobile is out with above consensus earnings and new customer additions. The company also lifted its guidance for operating profits and cash flow cut up with T-Mobile CEO Mike Severt. You know, we've been saying for years that this company has a unique opportunity to be the first ever in the history of our industry to one day offer the best value simultaneously with the best network. And that day is kind of arriving and customers are noticing and it's so huge. I mean, you think about right now, customers are anxious. The economy has full, full of questions. And what they're looking for is a great value from a brand they trust. And that's T-Mobile. Mike, I want to, I've talked to one of your competitors recently. And it said, you know, customers are laying paying their bills. Are you seeing that? No. In fact, bad debt levels look to us consistent with 2019 pre-pandemic levels. And 2019 was one of our best years ever. So we have seen a creep up from those pandemic levels, but only to one of our best years ever. So we're very interested in this. We're watching in voluntary churn. That's when people don't pay and have to leave. We're watching late payments. But so far, we're not seeing it in anything outside the norms. And you saw that in our overall performance being the only one to reduce overall churn to just 0.888. 8 points less than a year ago. Because people, when they come to T-Mobile, they're finding.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,59,2022-10-28 18:01:55
4359," It's being the only one to reduce overall turn to just 0.888. 8 points less than a year ago, because when they come to T-Mobile, they're finding what they're looking for. Mike, you mentioned that consumers are anxious. These are strange times going into your area. Are you seeing them trade down on what packages they spend for T-Mobile? No, but we are seeing a potential flight to value from other providers. Our principal competitors jacked a big price increases under their customers this summer. While those customers were locked in device repayment plans and could do nothing about it, where we reiterated price lock. The fact that when you come to T-Mobile, only you can change your plan. It's the uncontract. We won't change it for you. That kind of trust that bond we have with our customers is really resonating right now. It's one of the reasons why this quarter, we attracted more postpaid net additions than AT&T and Verizon combined. The sounds like a classic market share grab. Well, that's our strategy. For years, our principal growth strategy has been to grow our share methodically and through the power of our brand. The fact that we put customers first, that we love them, that we treat them right, we give them low prices. And now, combining that with the Leading 5G network, there is a real opportunity for us to resonate with a whole new audience of people that actually never gave us a serious look before. Well, last time I talked to, I think you were still getting the 5G up and running. It was in some spots. What is it now? And how is a different comparative Verizon AT&T? Well, today our broad layer of 5G reaches 97% of Americans. And our ultra-capacity 5G reaches 250 million people. If you asked for a comparison, that 250 million is where Verizon publicly stated they hope to be two years from now. Where do you see, what's the next level of 5G? Where else does it roll out? And what else are you working on? Well, one of the things is putting it to work, all kinds of new use cases. Magenta Max, which is our most popular rate plan, it's actually one of our higher end rate plans, happens to be our most popular because it's the best expression of that 5G network, truly unlimited usage on our network. And customers are using it like never before, but also home broadband. Customers are using our 5G to power the internet in their entire home and they're tearing out cable and fiber to do it because we charge them $50.00 in zero cents. Our net ads and home broadband on 5G were more than the net ads on broadband for AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and Charter combined. Did you leave anyone out? Well, you know, it's interesting. We're comparing ourselves to everyone in the industry and what we're really interested in are net promoter scores, whether or not when those people come to us, whether they like what they have, where 30 points higher than cable and our net promoter scores are even higher than fiber. On, you also raised the, and we've had this discussion in the past, the amount of synergies from the sprint transaction, where are these synergies coming from and where's their, when does it peak out? Well, the principle place they come from is the network and we achieved a massive milestone in Q3, the substantial shutdown of the entirety of the sprint network targeted sites. So that is behind us now into the run rate synergies we increased in our guidance yet again as a result because that network shutdown happened more than a year ahead of schedule. There's still some room to run into next year, but as we finished 2022, most of those run rate synergies are now in the run rate. Every analyst I talked to on the stream, Mike, they mentioned team mobile is about ready to do a large share buyback. When I talked to highlighted $60 billion potential from 2023 to 2025, are you still on that track? Well, that's what we said in our 2021 analyst day. And yeah, our cash flow production has continued to come in in line with expectations ever since then. And so not only did we get that program started with a $14 billion buyback, but we started it early. And so in 2022, we're actively buying right now with a $3 billion program this year and an $11 billion program in 2023. And that's an expression of the confidence of our management and our board in the future. Before you let you go, speaking of confidence, you struck an upbeat tone on the metaverse on your earnings call. That was a tough day for meta. It's not got slam tough quarter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,60,2022-10-28 18:06:00
4360," Metaverse, we got a mental no-finish icon. I know you're listening in, so just you know. Can I ask you one more thing, though, sauce, you know, when T-Mobile touts itself as having improved its network and is stealing customers from the others, for a while, they're re-reli, and we are still seeing it to some extent. This real promotion wars between the telecom companies. It's costing them, though. I mean, in the case of T-Mobile, what's its outlay look like? What are its margins look like right now as it is trying to get those new customers to join? Because it's trying to offer that value proposition. Well, they've been the only telecom, I would say, over the past year and a half, to consistently raise their profit outlook because their revenue continues to come up to the upside. And they also continue to see billions and dollars of cost takeout or they're reducing costs in those legacy sprint assets. So that's what we heard from T-Mobile last night. They say almost $3 billion of cost-cutting in those legacy sprint operations coming into the year. Maybe they were around $2 billion or so. I mean, that's huge upside for this company. All right. Coming up on the other side. Meanstock Media, huh? Oh, yeah. S3 Partners Bob Sloan will give us his take on volatile stocks next. Thanks...........................",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,61,2022-10-28 18:13:23
4361," on the 10-year yield. So kind of interesting that what we had been seeing now we have been seeing stocks go up and yields go down this week so buying in both on the weekly basis. But today they have reasserted their traditional relationship as it were. I was just talking about the NASDAQ and how sort of surprising it is with NASDAQ with Amazon down by 9%. But if you take a look at the equal weight NASDAQ 100 here, most of the components are in the green. We have Apple of course that is certainly helping matters. It is at its highs of the session now up by nearly 7% after what looked like an initially mixed quarter and was a mixed quarter. But it looks like investors are looking at the bright side here this morning when it comes to those shares. Let's also talk about some of the stocks that we were talking about a lot more earlier in the year. We are talking about meme stocks. Our next guest was one of the few who saw last year's short squeeze of GameStop coming before it happened. And with this company's data analytics can help investors avoid surprises from market structure and hopefully find the next big short squeeze. For more we welcome in Bob Sloan S3 Partners CEO and Managing Partner. Bob thanks for being here. And just because a company has high short interest doesn't mean there's going to be a squeeze. But what are some of the conditions if you will that make a company or a sector or a collection of companies right for action like that? That's a terrific question. The main ingredient to a short squeeze is not the flawed short interest that you will see published on Google. The main ingredient of a short squeeze is how much or short sellers losing and what's the upward momentum price action comes to stock. As they lose more money and you see the price action go higher. That is what causes a short squeeze. That is what S3 calculates and that's why we're one of the most popular data sets in the world when it comes to measuring short interest flow and financing rates. Is there enough short activity right now or short volume or float that's in the market right now to cause anything near the type of scale that we saw at the beginning of 2021? If you look at GME I think there's still a billion two short in the stock. If the stock goes past $30 you could see something parabolic. Bob one of the I would say one of the conditions for the the high to the meme stock rally a lot of people were home during the COVID pandemic. We get a recession next year. Do you think that sets the condition for increased trading activity? One of the things that I mentioned on the Netflix special that was done on GameStop a lot of people have seen that is this idea of Kardashian economics. If you think if you look at the arc the Kardashians are still here. If you look at the arc of that apply it to socially mobilized investing and think that's going to go away. I don't think so. Okay so for some of the other industries that are kind of further out bets and based on some of the more innovative technology there's been more of the how can we say the arc trade if you will. How do you look at some of the sector based or even the innovation based trades right now and considering that there's an alternative trade to even that in the short positions that have flowed in. So there's also selling along positions which is you could argue the equivalent of a short position and one of the things that we have is a new product is looking at market structure and particularly on the long side and if you look at our new product you'll see that meta is the second most popular holding amongst the hedge fund community. What will that do in returns over the next quarter. I think we know the answer already. So those types of stocks when you see persistency and holding over time and you see a down draft in the marketplace you're going to see losses and that will affect where money moves. It affects how different strategies are composed and one of the things that really caught our attention was when Dave and I and Horne came out and said value investing is dead. You know for us that's like a profit coming down from the mountain and throwing away the tablet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,62,2022-10-28 18:17:24
4362," Dave and I and Horan came out and said value investing is dead. You know, for us, that's like a profit coming down from the mountain and throwing away the tablets. You know, it's just heresy, right? So, but what he's saying is that markets evolve. Market structure is very important and it's not just the short side. It's the long side too and our new product's all for that. Bob, I want to go back to what you just said about meta. I see Amazon is also one of the most has the most long positions next to meta. Spell that out for us a little bit more where you were alluding to that. Even after that sharp decline, the 25% drop in meta on a single day basis. Even after the 10% or so drop that we're seeing in Amazon today. Is what you're saying? Does that imply that we could see more people get caught holding the bag and more selling exacerbated going forward? Yes, that's exactly what we're saying. Persistency of long positions quarter of a quarter are quite high. So it is reasonable to assume that since if you look at the hedge fund cohort and see what the largest holdings are, it is very reasonable assume that there are severe losses in portfolios today right now as we speak. Bob, thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. I really appreciate breaking it down and looking through some of the data that you're also tracking. Thank you very much. Absolutely. Guys, coming up, we're going to take a deeper dive into some more earnings reports from Deckers. We've got Colgate palm olives and Gilead sciences. Exciting. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome back everyone. It is time for Cut for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. We are watching Deckers Outdoor after it released a conservative forecast alongside earnings the footwear maker, which owns brands like Uggboots, Hoka.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,63,2022-10-28 18:21:41
4363," That's the long side earnings, the footwear maker, which owns brands like Ugg Boots, Hoka, seeing its stock move despite a quarterly profit beat. They're taking a look at shares down a little more than 5% right now. They said in this quarter that net sales actually increased 21.3% compared to last year and then additionally in their wholesale net sales, that actually increased by about 16.7% here as well with DTC of 35%. When I saw that sales gain, I'm like, wow, maybe they're trying some new stuff. I went right to the Ugg page and they have these moon boots. I haven't seen stuff like this in a while, 320 dollars a pop, but it looks like a new innovation burst over Uggs. No more necessarily those brown shoes and some PSLs and you go out and walk around the hall. I think these. You not seeing what these shoes looked like before? Brown shoes? They didn't look like this. No, but I was going to say Ugg has been making a lot of money. I mean, I go back to high school. I was wondering. They've been, they've already invaded. Well, and the Hoka brand has been on fire for them, right? It's not just about Uggs. Hoka net sales, approaching that of Uggs, $333 million for Hoka, $476.5 million for Uggs. So they're getting up there here. It does seem really the discipline was from that they did not raise their expectations. All right. Sticking with earnings, Colgate, Palmolve, paned by investors after the consumer package goods company, Porte sales missed despite raising prices. This is inflation and a cloud of economic outlook continue. Probably one of the more disappointing quarters from consumer package goods company. But still, another company I think is doing some pretty innovative things. The crest, not the crest, the Colgate whitening pen. Over night whitening pen, it just works. I tried to resell it. It just works. Yeah. All right. I gotta give me one of those. So, isn't it just like whitening at the end? And then you sleep with it. It took a little while to get used to in the store. Just take your teeth. Yeah, very healthy. Yeah. That is a lot of work. I mean, it comes down to how they're moving inventory continuously into some of the store fronts that are the most massive retailers as well. Target, Walmart. And where consumers are also leaning into some of those household name brands versus, perhaps, trying out some of even in the trade down, trying out some of the homegrown brands that are targeting Walmart. What? But the difference here between some of the other consumer brand companies we've heard from, like the Procter and Gamble's, the world is they raised prices enough to offset any volume declines or if not declines and volume slow down. And that doesn't seem to have succeeded enough to the same extent in cold-gate palm olives. One other company to discuss in our little earnings round up here is Gilly Add, the drug maker. It is moving to the upside 10% after reporting better than expected profit from demand for its HIV and cancer drugs. That offset lower sales of the pharmaceuticals COVID-19 anti-viral drug as well as acquisition costs. This represents a pretty impressive move upward here for Gilly Add because it's been having some rocky times in terms of its stock performance. Yeah, Big Tarby putting the team on its back, sales increased 22% year over year but oncology sales, yeah, 79%. As you were talking about there a moment ago here. And then additionally going forward here for Gilly Add, given that they had placed so much of the research and development as well in the novel coronavirus pandemic around some of the treatments, it's going to be interesting to see where some of those patents are able to be leveraged into some of the other treatments moving forward. Yeah, it's just good to see a positive reaction to an earnings report and what has been really challenging week, notably in the tech space. Yeah, so this move upward, the biggest, it looks like the stock is also the highest in, I'm looking at the one year, it's definitely the highest over the past year, probably the highest going back to about mid 2020 for these Gilly Add shares here. And actually now on the one year chart, up 15% interesting here. So, as we look at, as we take a step back, take a little breath here after this busy week of earnings, really we have focused a lot on the technology earnings. And so, as we look back over the week, it really felt like a tough week that really defined some expectations that some of these big tech firms would be more resilient. I think people expected the bad meta-quarter, but aside from that, I think really Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, all of them really disappointing investors. Yeah, I think investors were shell shocked. And this is the really the second, straight quarter for meta that wasn't just disappointing, it was just really, really bad. Just not good. Any line out in the report, not good. No, even with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,64,2022-10-28 18:26:31
4364," I mean, this is the really the second straight quarter for meta that wasn't just disappointing. It was just really, really bad. Just not good. Any line out in the report, not good. You know, even with this week's earnings that we saw, I'm actually glad that we ended with Kili Ad Science's there a moment ago because if you look at some of the year-to-date performers that have actually, not just outpaced the market performance, but actually maintained a positive move over the course of this year, it's companies like Merck. It's some of the United Health Cares as well that are actually positive over the course of the year. So as much as attention, as much attention as we give big tech and for a great reason, it's in the palm of our hands, it's on our screens every single day, it's the different devices that we operate with. It still comes back to what are some of the core elements right now in this economy that people are still going to engage with. It's your energy, it's your health, and then it's all of these other products layered on as well. And that's where the real demand equation and the necessity of communication services as referenced through all of our conversations with AT&T, with T-Mobile and as well with Verizon. So I had to play golf tomorrow? I'm so excited to play with you guys. Me, you Dave Briggs, Senior Communist, Rick Newman, we're in the links, let's pump. I was looking at the interactive. Oh, I didn't know. There's a lot of green on there too. Yeah, it's a red dot. Oh, I was looking at the Dredge Stocks that you were just talking about. See, there you have it, the year-to-date drug action here, Giliad among them, of 6.8% in the year, Eli Lilly, of 30.8% here. So that was really interesting too. I was also looking at the sectors on the week here, communication services, right? That's the big loser. That includes a meta consumer staples, XLP in the upper left there, up 5.9%. So interesting, the weekly action that we have seen. Report, reporter, the week for me, I'll just quickly add McDonald's. Oh, wow. What a quote of print. Donald's coming off October tracking up close to 20% all because these adult happy meals. Wow, big, big, big. Yeah, between McDonald's and Chipotle, we got the food space covered, different consumers, well, that they're going after clearly. All right, we gotta go, you guys. Oh, yeah. We've already, a key coach for Gina and the S-Brace are gonna do a deeper dive into those earnings from Applewood cities, Jim Suga, that's next. The 21,000 wallocide fund.

4365," Come here, son! Make sure so. We'll be right back. This is the layout room please. If you install it, You'll know what you're applying to it. So you know the거든요 Yes, right? Right. Now, let's first touch. I want to give you an overview of monkey's Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita along with and this for right. Here's what we're watching at this hour. Twitter takeover Elon Musk officially taking ownership of the social media platform and fiery top executives right along the way here. Is the saga really over? We're going to discuss in just a bit. It's a tale of two mega caps apple extending its streak of earnings beats. The company posting record revenue even as iPhone sales came in lighter than expected but a different story for Amazon as the e-commerce giant prepares to quote tighten its belt after disappointing results. And we are all about energy on this Friday. The earnings parade continues with oil giants Chevron and Exxon and the marketing and record profits in higher energy prices. We're going to break down those results and then continue our energy chat. We're talking specifically green energy with plug powers chief executive about alternative solutions. First let's check in on the market action things looking good so far. 90 minutes into the trading day with the Dow up 622 points. Take a look at that up nearly two percent. Looking to extend its streak of wins to four straight weeks. The S&P 500 up 622 and the NASDAQ up 193 there despite some of those disappointing results we're talking about coming through this week. Well the big story of the morning Elon Musk is officially taking control of Twitter completing his $44 billion takeover of the social media giant. Tweeting out the bird is freed to mark the start of his ownership of a company. And that start reportedly includes several executives such as CEO Parag Aguahwa and CFO Ned Seagal being let go joining us to discusses Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan and Alex let's start with the shakeups here that have happened already. Not entirely unexpected. Right. But what does this look like moving forward? We're taking a look at the potential payouts that could come. What this could mean for the company. Yes so these top executives so far are entitled to compensation under the merger agreement. They get accelerated compensation so there's a big pay day here. Let's go through what those are CEO Parag Aguahwa and CFO Ned Seagal also being let go. Head of legal policy Vijaya Gadi she's the one who is controversial for banning President Trump. Also banning political ads on Twitter and also had banned that New York post story saying that Hunter Biden had arranged a meeting between his father and Ukrainian businessmen. So these big shifts they're going to cost the company some money. I've read up to $200 million. The numbers are a little bit shaky. But we do know that those three executives together they own 1.2 million shares in Twitter. We're $65 million also under the merger agreement. A golden parachute for accelerated investing of stock worth $119.6 million. They also get one year of salary and benefits. Each of those executives making $600,000 a year plus based salary. So big ticket items here. And now it's interesting that the big executives right there out but we don't feel that sorry for maybe the big ones again. Well quite a bit of a pay out there but what about the employees? Because there had been headlines that 75% of the employees were going to be cut. Then Elon Musk says no. So what happens to the employees, the majority of them at Twitter? So there are reports that Elon Musk did in fact, this is the New York Times saying that he did in fact agree to pay the investing that was coming for the rank and file employees. Now that date is November 1st. So Tuesday a big part of Twitter's workforce was set for a big payday. Estimates are that that payment if Musk does make it will cost approximately $100 million. And there's some-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,66,2022-10-28 18:34:55
4366," Twitter's workforce was set for a big payday. Estimates are that that payment, if Musk does make it, will cost approximately $100 million. And there's some concern, some employees have expressed concern that he won't in fact make those payments because under the language of the agreement, going back to the merger agreement language again, it says that you have to still be employed at the company in order to get those payouts. So that's something to watch. Also- That's some financially too fire then, right? Yeah, it absolutely does. And look, Twitter's ranks have swelled to 7,500 employees over between 2020 and 2021. That was the year a number as of December. And so the company has been adding and adding to its workforce over the past five years. Certainly with that incentive, it might be something that he wants to take a close look at getting rid of more employees. And finally, there are questions here about what this business structure is going to look like. Elon Musk has floated a number of ideas since this offer was first made back in April of this year. Subscription model, you know, sort of getting rid of a number of features. At the end of the day, the business as it stands gets more than 80% of its revenue from ad dollars. So what's going to change there? Yeah, so TBD, right? But what we can know is what was tweeted between Elon Musk and his associates, some of them being friends, some of them business partners, investors in the tweets that we saw, his personal treats that we got through the litigation in discovery that was supposed to happen with Twitter if this deal didn't go through. He had talked a lot about, you know, shifting users, also the amount of content, the type of content that would be permitted on the platform. So certainly, we can expect some more wide-ranging speech allowed on the platform. That's something that he has long said he wants to do. He also says he wants to be able to have it as a forum that does that without inciting violence. Also, that tweet that he tweeted out directly to his advertisers yesterday, he said this, Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape or anything can be said with no consequences. He went on to say that he aspires to make it one of the most respected advertising platforms in the world. So definitely giving a nod to the fact that just anything can't go on Twitter. TBD, as usual, has been the, with this deal with Twitter. Thanks so much, Alexis Keenan. And let's turn now to the latest round of big tech earnings, starting with Amazon. Shares taking a head following a revenue miss in its latest quarter, and weaker than expected results from its Amazon Web Services segment. Amazon also forecasting lackluster fourth quarter revenue, which it doesn't bode well for the holiday shopping period. And this is something interesting that we've watched with Amazon, right? AWS, a little bit lighter than expected. Also, warning about that slowdown, that is significant. A slowdown with consumers going into the holiday season, where the sales expected to grow from 2 to 8%, but that's the lowest in the company in these history. I think that it's important to pay attention to what Amazon is saying about the health of the consumer as we go into the fourth quarter. Yeah, I mean, you could argue that forecast is really what weighed on the stock yesterday. We saw it down significantly after the results, after the bell, falling below that $1 trillion mark, which is pretty incredible when you think about a company that has grown so quickly and significantly, especially during the pandemic. A few comments to note here, I mean, you talked about the slowdown that's expected in the holiday quarter. Obviously, for an investor perspective, a little concerning when you think that's supposed to be one of the strongest times of year. CFO Brian Olsowski saying the company is taking steps in his words, tighten its belts, that includes pulling back on catbacks, pausing, hiring in some businesses, winding down some products and services. So when you think about where Amazon has been since the pandemic began, it really has been about grow, grow, grow, grow, adding more staffing, you know, adding or expanding other facilities and all that. And it feels like things might slow down a bit there, take a bit of a pause because of what they're seeing, especially on their e-commerce side of things. And which is what also we have seen with other companies related to tech as well, where they just take a pause, perhaps a pause with hiring, a pause with perhaps more investments. Also, just want to note, Amazon still has 55 buy ratings and two hold one sell. So you have a lot of analysts that have lowered their price target on this stock, but you still have analysts that consider it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,67,2022-10-28 18:39:12
4367," I buy ratings and two hold one sell. So you have a lot of analysts that have lowered their price target on this stock, but you still have analysts that consider it a buy. Yeah, and when you look at $101, a lot of people may be saying, well, considering where it's binge rating, that may not actually be a bad price to get in on. On a more upbeat note, Apple shares are trading higher after a top estimates for the fourth quarter. But future guidance for the December quarter, looking dim as Apple expects a deceleration in year over year revenue. And this is one of those things. And as when you think about what preceded these results, Apple did just well enough to sort of add some optimism to investors. We're a little concerned about things. But when you think about iPhone sales, I mean, the company touted new revenue records for the quarter in iPhone services, wearables, home accessories, but they didn't come in a little softer than what is expected. The iPhone revenue up 10% year on year, no surprise year, something we were trying to fly yesterday. The dollar strength, a significant headwind for the company. They did fly that yet again, saying in the September quarter revenue was up 8%, but the company faced 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. And that's another thing to continue watching as we see the dollar strength. Yeah, and that's something that other companies, multinationals have also talked about, is that dollar strength. But what I found also interesting was the other products category, including Apple Watch AirPods, that saw increases, that beat Wall Street expectations. But it'll be interesting to see what happens with these types of products if consumers pull back on discretionary spending on these products that may not be as necessary, let's say, as if they were to need an iPhone. Let's bring in another voice into the conversation. We've got Jim Suvaz, city managing director and equity research specializing in technology. Jim, good to talk to you. Let's try to move the conversation forward because we are in that quarter where Apple traditionally has done, has seen the most strength, especially during the holidays. Based on what you heard yesterday, how optimistic are you about what they're likely to see in this quarter, especially with consumers being weighed down by higher prices? Well, Akiko, it's great to see you again, my friend. I got to tell you that's a very smart question. As we approach the holidays, there's a little bit of a headwind happening here of consumers have less discretionary income. Their rent is more expensive, gasoline prices are more expensive, more and more things are expensive. And so we are also seeing a challenge with foreign exchange. When you translate those dollars from the pound or the euro or the yen back to US dollar, it's a big headwind of about 10% to Apple. That being said, we still do expect growth next quarter, probably in the neighborhood of about 4% a year over year growth. Now that seems a little subdued, but when you have 10% of your sale or 10% of your growth being taken away by FX, you add that back. That's actually 14% growth year over year. That's remarkable in this situation, especially in a world where a lot of megatech right now is seeing a lot of pressure. We're very positive on Apple, we think that the platform continues to grow and a lot of new and exciting things in the future, Akiko. Jim, speaking of the consumer, what about the other products? What about Apple Watch? What about AirPods? Those expectations. But if we go into a recession, if the consumer pulls back on discretionary items, are you going to see some weakness there? So Annaz, that's a good observation point, but I got to point out that when people break their iPhone, they find a way to replace them. They may reduce the amount that they're spending on food and beverage or delay some folding purchases, but Annaz, I can also tell you that people will replace their iPhones. Also remember, Apple caters to the part of the market that is not necessarily the emerging markets where people are living a lot more frugal lifestyle. They tend to cater to a people who want a premium experience. And it's worth that software and hardware come together in a wonderful experience that people are willing to pay and premium for it. So Apple would not be immune, but what they do have is a tremendous amount of cash flow where they could buy back a lot of stock. And we're seeing that other tech companies, if we enter a big downturn, they don't have a cash flow generation that Apple does.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,68,2022-10-28 18:43:33
4368," cash flow where they could buy back a lot of stock. And we're seeing that other tech companies, if we enter a big downturn, they don't have the cash flow generation that Apple does. So you've got a valuation support that could help out Apple should things get really bad next year and we're positive on the stock. Speaking of positive, you've got a price target of $175 a share, we're just under that right. Now I think I saw $156 there. What do you think is gonna be the big catalyst that gets you there? And the other question we haven't really tackled yet, how big of a weight we'll try to be as we see things slowing down over there. Well, some of the big catalyst we see is a foldable iPhone or iPad in 2024. But next year's 2023, the people will be looking forward next year to the following year and that will start to get people pretty excited. Also the services, we believe that their services are gonna start to accelerate in 2023 as we lap these difficult foreign exchange comparisons and as they put in price increases, it should help them. So we actually do see these as positive catalyst for 2023, foldable phones in 2024 and a platform that's growing. You'd mentioned I Apple Watch. That's very important. Now people are using it more and more in healthcare and we expect that to continue to grow. We see them getting more and more involved with the enterprise. Simply put, the platform of Apple, which we view Apple as a platform company, not just a hardware company, continues to expand and grow its addressable market. We see a lot of positive things ahead for the company. Yeah, a lot more tentacles there, allowing the company to pull some levers. Jim Sava, as always, great to have you on. City Managing Director and Equity Research specializing in technology. Well, another tech stock we're watching this morning, cost reductions at Intel are helping lift the stock today. It's up more than 10%. This coming despite slumping sales on Q3 and disappointing guidance. The chipmaker saw revenue decline 20% to $15.3 billion in the most recent quarter as demand for PC's softened. The company now expects a revenue of 14 to $15 billion in the current quarter, that is below Wall Street estimates, but it did pledge to slash costs aggressively throughout layoffs and through slower spending on new plants, Intel's now aiming to reduce cost by $3 billion next year, adding up to an annual savings of $10 billion by the end of 2025, and that helping lift the stock today up 10%. Well, coming up big profits from big oil, Chevron and Exxon, both reaping in record profits amid a global energy crunch. We're gonna dive into the oil giants results and discuss the energy sector, with through a security's neilding vent after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,69,2022-10-28 18:48:09
4369," I doubt that even in this helmets, disappointed with the old Nummon King. Let's take a quick look at the markets this morning with personal consumption expenditures data out this morning. That metric closely watched by the Fed. Here with more Yahoo finances, Jared Bligory. Yes, I'm ashamed I didn't get the memo no pink on me, but let's get to the markets here. I want to check the S&P 500 futures here because I'm going to talk about the inflation readings we got this morning, some of the economic data. Here was that 830 release. We got a brief spike up and retracement. But then it was off to the races. Was it because of the below than expected reading an inflation? Probably not. Other things that play here. But I do want to point out the currency situation. US dollar is advancing once again. This is intraday. Let me put this on a three month basis. And you can see this is a second day of gains evidenced by these two green candlesticks here. And we are hovering by what are 20 year highs here, basically going back to 2001. You put a max chart, basically going back to this area here where we saw a 120 high in the DXY. Now, composed of this, we have the US dollar advancing again with respect to the Japanese. And that comes on the heels of the rate decision where they largely stood, stood, pat here, nothing big, no big surprises. But this was the intervention that we got last Friday. And you can see barely having extended. We are still at the bottom of that range. Now, when we had this before in September in two weeks, we were right back up there. So I don't think any of these pressures had peas. We got to look to the calendar next week because we do have an FOMC decision. That's going to come out next Friday, next Wednesday. After that, we have the labor market. We have non-farm payrolls on Friday. That's a big monthly report. A couple of weeks after that, we got CPI. So these are the big things that are moving the market right now. And I haven't even touched on the mega cap earnings, which are also in view here. But I do want to end on something that's affected by currencies. That's the dollar. Excuse me. That is crude oil here. And WTI, you can see, is down about 1.5%. We do have exon-mobile earnings and chevron earnings looking at almost record profits for both exon, definitely the case there. We're going to talk about that in a second, guys. Yeah, let's pick up right there. Thanks so much for that, Jared. Chevron and exon has Jared reported or mentioned reported earnings this morning. And it's no surprise here. The world's largest oil companies crushed analyst expectations. Exon posted almost $20 billion in profit. That is the best result ever for the company. Rival Chevron reported its second largest profit amid increased demand for natural gas. Joining us now to discuss these results is for us managing director for energy research, Neil Dingman. You know, Neil, I feel like every quarter we're saying are we at peak oil? And here we are talking about record profits again. Is this as good as it gets? No, if you simply answer is no. I mean, to call these companies cash cows is probably an entertainment, I think I'd call them cash bulls. You all mentioned the earnings of the profit. We simply, I think the big factor being free cash flow. Chevron had a new quarterly record, almost 11 billion free cash flow. Exon was just a touch under its record. Last quarter still generate over 17 billion in free cash flow. And what's unique about these companies is that they're good in the majority of this from the upstream while having some growth, unlike most of my independence, that are basically seeing no growth. And Neil, this energy crisis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,70,2022-10-28 18:52:22
4370," already this from the upstream while having some growth, unlike most of my independence that are basically seeing no growth. And Neil, this energy crunch that we've seen, so many people talk about it as being something really structural that this is going to go on for years, countries trying to figure out where they're getting their energy from. So if this continues like this, are we going to be seeing more gains for these companies? Yes, I think especially for these diversified, these companies that are not just purely domestic, like obviously the two majors, that if they can open up, Exxon talked about a new, just a recommend of new LNG production, they're talking about, they talked about new carbon ventures. There's just a lot of things that they're going to start doing that. Again, my smaller companies are not going to be afforded to, is they sort of keep production fly it. But the simple answer, I think, is absolutely that. They will try to expand, but the simple answer is domestically as international, especially Europe, the supply is just when it comes to infrastructure is simply too tight. So that, that not the upstream is going to remain the challenge to the midstream. And Neil, it's worth pointing out this number that I thought was pretty incredible here. Exxon in this current quarter is forecast to post full your profit in excess of $50 billion. So if you look at that, that's more than Amazon, Proctor, and Gamble, and Tesla combined. Right? And what a difference a few years makes when you think about where Exxon was before. This is a company, and not just Exxon, but Chevron too. Obviously, that is exposed to these cyclical swings. And obviously, they have had a huge year. But when you think about where they're putting their money, you talked about some investments. They're also reiterating their share by back. I mean, is that a smart use of money when you think about where the lows have been for these oil giants and how far they've had to climb back up? Right. I think the simple answer is they have two choices. You can either expend it externally or as you said, either some sort of share all the return. And most of them, even including the majors, just say, okay, what would it cost me to go buy anything on the upstream midstream infrastructure, new venture side, and on an asset value, what are my shares still trade for? As you said, even with all of the shares like Exxon are basically at an all time high, the simple answer is still a lot of them that their shares are still trading at a significant discount on an asset value. So I still think it does. They're, let me say though, they're not buying back near as much shares and paying near as much dividends as some of the independents, which are paying upwards of 75, 85 and 90% of their free cash flow out. So the majors do keep a much more optionality to do other things. And Neil, Kiko mentioned how these companies have really had to climb from the lows. I mean, back in 2020, you had oil negative. And it's hard to imagine that Chevron, Exxon mobile, now have a bigger market cap than meta. So right now we're watching year-to-date Exxon mobile is up 78%. Chevron's up 52% year-to-date. If investors didn't get into the stock earlier this year, is it too late or how do you see this in the next three to six months, especially if the economy goes into a recession? Sympons, no, it's not too late. And why I say that is I've been talking a lot of investors. And to me, out on the street right now, the biggest variable or the biggest sort of, you know, when you're looking at stocks, I think, is free cash flow yield. And right now, the energy group, even these two stocks today, dominate all their sector. I think right now, in this and T500, of the top 10 stocks and the five end of that seven are EMP companies as far as having the highest free cash flow yield. So I'm definitely aware of the run that all of them had even Chevron Exxon included. But again, to me, it comes down to what the free cash flow yield, what you're able to do with that. And right now, the energy sector still dominates all other sectors in that aspect. Sure, it's managing director for research or energy research, Neil Tingman. Get to talk to you on this Friday. Well, coming up with the Fed expected to raise rates again next week, we'll move to our global recession. And how can investors position their portfolios in a world of 5% interest rates?

4372," Welcome to Yahoo Finance live on this Friday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave breaks. Let's get you up to speed on today's rally as we kick off the final hour of training. You'll get the doubt of just over 800 points. SMP also holding on to gains up nearly two and a half percent. Taking a look at the Nasdaq 100 that's rallying 3% today above 11,500. If you take a look at the action that we have seen over the past five trading days starting with the Dow, you can see the Dow over the last five days up just around five and a half percent on track for its fourth straight winning week. Taking a look at the SMP 500. That's also in the green over the last five days up nearly 4%. The Nasdaq 100 we have certainly seen a wild swings here play out in the tech sectors. We've got a number of disappointing results from some of those larger cap tech names, but despite all that Nasdaq 100 on track to close the week up nearly two percent. Taking a look at some of the action that we've seen playing out in the bond market, the 10-year yield pushing higher once again today back above 4%. You could see the 30-year yield also pushing to the upside right around for 14. Taking a look inside at some of those individual movers, the Nasdaq 100, I mentioned some of the disappointing results. Amazon, their guidance for the fourth quarter, falling short of what the street was expecting. We're seeing that reflected in the move today off just around a seven percent apple on the other hand beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines and really helping to reassure some investors out there that maybe it's not as bad as it had initially seemed for tech, at least for apple to say the least that stuck up just around seven point seven percent today. Take a look at the broader market action as we count down to the final hour of trading all 11 of the S&P sectors trading to the upside technology real estate communication services among the leaders there. Energy also a big story today up just around a half of a percent. If you take a look at some of those individual names, Exxon was out with its earnings report this morning that stock up just around three percent of beating the streets estimates there as well as Chevron. You can see Chevron moving to the upside up just around a six tenths of a percent. Dave, I tell you what it's the weirdest recession we've ever seen. We are headed to one. Let's get you up to speed now on Elon on that little blue bird Twitter is officially his problem and his company closing the $44 billion deal shares are now suspended. Must promptly cleaning house firing CEO Parag Agrawal who reportedly exits with a 42 million dollar pay package. CFO did Seagal also let go with Twitter's policy head and general counsel. Must later tweeting the bird is freed. The SEC confirming the deal and the Twitter is now part of Ex Holdings Inc. Banks including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America agreed to provide the 13 billion in debt financing. Elon also secured seven billion from private equity investors including Larry Ellison as well as the Saudi Prince, former President Trump who some expect to return to the platform celebrating the return of Elon saying it's now in sane hands moments ago. Elon posting another tweet and an interesting one addressing concerns about moderation. Twitter will be forming a content moderation counsel with widely diverse viewpoints. No major content decisions nor account reinstations will happen before that counsel convenes. Let your imaginations run with what Elon will do with Twitter. But let's talk about it with Ray Wong, Consolation Research, Principal Analyst and Founder Ray Goodes. You as always happy Friday sir. Big picture just your reaction to the last couple of hours. Elon closing this deal and promptly cleaning house in the sea suite. Happy Friday. Elon had to take some bold actions and some of those actions was to fire some of the rot that he felt was really happening at Twitter. It's a sign of things to come. But I think the bigger picture is really what's he going to do? What are the next steps? And I think a lot of people have been waiting for that. We've seen the reinstatement of Yeh Kanye West. We've seen the move towards that content moderation board and I think that's a very important first that but there's a whole bunch of innovations that he's going to have to unlock really to get investors to come back and more importantly that people have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,73,2022-10-28 19:05:13
4373," on tent moderation board and I think that's a very important first that but there's a whole bunch of innovations that he's going to have to unlock really to get investors to come back and more importantly that people have faith, especially given the macro conditions of what's happening with digital advertising in social networks. Well, right, digging into that a little bit deeper because I think that is a huge question here. What is going to make this a more compelling investor story laid out. Some of the plans in terms of content moderation also welcoming some people at Kanye West supposedly back to the platform here. What else do you think Elon Musk should do to make Twitter more appealing to investors. Yeah, one of the things that they're going to have to actually figure out is how to actually add subscription services add new service lines. They've got a bolster digital ads with memberships. They also have to take a look at their role in terms of content and content creation, including more creators, more influencers getting them back onto the Twitter platform. They've lost a lot of them over the last period as people go to Insta and Tech Talk. What can they do to jump in? I think that's going to be one of those first challenges. Then the second challenge is really how do we actually get to maybe the super rap that he's talking about. There's probably a lot more regulatory barriers than he probably realizes at this moment that might stop him from being able to do commerce or finance or be able to be like the ultimate like we chat app. But there are opportunities as well to actually build out additional services and capabilities. Commerce or payments might be too hard, but the able to enable commerce and able identification to be used in other areas for transactions. I think that's going to be one area that he could look at. Just some clarity on this Conway, Conway issue because again, that statement said no account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes. Conway's account is now visible again on Twitter. He is not tweeting. So there's a little confusion there. It did reappear today. Is that a coincidence? We're just going to have to wait and see for comment from Elon. But let's talk about two things. Ray, one, you talk about the subscription model. I'm just curious. What would you pay for a subscription model on Twitter? And if big if voices like Kanye Donald Trump even Steve Bannon return to that platform? Is that one advertisers will return to? Well, that's going to be the big question. What is being done to actually bring back advertisers and what might offend advertisers? We're in a culture of this moment where a lot of people are upset. They get offended by other people being on there. And I think what Elon is trying to say is, you know, it's a bigger tent. It's got to be a bigger tent. People might have to tolerate some voices that they might not like. And if advertisers like that are not, we'll have to see what happens. But the content moderation council is there to create those policies. And those policies are going to be able to dictate, hey, here's why you might get a different voice. You might get a different opinion in order to actually create a bigger tent. So I think that's the first part. Services I would actually pay for. Well, you know, I think, you know, being able to create broadcast services are going to be important accounts that actually give influencers a bigger voice. I think they're going to be important places I might play as like analytics and information inside. I want to know trends. Right. I remember back in the day, the Yahoo buzz index right feeling to see the trends of what's hot. What's not be on the aggregate debt. And you know, I might even want to participate in surveys and other areas where my feedback is actually being paid for. And actually being used to improve other product services and consumer goods. And right, what is just one of the big stories playing out in tech of this week. We also heard from a number of the larger cap names. Let's start with meta alphabet. And what we heard at the beginning of the earnings season when it comes to snap and the theme. There is this pullback that we're seeing an advertising spend. We've seen the reaction play out in the names and meta falling over 20%. We saw the reaction in alphabet off just around 7% falling their disappointing earnings anything in their surprise. And why do you think we saw such a severe reaction play out in the market? Yeah, we're seeing a big reaction. And it's really because we have five macro crises that have come together to have not been resolved infection, which is the virus inventory, which has been supply chain inflation. As we've seen interest rates and of course, this invasion none of those have been resolved. And what that's doing is creating a lot of concern in marketing budgets. And what people are doing in every organization is they're tring down their budgets. And this has had digital advertising more quickly than any other area. And so in the case of meta, you know, you look at their market cap. I mean, they're below $99 or $100 for the stock, which is pretty indicative of what's going on. And of course, that spill overhead it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,74,2022-10-28 19:09:34
4374," So in the case of meta, you know, you've looked at their market cap. They're, I mean, they're below $99 or $100 for the stock, which is pretty indicative of what's going on. And of course, that spill overhead at, you know, Google, especially on the YouTube ads. And of course, it spilled over to some of the areas around where Microsoft is playing. And of course, you're going to see some spill over in Amazon's digital advertising. A bit of fascinating week in big tech. You got Amazon trading at its lowest level since 2020. Apple having its best day since 2020. Is there anything to learn thematically from Apple's earnings? Or are they just a safe harbor? Is Tim Cook just a master escape artist? Apple is the only Madonna stock doing well. And they've been a good job in terms of creating a mode. It works this way. You got a 1.2 billion devices. You manage to build services on top of the devices. You've managed to retain customers. They're spending more with you consistently. They're buying new devices across the ecosystem. They've got it down. They're probably the smartest digital giant that's out there. Now overall in the market, it's been crazy. I mean, big tech stocks have lost 550 billion this week. I mean, we've lost 3.5 trillion since November. We're down 3.5 trillion since 2022. But we're down 10 trillion in market cap since November 2021 when valuations were set up in a very very very different light. And so this is having a lot of spill over. But there is something to learn. I think it's really important. We just did a customer business confidence survey and what people are investing in are analytics, automation and AI, and there's a series of enterprise tech stocks that have been doing well from service now to Oracle because they're playing in those areas. Right. You quickly mentioned Matana there and you said Apple was the only one holding up also in that group is Microsoft Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia and Amazon. Are you still, I guess, does that investment thesis still stay intact then? Is that still holding up in terms of names that you like or how has that changed because of these results? It hasn't changed for a long term investor. You can see like the pull back that's been going at Microsoft and Alphabet today. It's because the cloud services business is amazing. If you're in it for the midterm to the longterm, this is probably a great buying opportunity. We might be at the bottom. We never know. We can predict that. But it sure looks at it this way, especially giving some indications of where the Fed is with interest rates as a really good friend of mine calls it. This has been the world's biggest margin call. And you know, I think we're done with the margin call. Now we got to figure out where we are with earnings. Is valuations of the hit? Can we sustain earnings? If we can sustain earnings, we will avoid the credit crunch and of course the unemployment and of course the hit on the housing market going forward, which is typically how recessions fall in terms of the domino effects that happen. Well, for the broader market, it looks like at least for now, they're able to shake off some of those underwhelming results that we have gotten in the tech space this week. Ray Wong, always great to have you. Thanks so much. Hey, thanks a lot. Happy Friday. You too. Well, we are just going to be starting to hear on Yahoo Finance live coming up more on the follow-up from Elon Musk's Twitter takeover, find out what the future could look like for the social media giant. With the World Series beginning tonight, we speak with Major League Baseball's Chief Revenue Officer. And Amazon shares falling sharply, falling a disappointing earnings result will break down what Amazon's report could be telling us about other retailers heading into holiday shopping season. All right. It's grateful to you for giving me the privilege to be playing",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,75,2022-10-28 19:14:08
4375," She didn't do it with Arita, did anything for me? I'm not kidding, so it's probably something, right? Amazon. Jerry's taking a pretty big hit today falling on week sales guidance for its very important holiday quarter. So what does this tell us about the state of retail heading into the holiday season for that we want to bring in Jerry's storage storage advisor CEO and former Toys R Us CEO. Jerry, it's great to see you say Amazon guiding between 140 to 144 billion. The street was looking for 155 billion. But the question to you is what does this tell us about the holiday shopping season? Could it potentially be weaker than maybe we initially thought? Well, I thought it's going to be weak for quite a while and I need to just confirm the evidence of that. Retailers have mountains of unsold inventory from weakness earlier in the year and you know they started all the holiday sales early. But history shows it's really difficult to grow the holiday just by starting the sales earlier. So they probably pulled some sales forward into early October. Now we've got the election sucking up all the oxygen. Then we'll come out of it. But by and large, the reality is it's going to be their promotional holiday season. The consumer is clearly weakening when you look at the data with inflation rising so rapidly in the sessies like food and gasoline. A lot of money is going to those kinds of things and people are simply having to spend more to get the same thing. So it's going to be a tough holiday season. You see warnings from everyone's like I'm a town. I mean toys have always held up well during holidays, but they're saying they don't think so this year. That it's going to be pretty tough and has were already has reported some some weak numbers there. So I think Amazon's number is just confirming that this is going to be a difficult holiday. Does that have a positive consumer story and a deflationary story for the economy, Jerry? Well, if you mean because everything's on sale, that certainly works to some degree. To do it, but what you're seeing is there's just massive numbers of units that are selling at this, you know, at this very, you know, diminished price, but it's not necessarily what people want. I was heartened. I'm an Apple shareholder like I think almost everyone in the world is one way or the other, right? But heartened by Apple success. You see if people will pay for what they want. The problem is retailers have all these products. People do not want. And so, you know, the question is how much do you have to put them on sale before you sell something nobody wants? And I think we're starting to start to find out the answer to that. So I think it's going to be difficult regardless. It certainly adds some deflationary impact that you have all this inventory that has to be cleared. But when you look at the data, it doesn't appear to be overwhelming this, again, this double digit increase in necessities in food. You know, gasoline, we've, you know, it's down versus where it was already in the air, but it's still up high double digits versus last year at this time. So you have a lot of, and housing has gone to, gone literally through the roof and here's a prices and obviously interest rates are rising by fed intention. So we see the consumer having to spend their money on a lot of things other than holiday gifts. And from retail, retailers perspective, they're also dealing with the stronger dollar, worker shortages from your view from the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,76,2022-10-28 19:18:28
4376," So we see the consumer having to spend their money a lot of things other than holiday gifts. And from retail's perspective, they're also dealing with their stronger dollar, worker shortages. From your view from the checks that you've made, have these situations improved at all, specifically the worker shortages? I don't think the worker shortage is improving very much. The supply chain issues have mitigated some web, but of course that's because retailors are slowing down their purchases with all of this gluttoned inventory out there. And with what most of them have, which is a very subdued outlook for the holiday season at this point, again, they're very few other than some of the luxury brands, very few retailers who are saying, wow, this is really fantastic. It's getting the best year ever. You get some good reports out of people like some of the food companies, some of the CPG companies, but that's exactly what we're saying. They're raising their prices and consumers, their necessities, or people view them as such and they get good numbers out of those sectors. Jerry's picking a bloated inventory. Zididas has a very interesting inventory issue with loads of Yeezy merchandise. Their signature product, what do you expect them to do with it? And what does the comeback story for a brand that's so closely identified some with someone that they had to cut ties with? Is it similar to what Nike would have to do with God forbid they ever had to cut ties with the Jordan brand? I have to say, I don't know what's going to happen to the inventory that's been produced and not sold in the old days, which is totally unacceptable these days. They probably would have dug a hole in the ground and dumped it in there. That's happened more than once in the history of retail to an unsailable product where it's just cheaper to dump it than it is to sell it. Maybe let's try to strip the badging of it and sell it on ultra-discarded channels. There's always somewhere in the world or someone who will buy something. So they'll get rid of it, but it's especially worthless inventory at this juncture. A dentist has been trolling for a long time that predates this issue. That Nike has been so clearly number one in the space and done so much better than they have. And this was one bright spot in their world. And they're going to have to take a clean sheet of paper and say, where are we going to do now? Because they had a problem before this and now it's doubled down. When Jerry, if you were the CEO of a dentist advising him right now, how would you navigate this issue? Because there is backlash clearly that a dentist had waited so long to cut ties with Kanye West or was the hashtag boycott a dentist that was trending on Twitter last weekend. Do you think those types of, I guess, issues are going to linger here with the company for quite some time? Not, I really don't. I think they took the tough action. And it's easy for some people to say, hey, we won't do business with them anymore. We thought a big part of your business. It was a bold step. And I think a strong statement on a dentist's part. And I commend them for it to take the action that they did. So I think that'll vanish in terms of the concern. What they need to do is find product people want to buy and sell that. And that's where they've been struggling, at least compared to Nike. I mean, Nike has just been spectacular. Let's be honest. And as we were just talking about, even they have inventory problems, right? And they said, oh my gosh, we have all the stuff that didn't sell it earlier plus all the stuff we ordered that all came in at once. And now we're way over inventory. So I think we're facing a very, very difficult period as we look forward here. No one seems immune. No, and when you look at it, it's not a surprise. I mean, it's, look, we all, I'll talk at least one economics course, right? And you know, you can't just keep spending money and not expect it to generate inflation. And the only tool that we're using right now to mitigate this is rise is increasing interest rates. And clearly low interest rates and lack of fed policy was one factor leading to inflation. But we all know it was also the COVID pandemic supply chain issues, worker shortages. And government spending all over the world, not just in the US, but massive government spending that led to the kind of inflation that we're seeing right now. And if we were a different country other than the US and didn't have such a sort of a bedrock currency, if we were grease or something, people would say, you have to cut your spending and balance your budget if you want to get inflation or under control, right? Well, we're never going to do that. That's all we do is just keep raising interest rates until eventually the only thing that can happen is that we plunge ourselves into a real old fashioned recession.

My pleasure. All right, coming up, it's almost 5 o'clock on a Friday. So what better time to talk beer and shares of ABN Bev up more than 1% on this Friday on strong Q3 earnings, the company CEO joins us next with Brian Sousy. Thank you. ABN Bev raising its guidance saying beer sales have accelerated Brian Sousy as a CEO of the world's largest brewer in studio over to you, Sousy. Thanks, Sean. Yeah, join me right now is ABN Bev CEO, Michelle Ducarus. Good to see you. Good quarter from you guys this week. Is this just revenge partying in its finest form? Good seeing you. And thank you for having us. No, I think that is more business momentum. That is cutting across the different geographies that we have. And it's building as we execute our strategy. And of course, consumers are celebrating and having more cheers everywhere. Yeah, no, there's a lot to celebrate. It's getting out of our houses after two years. But, you know, there's a lot of concerns, economic concerns, the economy around the world is slowing. Or your global brand, of course. How does that impact your demand? So beer as a category is very resilient. And if I would say to date what we've been seeing is beer is growing globally. Volumes are up. It's gaining share of throat. So this, this growth comes from beer, taking from other alcoholic beverages in different markets. And as you know, beer is an affordable item.

I know you're very excited about the World Cup. What is a sales estimate? Do you have a sales estimate on how big the World Cup could be to your business? So first and foremost, I'm excited because I'm a fan as billions of people are there. And as serious as that, we are talking before. We were talking before. You see it serious. I love the games. But clearly, it runs deeper than that. I love the games. They're going to be there watching as many other fans across the globe. And it happens every four years. Is the biggest sports event on Earth. I think that this year we have a totally different connotation because of post pandemic. If you travel around, if you go to sports events this year, you cannot have a ticket, right? So it's all fully sold. I think that FIFA will be also big. We are activating 70 countries. In the years that we have FIFA, usually, our volumes go up between 0.7% and 1% for the year.

Lastly before that you go it's five o'clock somewhere. All those viewers on the AlphaFinds platform brought it looking for that cold one. What's your favorite beer? I know you must get asked that all the time. I like beer, period. Every time that I need to go for one I love Budweiser and after moving to the US and having the chance to live here and work with a B and the colleagues here, Mikhail Obolytra is another outstanding one but I love beer Budweiser is the one that they prefer the most.

Unlike rivals of meta and snap, find out why next. Time for triple play three stocks that we are watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. Gilead Intel and Pintra. My pick today is Gilead. Chairs getting a big boost on strong earnings. And also a couple of analyst upgrades. Gilead's third quarter results, topping expectations and the biotech giant up its guide and sales for the court.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,80,2022-10-28 19:35:47
4380," getting a big boost on strong earnings and also a couple of analyst upgrades. Gilead's third quarter results, topping expectations in the biotech giant up its guide and sales for the quarter was $7 billion down slightly from $7.3 billion a year ago. But Piper Sandler and JP Morgan both upgrading the stock to overweight from neutral wild truest up to its rating to buy and lifted its price target to 91 a share about 12 bucks higher from where we're trading today. The newest is bullish on Gilead's oncology pipeline which is says will continue to grow over the next 18 months. If you take a look at today's jump just around 13 percent year to date though the stock still it looks like it's actually holding onto gains up just around 17 percent. That's right and I'm looking at the Wi-Fi interactive where I have a one year chart up and we can see this nice rounded bottom and we have accelerated to the upside right there. And if you take a look at a max chart that you can see, this is one of those biotech stocks that has really gone sideways for a number of years, you can see spiking about what 2014, 2015 coming down and just consolidating literally over the last five years. So are we gonna eventually break out from this four to five year trading range? We will have to see. Now, my stock is Intel having its best day since March of 2020 up about, let's see, that's 10 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 and that says the chip maker beat on third quarter profits, EPS coming in at 59 cents versus estimates of 33 cents but it was a slight mis on revenue, even worse, the company really turned heads after slashing its profits and sales forecast for the quarter and for the year far below that which was forecast on the street. Nevertheless, you see it's green there as our all chip stocks basically shareholders seem to like the aggressive cost-cutting measures, $3 billion in cuts scheduled for 2023 alone and CEO Pat Gelsingharko, he has in store more to manage the cyclical downturn in semiconductors. On this note, Jeffries is commenting quote, Intel's cost-cutting plan not only has potential to drive a $1.50 to the bottom line but also ship the company culture to a leaner, more efficient mindset. And Jeffries by the way has a hold rating on the stock with a $28 price target. I'm gonna do a little technical analysis mumbo jumbo here. I wanna put a max chart on, so that, oh, let me try this one more time, max chart in, so you can see that it never eclipse those highs of the dot-com boom. Now it is coming back to Earth as it did 20 years ago. History repeats or rhymes, Dave. Well, they won't be that bad. Really interesting and that the cuts are the catalyst here and what Pat Gelsingharko told Carl Keaton here this morning that the CHIPS Act is the most seminal piece of US industrial policy since World War II calling it a profoundly important step. So they're cutting their way to win here but they're spending $20 million on that CHIPS factory in Ohio, they're building one in Germany. And if that statement proves to be true, well then then we can all feel optimistic more so than the cuts about the long-term viability of Intel and Nvidia and AMD. And that will be the question. How influential is the CHIPS Act? Cause they're all down quite considerably since that was passed. All right, my play is Pinterest. Despite an ad store brewing the stock is soaring on their Q3 earnings, Pinterest beating on both earnings per share and revenue returning to both user growth in the period after three straight quarters of decline. Global monthly active users rising 2.8% to 445 million above estimates. Revenue grew 8% year over year on a loss of $65 million. Now this as I said, bucks the trend of a very tough week for the sector. One that saw meta fall more than 20% to its lowest level since 2016, set Pinterest seat, yo, bill ready on the call really focusing on younger users of the platform. Quote, Gen Z gets something on Pinterest that is distinct from what they get on other platforms, namely a place to discover with intent and purpose and to explore their creativity. Shares of Pinterest up more than 12% a welcome sign rainbow in this storm of social media stock. Still down though, more than 30% year to date, guys. Yeah, Dave, they have a ways to go in order to get back to where we were just around 11 months ago, but we can take a look at today's reaction. You can really see how much Pinterest stands out from some of its competitors out there. We certainly have seen a big pullback. The ad spending that has been reflected in the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,81,2022-10-28 19:40:00
4381," Take a look at today's reaction. You can really see how much Pinterest stands out from some of its competitors out there. We certainly have seen a big pullback. And all the ads spending that has been reflected in the drops that we have seen from Snap or what we have seen from Meta. So for this week, but Pinterest, the outlier here, really performing better than expected Keybank, calling these results, quote, inspiring amid a depressing environment. So some excitement today will see whether or not that holds, though, for this quarter. But coming up, President Biden and Exxon Mobar in a bit of a war of wards we have of the details after the break. President Biden going after big oil once again responding to Exxon CEO Darren Woods's comments on investor payouts tweeting earlier today. Can't believe I have to say this, but giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for American families. We want to bring in Rick Newman for a little bit more on this. And Rick, we know Exxon reporting another record profit this morning, President Biden, has been very critical of some of the bigger oil companies over the last several months. And once again, doubling down on his criticism. Right. And he said this in response to Exxon mobile CEO Darren Woods who said in a prepared statement, I'm surprised this was in a prepared statement, but he said, I'm paraphrasing what we are giving back to the American people. We are raising our dividend this quarter and they did raise their dividend from 88 cents a share to 91 cents a share. So their dividend, I believe, is the second highest in the S&P 500. But of course, Biden's point is, well, that's great for Exxon shareholders. What about everybody who's not an Exxon shareholder? So I guess Exxon thinks everybody should go out and buy a share of two of Exxon. It's about a hundred and I think 115 bucks a share right now. And Biden says no, instead of raising the dividend, what you should be doing is cutting prices so people can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,82,2022-10-28 19:44:26
4382," Well, instead of raising the dividend, what you should be doing is cutting prices so people can save money at the pump. But look, these are cheap shots on both sides, companies like Exxon. They're not going to cut their prices below market price just because they get political pressure to do so. And I would point out that there are a lot of other really profitable companies, and you hardly ever hear President Biden saying that apples should cut the price of an iPhone because communications are too expensive or anything like that. So I think in the oil and gas industry, they're used to being an easy target. And I think it's fair to say actually I'm not going to cut its prices below market prices. It's going to keep doing what it's been doing for decades, which is returning that money to shareholders. You know, I think it's another profound example, Rick, of just how big a megaphone Twitter is and that Elon has some opportunities there if he can monetize that. But anyway, gas price is certainly a political football as is the US debt ceiling, which may be back on the hot burner pending results of the midterms. What lies ahead? The debt ceiling is going to have to be raised again, probably sometime in the middle of 2023. And Kevin McCarthy, who would probably become speaker of the house, if Republicans do take control of the house as expected, he has suggested Republicans are going to return to their old tricks on the debt ceiling, which is when they do have the power to obstruct budget bills in Congress to hold up extending the debt limits while they dicker over some other priority, which would be cutting consumer spending, cutting government spending or could be doing something about the soaring cost of Medicare and Social Security. So this raises the specter that we could once again go back to the days of debt ceiling showdowns where everybody's fretting over what will happen if the treasury can't pay the government's bills and all this kind of stuff. That could happen, but there is another thing that could happen, which as if the Republicans do win on November 8th, then there could be a some kind of bill in the lame duck session, which is between November 8th and when the new Congress comes into the beginning of January, that would raise the debt ceiling, preempting that kind of fight. And there have been a couple of serious economists who say, what kind of should do, just raise the ceiling to $100 trillion. In other words, just make it irrelevant. Some people want to get rid of the whole thing. So we'll have some really entertaining politics in 2023, Dave. Oh, boy, entertaining if you want to call it that. All right, senior columnist Rick Newman. I'll see you on the golf course tomorrow, sir. Good, man. Thank you. All right. Coming up, a new era begins at Twitter. Stay tuned to find out what changes Elon Musk. May you have up the sleeve. Thanks. Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,83,2022-10-28 19:48:46
4383," stretching The bird is freed. That's what Elon Musk tweeted upon closing the $44 billion Twitter deal that's dominated the headlines now for several months, Musk promptly firing the CEO, CFO, policy head, and general counsel. So what's next for the blue bird? Dan is the managing director and senior equity analyst at WEDD Bush, always good to see you, Dan. So let's first start with this. How much is Twitter worth and two? What is it two for? If forced to pay for Twitter, how much would you pay per month? Well, first of in terms of what Twitter is worth today, I mean, I think it's worth 20 to 25 billion. And so this just comes down to, I think it's going to be one of the most overpaid, you know, expensive M&A transactions and tech probably next to AOL time Warner, okay? In terms of what he's paying relative to the fair value that we see. Look, and when you talk about monetization, I mean, that's going to be the issue. I mean, Twitter pervasiveness has never been the issue. It's how do you monetize it? And that's going to be the problem for Musk. The easy part for Musk was buying Twitter, the hard part fixing it. Well, then let's talk about fixing it because he's taking some steps over the last 24 hours. A couple of the top executives are gone. He also announced that he's forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints. I was in a tweet that he just posted a couple of hours ago, but what do you think's in store? What changes do you think need to be made? And it's a bouncing act. I think part of the problem is you're trying to get more advertisers on. You want the power users to continue to come up. But then you got to make sure that from a content perspective, it's not accessible. Because if that's where it becomes, then ultimately that's been part of the problem for Twitter. It's going to be this tightrope that he's going to have to walk. That's why when he talks about the WeChat tight model, the super app in terms of what they have in China over the next three, four years, that's a great vision. But in the near term, it's going to be cost-cutting. It's probably going to be more monetization of the core power users and trying to get more advertisers on the platform. But it's to carry it in the stick. You need engagement and subscribers in what right now is just the perfect storm for digital media. A dramatic, do you think, the head count reduction isn't? You talk about advertisers. Do they want back on a platform if it does indeed welcome former President Trump, Kanye West, Steve Bannon, and the like? I mean, to your latter point, that's part of the problem. That's why I think he put that tweet out today. I mean, otherwise, if you want to spend $44 billion just to make it a town hall and a free fall, then you can do that, right? But I think that's really the issue in terms of that balance that he's trying to strike. And I think overall, when you look at the situation here, I mean, the head count cuts are going to be massive. I mean, this is one, because of the debt, you're now going to have to, from a free casual perspective, service that debt puts more pressure on cost cuts. I see 30% on the low end, probably 40 to 50% on the high end. So Dan, of course, that begs the question what that's going to do for the culture of Twitter. What that means for Elon Musk concerned there about reputation and his management style. What's your take on that? I mean, you couldn't find in the world two different cultures than Musk and then the Twitter culture. I don't see too much pink pong going on during lunch with Musk running Twitter. And I think that's, look, that's the issue is that it's work for Tessa and it's work for SpaceX. That's why it's rich person in the world. But now let's try to make sure morale, keeping employees, resumes not going out, you know, in terms of surge, there's going to be clear cuts. And I think that's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,84,2022-10-28 19:53:01
4384," But now it's trying to make sure morale, keeping employees, resumes not going out, you know, in terms of surge. There's going to be clear cuts. And I think that's really going to be the balance that he's going to need to find to get Twitter through this next chapter. I view it as just a kill, a majority like that feel bad all to turn this thing around. I don't want to turn a little bit to the whole week in Big Tech Dan. Biggest story of the week to you in terms of what we're learning, whether it's Microsoft or Amazon, Meta being hammered, or Apple just proving resilient, let again. I think there's a few things. You know, first Facebook met, I mean, that conference called probably one of the worst I've heard 22 years doing this on the street. I mean, look, right now it's Zuckerberg. It's like a head striker in the movie airplane. I mean, that's sort of the vibe. I think that most investors were getting because you're betting on the Metaverse. It's three to five years down. Right now social media and their massive headwinds. So I think that's one that can continue to sell off cloud. Still holding in well, obviously some cracks that we saw with the Amazon and Microsoft. The one that comes out smelling like roses again, it's Cupertino and Cook. I mean, they're the one where demand continues to be firm. And I think in large pack pack, I really think Microsoft and Apple are the ones are going to begin more dollars. Take a look at Apple. Obviously a huge quarter here of the holiday quarter of the streets and press with their most recent earnings. Looking though ahead to growing their services business. We know they just up their prices on their subscription services. How big of a boost do you see that being to Apple here over the next couple of quarters? Yeah, it's a great point because I think the big part with Apple in terms of the valuation is that services business. You need that to re accelerate. Just forget currency percent because that's about 1000 bit pedwind back to organic double digit year of year. And I think if you start to get there and I believe there's that big opportunity right now. Services is still 25 30% penetrated. You have that golden install base. That's really it's ability, especially the iPhone 14. Still look strong in terms of overall demand now going to the holidays season, but services is the crocs. I mean, you need that to really re accelerate organically. You know, I think for the street to really start to believe that this is one that can navigate the storm. Last night a huge step forward in what's been a nightmare in Elm Street week for a big pack. And what we learned from Amazon about what lies ahead? I think they definitely have some significant not just cuts, but I think they're trying to figure out the new normal. On the e-commerce side, clearly you're seeing some softness going into the holiday season. You still have that COVID hangover that they're going from a growth perspective. And I think there could be some net share games that Microsoft's going after with Amazon on cloud. But you look at the reaction today stocks down 6.5% last night. It was down 20% after hours. The streets starting to realize now Amazon maybe they've cleared the deck low enough numbers. Now you can start to buy the stock. I think you're seeing a similar theme in some of these big capped tech meta you put by the side just because that's more of a train wreck situation. But I do believe some of this the bar so what a worse situation to buy it in terms of where we start to go through in terms of numbers over the next three to six months. Daniel, rep in the Penn State strong a 15 point dog tomorrow against Ohio State. What's your prediction? Well, come here and stay college. I'm obviously this is by the best Ohio State team I've seen 20 years. I think we could there could be a shocker in state polished bar. I think Penn State could win this game. Oh, can't wait for that. What happened? You know what Dan is doing this weekend. Enjoy it, sir. I'm here in state college yet. That should be a fun one. Dan is from WED Bush. Good to see you, sir. Go nitty-lions coming up.

Off he go, On the cell home. On the chest, right best. On the chest. On the chest. On the chest. On the chest. on the chest. support equities at Rally that we've seen recently. Let's take a look also at the sector action because we are looking at all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 in the green with technology there, gaining the most and over on the NASDAQ, a big day for tech stocks, a big week for tech stocks, Apple up seven and a half percent. Here's a closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Certainly some reason to cheer the close on this Friday ahead of Halloween is spectacular performance. Let's check out the numbers on the market, see, Dow, you got it four straight weeks in the positive and 828 point close up, 2.6 percent. Look at the NASDAQ. It's been a wild and tumultuous week in big tech up 2.87 percent when 300 points in S&P also turns in a winner up nearly two and a half points. We got a string of brutal Fridays. Now in the rearview mirror, let's talk about it with Dan Griffith, Huntington, private bank director of well strategy, and Ryan Naman, Zephyr Market Strategist, good to see you both. So Ryan, let's just start with those numbers. We just saw what do you make of that rally to close a wild week. At first, thank you for having me on and happy Friday.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,86,2022-10-28 20:02:01
4386," So Ryan, let's just start with those numbers we just saw. What do you make of that rally to close a wild week? At first, thanks for having me on and happy Friday. Yeah, it was really kind of a surprise because over the past three weeks, equities have performed very well, but in a lot of that was due to tenure yields decline. And if you follow yields, yields have declined in equities of rally. Well, that was opposite today when yields rose at one point above 4% the tenure did. And typically that's bad news for equities, but that wasn't the case today. As equities, as you said, had a really strong day. And that could be with the US dollar, as you mentioned earlier, the US dollar came down a little bit. So that also was a relief to equities. But I found that big rally today, a little bit of a surprise, considering that yields also rose. And Dave, what do you make of the fact that the market's still rallying today despite the weak earnings that we got from Amazon yesterday? When we saw massive losses in meta, the Dow actually ended the day in the green, really showing that stocks are becoming less reliant on tech. But what is this signal to you as we look at the curve quarter and then out to 2023? Well, I think we are in the midst of earnings season. And although we've had some really big headline numbers come in, a little bit lower or significantly lower in some cases, one thing to remember is almost 70% of the folks reporting half come over and have beaten estimates. And I think that shows a real underlying strength in much of the, many of the sectors out there, obviously we saw green in all of them today. But including those outside of the technology area, I think a lot of them have a really good story to tell, even if it's not one that always makes the headlines. Right, 550 billion shed from big tech in a week. It's been a stunning one. I want to kind of give you free for all, whether it's Amazon or whether it's Apple or whether it's Alphabet, Meta, or even the GDP number on Thursday. What was the biggest story of the week that tells you what's coming next? Yeah, for me, I look at the economic stories. We had a solid GDP for third quarter coming in at 2.6 on a resilient consumer spending. You also have the employment cost index. While remaining historically high, the growth has slowed a little bit. It grows 1.2%. And then you have the PCE index or the Fed's preferred inflation rate today. It remains stubborn. And when you take those three into consideration, you're looking at the Fed supporting at 75 basis point hike next week. And potentially another 75 basis point hike in December, when you look at these economic data points that they follow that inflation isn't going to be coming down materially anytime soon. Dan, what do you think? I think the 75 next week is pretty much a sure thing, but looking out into the December meeting back of America saying that they expect maybe the Fed to signal that it's going to slow in December, what are your expectations? I think we agreed that 75 is definitely something that's going to happen here next week. But beyond that, I think we still think we're looking at some strong numbers. Obviously, the Fed's done some stuff this week to, and last week, to point towards a 5% number, which ultimately could be a good place to land. There's a lot going on in the economy that kind of points both directions towards a little bit of a slowdown next year. Obviously, unemployment numbers are really good and the consumer numbers are high. And you just mentioned are both bright points. But a lot of increasing inventory inventories are a little bit of a problem. And some of the other leading economic indicators still would leave some area for the Fed to continue to raise. So Ryan, all the factors that we just took into consideration, what's the strategy you move forward? Yeah, that's the million dollar question, right? And I think you have to build portfolios that are resilient to a recession. Like Dan said, I think 2023, we're looking at a slowdown and most are expecting a recession, whether it's mild or moderate recession. I think you have to focus on high quality dividend and pain stocks that have a quality balance sheet, free cash flow. Look at those high quality names. Also look at sectors that are a little bit more defensive, like consumer staples, health care.

4387," Look at those high quality names. Also look at sectors that are a little bit more defensive, like consumer staples, health care. And also, if you have a really conservative investor, maybe focus on utilities, but you have to look at building a resilient portfolio that can withstand an economic slowdown. Dan, what about you? What are you liking in this environment? No, I think a lot of good points there, Ryan. Obviously, we're talking to clients a lot about kind of nibbling a little bit, taking those names that they feel very comfortable with. And being patient, really looking at what they believe in longer terms. So we're doing a little bit of bond buying right now, and obviously a little bit of very strategic stock purchasing. As I mentioned before, there are plenty of really good stocks that are performed really well. And a lot of people out there, especially in that middle market, small cap area, who are very optimistic about what their numbers look like long term. So we're not jumping in, but we're certainly not telling people not to stay entirely on the sidelines. And Ryan, when you take a look at the strength of the consumer right now, obviously we've had a couple of mixed results, especially when you take a look at Amazon, Amazon warning, or really coming up short when it comes to fourth quarter guidance, raising some concerns here, because it's a very important holiday season. What does this tell us about the strength of the consumer and maybe the weakening that we're starting to see on that front? That's a great question. And no interest rates, as we know, it's a leg on economic data, the consumer. And so on. And that's what we're seeing here. Third quarter, consumer was strong, and showed a willingness to continue to spend. But we're seeing the impacts of inflation and higher interest rates or tightening financial conditions. And that's what these corporations are starting to foreshadow moving forward. Is that economic growth, their earnings are going to slow, because the consumer is going to start feeling it, do the inflation and higher interest rates moving forward. And I think that's where you see Amazon, Apple, and some of these companies giving some warnings for quarter four. Right, Norman, Dan Griffith, great to have you. Have a great weekend. Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. Well, we were just talking about earnings. So let's take a step back, because as we look at some of the big themes from this very busy earnings week, Jared Blickery is joining me here in studio to break down some of those themes. And Jared, let's start with dividends and buybacks. And what we've heard over the past five trading news. Yes, well, dividends and buybacks. Perfect story is Exxon Mobile just released its results this morning. They up their dividend to $0.91 per share from $0.88 per share. And they reiterated a lot of their guidance. Now, they ended the quarter with $30 billion in cash. And that's where they want to be. Now, President Biden has criticized the oil industry, not singling out anybody in particular, but about not returning profits, or excuse me, not keeping profits from the American people. So I think Exxon's point this morning, they even set out right. We are returning profits to American shareholders. Get that right there. But we also know it's not just the energy companies. It's also big tech companies like Apple, Amazon. I have some figures from Apple here. They had a $3.7 billion worth of dividends. That is our heat map here. Let me just put a chart of Apple, so we can see that. Apple down 12.3% over this year. And here's a chart. Let me get to some of these figures here. $3.7 billion in dividends over the quarter. It's $25.2 billion in open market repurchases. So just a shy of $30 billion for Apple. Now, you look at that chart there. It is mostly maintained. It's gains over the last three years. And you probably wouldn't be too critical. Even Amazon. Let me pull up a chart of Amazon as well. Now, it had a bit of a stumble today. You can see not quite right up to snuff in terms of that support line. But Amazon ended the quarter with $10 billion potentially in buybacks. I wish it committed $6 billion to buybacks. And they also have another $6.1 billion to go. Then I want to turn our attention to meta. Now, meta is another story. You can see down 70.5% over the year. And really just slicing through a number of support levels. We'll get this. And $48 billion since the mid-level of 2021 at $300 per share. And that seems to be an overpayment for some of that stock right there. So these criticisms come to light when companies stumble. And a perfect example is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,88,2022-10-28 20:10:21
4388," per share and that seems to be an overpayment for some of that stock right there. So these criticisms come to light when companies stumble and a perfect example is IBM. You can do share repurchases year after year after year, but it's only after that finally hits the bottom line and it realizes and shareholders realize this is a huge mistake with 2020 hindsight that this comes to the forefront. All right, so let's talk a bit more about buybacks. I have a new law taking effect next year that will tax them at 1% goldmins as they estimate they'll top a trillion dollars the largest on record. What's the larger trend there? Well, the larger trend is we're probably going to see fewer buybacks because of this tax at least a little bit. Now 1% doesn't seem like a blot, but it does on the margins and when you're talking about some of the largest marginal buyers of stock which are oftentimes corporations themselves, this does matter. Now why don't they just funnel this into dividends? Dividends can be taxed at a rate of up to 20%. And so that matters in terms of investors. Now goldmins saying in terms of this year, not next year when that law goes into effect, but this year for the rest of the year, four and a half to five billion dollars going to be spent every day by corporations buying back stock. So that is a huge tailwind for equities. Doesn't mean that it's going to overcome everything that we've seen, but given the fact that we're off that we are coming out of a blackout window because of earnings that are ongoing here when companies release the results, well, then they can go back and buy back their stock after that. So that's kind of where we are right now. So with this window opening, we're going to see that tailwind as tailwind apply to US stocks. All right, Jared. Blickery good stuff. Good to see you. My man, have a good weekend. Up next, diesel gas price is creeping up to 530. A gallon nationally will tell you why next. These will supplies are reaching critical levels in the United States, in particular, right here in the Northeast, the energy information.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,89,2022-10-28 20:14:48
4389," DeSoul supplies are reaching critical levels in the United States, in particular right here in the Northeast, the Energy Information Administration reporting. Just last week, the country had only 25 days of reserves remaining. Now the Biden administration weighing options to avert a crisis as we head towards the winter. For more, we're joined by Opus Global Head of Energy Analysis, Tom Closett. Good to see you by one metric. DeSoul levels lowest in 40 years, how concerned should we be? Well, I think we're concerned. I'd be a lot more concerned if this were the end of November or the end of December, because diesel fuel and heating oil are the same molecules, essentially. And it's used a lot in the Northeast and it's used in Europe. So we've seen prices in the Northeast go up by about $1.28 a gallon this month alone. And that's for diesel and for heating oil. The rest of the country may be 50 cents. And I would say that in a couple of weeks when you get PPI numbers, that's going to halt the inflationary aspects of those numbers. Tom, how long do you see supplies remaining tight then throughout the winter at least? I think so. If we get a mild winter, it really alters to calculus. And we do have some time now. It's probably worthwhile that we see these, you know, the use of the word shortage as opposed to tightness or whatever, because something does need to happen. The problem is December 5th is when the European Union essentially begins boycotting or banning Russian oil and Russian crude oil and Russian diesel are pretty much necessary for Europe and most of the North Atlantic. So it's going to be very, very touch and go. I would submit the baby in the next 40 days. We don't see much short selling in the market and like all markets that need short selling. So we're going to be very, very high up there. And again, I think it's bad for inflation. Things can move across the country by either vessels which use diesel now in their mix, trains and of course trucks. And it's very expensive with $550 to $6 prices out there. Tom speaking of Europe, we all talked for weeks. If not months about a coming energy crisis in Europe. And now European natural gas prices plummeting, they don't even know what to do with it because supplies are full. Is it too early to say coast is clear? Yeah, I think it's way too early. Now it does tell you what happens with these markets that make power ball like moves. I mean, natural gas went from the equivalent of like $100 of barrel to $500 of barrel at the end of August. And now it's back to about a third of that. So the same thing could happen in the United States. We're going to see the refineries get back in gear in the next month. They've had a lot of maintenance in October. They're going to make more gasoline, but they're really going to try to make more diesel, jeff fuel and heating oil because they're making $60, $70, $80, $90, $100 of barrel. They're making their fourth quarter margins right now in the first month of that quarter. So Tom, when you take a look at Europe, it sounds like it's more of a sigh of relief rather than the fact that maybe your policy makers should be complacent. I guess what should they be doing or could they be doing to make sure the situation doesn't get significantly worse throughout the winter? I think they're doing everything they can do right now. I mean, an embargo or a boycott is going to be very, very uncertain. And we don't really know what's going to happen. I mean, we have a desperate despot in charge of Russia. And he could cut off some of the supplies that would ordinarily go to Europe or some other countries. So there's a lot of uncertainty. And I don't think you'll see much selling in the market between now and December 5th. All right. I'd be remiss, Tom, if I didn't ask you about the Twitter back and forth between Exxon and President Biden, Exxon CEO suggesting on Twitter that's exactly what they're doing in the form of returning profits to the American people in the form of their quarterly dividend. And the answer from President Biden was, can't believe I have to say this, giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for American families. What's your take on this back and forth? You know, my take on this is like, well, at my country club, we don't have any non-unemployment. It's really tone deaf on the part of the Exxon CEO. I'm sorry. But giving money back to shareholders is not the equivalent of treating the people on the vote.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,90,2022-10-28 20:19:06
4390," It's really tone deaf on the part of the Exxon CEO. I'm sorry, but giving money back to shareholders is not the equivalent of treating the people on the margins of society who are paying these prices for heating oil, diesel, caracene, or whatever. He needs to speak to the people on main street and not on Wall Street. And Tom, to that point, take a look at main street. We know Exxon just posted another record profitable. When you take a look at gas prices, they have come down quite a bit. Here we are today at 3.76. When you take a look out over the next couple of months to your end, are you confident we'll remain below four bucks a gallon? Yeah, I think we're going to be OK on gasoline prices. Because companies like Exxon and all the refiners right now, they're going to be making so much money on the middle of the barrel, the diesel and the jet fuel, that they're going to make a lot of gasoline probably more than they would intend to make. So I think we're OK. And in the months of December and January and even February, we use about 15 to 20% less gasoline than we use in the driving season. So the whole thing again is, in the next 90 days, we'll look not so much for a point of stasis, but the launch pad from which the prices go at the end of the first quarter, 2020, 30, or in the spring. All right, Tom Closif from Opus. Appreciate it. Enjoy the weekend, sir. Thanks. All right, coming up, New UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has more ties to the United States than you might expect. We'll tell you about that next. A Botox boom during the pandemic is all but faded with the filler that is inflation. Ajali Kamalani here with that story. Aj, what do we learn? That's right. Good one there, Dave. Thank you. Thank you. That is right. We've got Avi reporting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,91,2022-10-28 20:23:27
4391," And Audrey Kimlani here with that story. And what do we learn? That's right. Good one there, Dave. Thank you. Thank you. That is right. We've got Abby reporting today that there is in fact a slow down in customer use of fillers and Botox, specifically lowering guidance for the year down 600 million to 5.3 billion, still not a bad number instead. And they do expect this to be a shorter term impact. They expect that customer confidence will increase in a short period of time, just like it did after the 2008-2009 recession. Also, the company is facing a patent cliff for its blockbuster drug, Humira. So that is another thing that they have on the books for next year, the impact there. And that of course, we know it was the whole reason why they merged with Allergan back in 2020. So everything combined kind of an uncertain day in terms of the quarter for them. But looking a little bit more positive out in the future. All right, Angelic and Lonnie, thanks so much for the appreciation of my jokes. No one laughs at my stuff on, so thanks. Have a good weekend. Appreciate it, Johnna. I always do, Dave. You know that. You do. You do. That's true. All right, let's turn to another story that we are watching. Your economic turmoil, a new king and two prime ministers in as many months. The United Kingdom has its challenges in the months to come. So it's Rishi Sunok up to the task to discuss where to go by Yahoo Finance, Editor-in-Chief, Andy Sirward. And I know you wrote about the special relationship between the UK and the US, especially when it comes to the new Prime Minister of the UK. Rishi Sunok, what can you tell us about that? Well, first of all, the special relationship between the UK and the United States. I mean, some people say, oh, we have a special relationship with France or Israel, but doesn't compare with England. It goes back six centuries. And actually, Sean, of the special relationship that phrase comes from Winston Churchill in 1946 in his speech with Harry Truman. So it goes back a long, long way. Of course, we have all the ties with movies and TV and rock music. Economically, a million people in the US work for British firms, a million people in the UK work for American firms, about a trillion dollars for our direct investment back and forth. So there's a lot there. And then, of course, politically, geopolitically right now with Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia less friendly than ever, having a real friend like the UK is more important than ever. So the special relationship still intact. I thought it came from love, actually, Andy. That is news to me. No, I know. It is a classic usage of these special relationships. Notting Hill. But, you know, as much as we talked and learned and heard about Boris Johnson, we've heard very little about new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. What are we learning? What about his connections to America? Yeah, I mean, his connections to America, Dave. It's really amazing. I mean, there's never been anything like this with the head of state in England or maybe any other country. The guy worked at Goldman Sachs. He went to Stanford. He worked at a hedge fund that invested in CSX, the railroad. He owns a house and apartment in Santa Monica. He even had a green card at one point. And then, you know, he's married to a woman whose there's Rishi right there. He's always kind of a good dresser. Dapper guy. His wife is the daughter, his wife who went to Claremont McKenna who he met at Stanford, is the daughter of the founder of Infosys, the giant Indian outsourcing company. So that family's fortune, a lot of it was outsourcing jobs from the United States. And, you know, if you think about it though, Rishi Sunak sort of represents the relationship between the United States and England in a way that's sort of very 21st century. It's about finance. You know, if you think about the 20th century, Winston Churchill and military, maybe going back to the 19th century, Andrew Carnegie with the commercial relationship. So very much a man of the time representing this relationship between England and the United States, I mean, as I said, he had a green card at one point. Yeah, wow, it really, really highlights the strong connection there. Andy, we certainly know that this is a very challenging job, particularly at this time. We talked about the pound falling to a record low against the dollar. Obviously, economic crisis, I think you can call it of what you can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,92,2022-10-28 20:27:37
4392," challenging job, particularly at this time. We talked about the pound falling to a record low against the dollar. Obviously, the economic crisis at the U.N. call it of what the U.K. is in right now. Do you think Rishi is the right person for the job? Well, he certainly has this financial background. The first hedge fund manager to be the Prime Minister of England, worked at a hedge fund to be absolutely precise there. We spoke to Ann Berry, who runs Threadneedle, and she actually worked at Goldman Sachs with Rishi, sat next to him when they were both analysts years ago and points out that this is a guy who spent his entire career thinking about markets, thinking about supply chain on the global inter-connectivity of markets. That's crucially important for the U.K. right now, particularly as they're alone, not with the EU, need to rely on the United States a lot. So, from a capital markets perspective, he has the expertise. And of course, the markets have stabilized in the U.K. since he became Prime Minister. Now, as far as foreign policy goes, that's another matter and very, very complicated right now. So, we'll have to see about that. But he is in the crosshairs and has a big job in front of him. He certainly does. You can read Andy's column on Yahoo Finance dot com over the weekend. Andy, thanks so much for stopping by in studio. Have a good week. All right. We'll come in. Next, Dave's conversation with Major League Baseball's Chief Revenue Officer and everything from streaming to sports betting as a world series kicks off tonight. Don't go on. Major League Baseball season that started one week late under the storm clouds of a lockout is now near its pinnacle. Just a few hours away from game one of the world series. Got the 87 win surprise Philadelphia Phillies at the 106 win Houston Astros.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,93,2022-10-28 20:32:10
4393," few hours away from game one of the World Series. Got the 87 wins, surprise Philadelphia Phillies at the 106 win Houston Astros in the fall classic for the fourth time in six years. So you've got expanded playoffs, new sponsorships, streaming and sports gambling. How have they impacted the business of baseball? I touched all those bases with MLB chief revenue officer Noah Garden earlier today. The great news for us is we were able to come to a great agreement with the players and the players association. We played a full season, which is culminating now in a really exciting way. You take a look at the expanded postseason. I'll tell you that from our perspective, overwhelming us, the goal of that was to keep more fan bases active for a longer period of time. September, we saw some of the best attendance numbers in September that we've seen in almost as long as I've been here. And that's attributable to all these fan bases that are having more of an opportunity to compete for some of these coveted spots in the postseason. And listen, you're seeing it tonight. You've got a team that, if not for that expanded postseason, they may not be there today. And they're there, they're playing well. They're exciting. That fan base is rabid. And we got an amazing matchup that we're going to see the next week we can have. Nobody had Philly headed this far. The thought prevailing wisdom out there as you needed New York or LA for a massive television audience. What do you make of that? Listen, everybody always points to those sorts of things. I mean, you see the numbers, right? You see the numbers throughout our certainly our expanded wild card. You see the numbers, the division series and on our ratings are up. And if you've watched, as I know you have some of these games, I mean, those fan bases, first of all, in Houston, they're always there. They've been supporting that team forever. They're rabid. It's exciting. Every time I'm there, my new watch tells me the sound is going to make me deaf. The decibels are too loud. And listen, it's shining through in Philadelphia too. I've got to be in both places and the excitement. I mean, it's taken over the entire town. And so we're excited by the matchup. It's two amazing markets. And I think it's going to be great series. Let's talk about some of the television deals. Now, you've been in streaming before anyone. MLB.tv was 20 years, really, ahead of the game. But new partnerships with, of course, Apple TV and with Peacock, how successful were they? And do you imagine more streaming in the future? Yeah, it's interesting. I started in baseball on the MLB.com side. So I was there in 2002 when we were streaming when Netflix was still still sending DVDs, door to door. So we were early for sure. And I don't think anybody really understood back then what it was going to be today. And I'm sure 20 years of it'll look as different than as it does, not us looking back. I'll tell you that, listen, it's been increasingly hard to reach our fans, right? Our fans, even within the linear bundle distribution has been a challenge. And fans, whether they're young or old now, want to watch content and where they are in summer streaming and some are leaning back on their couch and watching the TV in front of them. And we used to say back then at MLB.com, if it has a plug or battery, we should be on it. And we live by that today. And so we'll continue to go where our fans are and hopefully deliver a world class product that we can be proud of and they can enjoy. And knock on what these deals with Apple and Peacock this year were not to both. Both a little different quite frankly. Peacock was interesting in the sense that they wanted this earlier time frame that was really earlier than we'd started games in the past other than maybe one game in Boston during the marathon. And we weren't sure what we'd to expect from that, but overwhelming success. The time slot was great. Players like playing earlier, they've done an absolutely fantastic job. Apple, just take a step back. We've been partners with Apple forever. We were the first to stream on their iPhone, first to stream on their iPad. We were on stage with them almost every single release. This is an extension of a longstanding close relationship that we've had with them. We've had the number one sports app on there. So just made a tremendous amount of sense for us. And we reached just a lot of fans. And listen, we're seeing a lot of the, they're seeing a lot of the same halo effect that sports has traditionally brought to other content too what they're saying is it's bringing people in there because of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,94,2022-10-28 20:36:20
4394," And, you know, listen, we're seeing a lot of the, they're seeing a lot of the same halo effect that sports has traditionally brought to other content too, what they're saying is it's bringing people in there because it's the system that they've not seen before. And it's certainly from the numbers perspective, you know, we're seeing more eyeballs than I thought we'd see. So great test, more to come. But it doesn't mean that the success on streaming is going to, you know, get it, take us away from linear or otherwise, right? From a numbers perspective, how important was it to stay away from the NFL on the World Series schedule? You know what, listen, I'm not really important. Look at what we did in, in wildcard this year, right? We were on wildcard on a weekend when there was a lot of sports, so great, there was some great college football games, it was NFL. Look at the ratings that we had and that that continued into the DS. So when we do our schedule, it's really not about, you know, put it based on other content that's out there. It's really on when we think most of our fans are going to be able to watch the games and and and and share on their favorite team. And I think that's the way you seen it play it out. Like every professional sport, the tie-in with sports gambling is essential in terms of growth and in terms of reaching a younger demographic. Can you talk about how that has helped baseball grow and get younger? Yeah, listen, it's, it's, I think we're sort of in the early stages. I'm not sure it's we're fully materialized on that effort yet, but I would say that that's the goal, right? The goal was never about like how much money are you going to make from sports gambling? It was about, it was really about engagement, right? If people are engaged for longer periods of time, they're going to watch the game for longer period of time. That's going to adhere to the benefit of, you know, television ratings, it's going to advertise and all the the things that we look at when we're trying to create a successful business. I would still say we have more to come. It's been great, right? They're it's bringing it's doing exactly what we thought. But at the same time, we still need to innovate in the way people gamble. We still need to provide more content to that, you know, that section of our fans and more data. And that's where you're going to start to see, you know, alternative broadcasts, you know, we're we we have a family product, we're committed on our, you know, our main feed, so to say, to have to continue to not overgamblify it, right? To not make sure we're creating all that content for such a distinct audience. That's the beauty of streaming too, right? You can have all these different feeds and address different types of fans. And so you're going to see us get more aggressive in that space, providing, you know, different types of broadcast to to those fans. And most importantly, you're going to find you're going to innovate on the way you can, you know, bet on different things within the game. Let's touch on attendance quickly. Down a bit still from 2019 pre pandemic up from last year. How do you view it? Are there things you can do to evolve the game that would juice attendance to you? If you watch things like this Savannah bananas and how they're changing the product a little bit. Listen, I love this available bananas, right? It's sort of like our it's just fun to watch. I'll tell you attendance is funny. I'm very encouraged by attendance this year. I mean, if you think about it, we went into this year, as we discussed earlier, sort of in the, you know, tail end of the pandemic, if it was a tail end who knows, but people were still afraid to get out and you saw that in the numbers early on. From that time to where we are today, we saw some of our best numbers in the September timeframe. We continued to make up the ground that we lost early throughout the entire season. And, you know, from a trajectory standpoint, I couldn't be really more pleased where we are. So I think, you know, we ended on a strong note. We had a great postseason looking forward to next year. And, you know, I think headed in the right direction for sure. Sean, I just have to take issue with one thing Noah said there. I really think it was intentional that they stayed away from the NFL Sundays. It's the first time since 1947 that there was no planned Sunday world series games. And the head of Fox sports programming says, obviously, we didn't want to go head to head with the NFL on multiple nights. But we won't, we won't stick on that too much. I know you have a horse in this race. Who you got? I do. Obviously, the Phillies, my hometown, there's so much excitement going on in the city right now around Bryce Harper and also with Kyle Schwarber. Schwarber fast going on at Wawa. The city is so excited. We just heard just about the excitement surrounding the game.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,95,2022-10-28 20:40:40
4395," Bryce Harper and also with Kyle Schwarber. Schwarber fast going on. At Wawa, the city is so excited. We just heard just about the excitement surrounding the game ahead of this series. Dave, I hope you're with me in rooting for the Phillies. Can you do it? 100%. I want Bryce Harper to win a world series. I think he's great for the game. Love the Swagger. I know. I know. It is about time that Bryce Harper did win. All right. Well, let's turn to another story that we are closely watching here. Crypto investors were hit hard by taxes this year, despite those losses across the board that we have seen over the last several months. Many investors won't be getting much relief from the IRS in April. So here to weigh in, a jacket with finance, personal finance reporter Rebecca Chen and Rebecca, I think many crypto investors were hoping to recoup some of those losses. We're hoping for a break this year when it comes to taxes, but it doesn't sound like that's going to be the case. So that's correct. So, Sean, in 2021, crypto went up in value in many hit record high. However, in 2022, investors just weren't so lucky. Unfortunately, a lot of the valuations has dropped. And even though many have hoped this year that they could take that loss on their return, IRS has come out and say that crypto's are property investment, and which means that it is subject to certain loss roles. So I think what investors should be aware of this coming tax season are couple items. The first is that regardless of how much loss they have incurred throughout the year, in order to take these losses on their returns, they have to sell their crypto. So without selling the crypto for the IRS, it just really doesn't, they cannot take that on their return because it hasn't really, nothing has happened in terms of what IRS thinks. And the second is that I'm sure a lot of investors had a great year last year and paid a lot of taxes. And so they're probably hoping that with this year's loss, they could carry that loss back and then deduct their gain from last year and hopefully get some money back. But unfortunately, IRS doesn't allow this type of carry back for individuals. So that's another thing. And the last thing is, there's this thing called the capital loss limitation. So regardless of how much loss you've incurred this year, the most you can take on your tax return is $3,000. So even if you had $10,000 of loss or $100,000 of loss, the most you can take is $3,000. The good news is that even with this $3,000 loss limitation rule, what you can do is for all the extra losses that you have, you can carry a four forever into your future returns until you use them up. So there are some limitations there, but also some, I guess, areas of opportunity. What about those investors who unfortunately were affected by if they had an investment and say, Luna, what is your advantage? What is your advantage to that? So for Luna, there's many cryptos that has lost a lot of value this year and to certain investors, certain cryptos became potentially worthless. So for these, although the IRS doesn't really come out and say they can't deduct the loss on these worthless cryptos, the experts that I have been chatting with said that try to sell these for a penny or even a fraction of a penny on any exchange. And once you've done that, you can come to the IRS and say, hey, I sold these. I had these transactions and now I want my loss. Yes, certainly some good advice. Seren's speaking of advice. Taxi's in its only five months away. It's going to be here before we know it. You know, we always talk about that. We always try to prepare our taxes ahead of time. What's some of your advice for crypto investors out there as we do approach April of next year? So a lot of the CPS I've talked with, they said that one of the biggest struggles that he sees his clients face is the fact of providing good record. As we know, cryptocurrencies, the trading goes pretty fast. You can buy and sell, buy and sell multiple times a day or even within a second. So sometimes it's hard to track exactly what you sell or what you purchase a certain currency for. So doing that, keeping a really good record is definitely extremely important. And also if you sell a currency and you cannot prove your basis to the IRS, they could come out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,96,2022-10-28 20:45:02
4396," Definitely extremely important. And also if you sell a currency and you cannot prove your basis to the IRS, they could come to you and say, since you can't prove it, we're going to say you bought this for free or you bought it for a penny and we're going to tax you on your entire amount of proceeds. And nobody wants to pay more tax than they need to. So it is definitely very important to keep a great record for the tax season. It's a very, very important advice there. Rebecca Chan, thanks so much for joining us in studio and welcome to the live shows. It's great to have you. We look forward to having you back. Thank you so much. All right, coming up next, shares of Meta plundering this week following just appointing earnings results with the social media giant. It wasn't the only big mover on Wall Street. We've got the rest for you next. There's been quite a wild week on Wall Street. We're taking a look at some of the biggest movers of the week tech has dominated the headlines or the past five trading days. So let's start with Meta shares had taken a huge hit after the company missed on earnings issued weaker than expected guidance. Meta's reality labs, which includes its VR headsets losing $9 billion in the first three quarters of the year. We took a look at the shares. They have plundered just about 23% over the past five days. A lot of those losses coming within just the last two days. The shares fell to the lowest level that we've seen since 2016. And that also means big losses for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He lost about $11 billion in net worth over the past two days. We take a look at that 20% drop in Meta over the past 13 months. His net worth has dropped by just around $100 billion. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGCNefZYa3Y,97,2022-10-28 20:49:28
4397," Two days when we take a look at that 20-plus percent drop in meta over the past 13 months his net worth has dropped by just around $100 billion. All right, next up let's take a look at Alphabet Google. The parent company there shares off just around almost 5 percent over the past five trading days. But the big emphasis on this was earlier this week when the company missed on revenue earnings fell short of expectations. Also, in ad sales growth was a big issue as firms really cut their budgets. The tech giants drop on earnings was the biggest intraday decline that we have seen since March 2020. You're looking at that drop on Wednesday. A drop of just around 7 percent ending the week just above 96 bucks a share. Not despite the week results. Some analysts did say bullish on the name Evercord Deutsche Bank Oppenheimer and Morgan Stanley all maintaining their overweight ratings. When you take a look at this stock year today still severely in the red that large decline off just around 33 percent. All right, let's round. There take a look at Twitter here because the New York Stock Exchange de-listing shares after Elon Musk closed his $44 billion deal to buy the company's first move at the Helmi-Austed Twitter's top three executives announced a closure of the deal here ending that long drawn out saga. Now Twitter shares rallying 26 percent over the past month and over the past two months ago. This shares have just around 32 percent at the end of the training day yesterday Twitter closed at 53.70. So just below the 54 20 per share price that Musk agreed to pay back in April and wasn't all about tech this week. We also want to take a look at caterpillar that company out with earnings here this week. A strong result really pushing shares up more than 10 percent at the highs of yesterday and take a look at the one week chart over the past five days. Caterpillar closing the week up just around 15 percent. Thursday's jump was the largest post earnings jump that we had seen in the company in just about five years. Caterpillar is just one of the industrial names benefiting from some economic optimism. But despite all this, it wasn't good enough for all the analysts out there. Deutsche Bank actually downgraded Caterpillar to hold writing in a note to clients. Like, well, we have to draw a line in the sand on intrinsic value and taking a look at this stock over the past three months. Our Laguna shares up just around 16 percent since the start of the year. Though caterpillar, one of the fewer names holding onto gains a year today up just around a six percent. Man, Sean, it feels like a month in the past. It's a foreign market skill. And it's another big one on tap next week. Here's what we're watching. It is, of course, a Fed week Monday, trick-or-treating, but we're also watching for some data. We'll get PMI. We'll get earnings from XPO logistics, Avis, Affleck, and IMAX. On Tuesday, we'll get a glance at manufacturing numbers, Jolts, as well as vehicle sales, and a busy earnings day with Uber, Eli Lilly, AMD, Airbnb, just to name a few. Our day is Fed day. We'll get another 75-point hike we think from Jerome Powell to a clock press conference. Also earnings from CVS, Young Brands, the parent company of KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, Etsy, MGM, eBay, Robinhood, all report. Thursday earnings from Peloton, Cars.com, Penn Entertainment, Queen Desk, Starbucks, Door Dash, and Yelp, among others, and finally Friday. It is a jobs day. Earnings also from Draft Kings and from Hershey, who by the way, stock up 24% year-to-date ahead of Halloween.

I'd start off where you talked about $10.6 billion of that 10.6, $3.2 billion will be confectionery. So we at Mars Regley, the authority on Halloween, we're very excited for Halloween 2022. And there's a couple of reasons behind that. One, we had record sell through in 2021. And the excitement from our retail partners across the US, we collaborate with them over a year in advance. And they were very, very excited about the results of 21. And we worked with them every step of the way. We know from the National Retail Federation that 75% of the US households will be participating in Halloween this year. That's up 11% from last year, which is great news. And within that 75%, 93% will celebrate with confectionery. So yeah, we're super excited about Halloween 2022. Bet you are. I love that wall of M&Ms there behind you. Candy Inflation is one of the big stories this season. How is inflation impacting the bottom line for you? And is Candy Flat Out Recession proof? Yeah, so when I tell you at Mars Regley, the consumer is our boss. And value for money is a critical element in everything we do. So we look to take costs out of the system everywhere we go.

We're not recession proof by any stretch, we've been impacted by inflation, but we make sure our portfolio fits every consumer need state. So we have price points from $3, $5, $10, which is a critical price point, all the way up to $30. So Halloween can still be an affordable treat to celebrate my personal favorite season.

4402," The discussing markets are gearing up for the Fed's next policy move. Officials expected to deliver a fourth straight 75 basis point hike at the end of the Central Bank's two-day meeting on Wednesday. Investors are looking for any sign that the Fed could then pause its hikes in the future, but could aggressive moves to tighten pull the U.S. into a deeper recession than is expected. FL Plutton's chief market strategist, Ellen Hayes, and joins us now to weigh in. And Ellen, there seems to be this conundrum right now, right? We keep talking about some of the underlying strength in the economy. That's expected to be an evidence again with the DRAWS report on Friday, but that in turn might mean that the Fed has to keep on going longer than it otherwise would. So does that mean indeed we're going to be forced into a deeper recession? Well, we'll just have to see what the Fed says, not only in the commentary and the press release, but in the written commentary as well on Wednesday. I will say this though, what we have seen in October, earning season so far is that companies are actually showing negative operating leverage. So you mentioned that the unemployment rate has remained low and the job market has remained strong. That's absolutely right. And the way that that reconciles with the Fed actually slowing the economy is that margins are going down. So we see negative operating leverage. We see companies not cutting workers and therefore the Fed may continue to raise rates in the idea with the idea that unemployment might have to go up, but they're not going to see unemployment go up because companies are choosing to hold on to their workers instead. Right now the markets are anticipating that peak Fed is going to be in March or April. We'll see if that happens, but we think if it goes beyond March or April, they really will do damage to the economy. Looking a little more short term specifically this week, we have the Fed meeting as you've been discussing also the jobs report. What do you think could spook investors after this October rally? Well, certainly if the Fed talks about another 75 in December and or throws cold water on this market implied 5% peak and early next year peak. So that would be one thing that would cause a problem. Similarly, if the job number comes in really strong, I know we're looking for 190, but if it comes in in 250, 300 range, that also is going to throw cold water on it because it's going to lead the markets to conclude that the Fed has to be much more aggressive. And so if the Fed is to be much more aggressive than are there certain parts of the market that you anticipate will be the most reactive on a continued basis given what we've already seen thus far in the Fed's policy pathway? I think that the trends we've seen over the last couple of years are going to continue. In other words, those companies whose cash flows are very far out into the future are going to continue to have tough, multiple compression. We all remember from our finance 101 that higher interest rates means the same cash flows are worth less than they were under lower interest rates. And so if we see continued fed hiking, if we see the yield curve going up, then we are going to see continued multiple compression for those far out growth companies. But what's interesting is that in the operating margin contraction front, you're seeing it across the board. It's not just in technology and financials where you would expect to see it, but you're also seeing the operating margin contraction in healthcare, in utilities. So it's not only the multiple that's going to come down, but it's the actual earnings that are going to come down. And that's happening across the board. And Ellen, you say in your notes, us people have to eat their vegetables right now in that at this time. What do you mean by that? People's vegetables. And then what are some of the criteria you're using? And then what are some of the picks you found using those criteria? So when we say that investors need to eat their vegetables, what it means is that you need to do the things that you know are good for you, but maybe you don't quite enjoy as much. And what I'm talking about there is individual stock research and looking at the competitive positioning, the growth opportunity, the margin profile of companies, one by one by one, rather than picking meme stocks or even picking big tech, both of which had been big winners in recent years without a whole lot of homework. And so by vegetables, I mean doing the homework, doing those things that are good for you by looking at the cash flows, by looking at the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,1,2022-10-31 13:50:34
4403," in recent years without a whole lot of homework. And so by vegetables, I mean doing the homework, doing those things that are good for you by looking at the cash flows, by looking at the details, by looking at the dividends, and finding companies that are going to score well on those. And we're finding opportunities in healthcare. Some of the big farm names are trading at low double digit multiples and they still have 2.5% yield in the defense space. The name we're looking at is L3 Harris, which has a strong yield is going to grow in the midteens. So if you look, you can find them. But it does require going one by one and finding companies that have the growth and have the cash flows. You're also looking at US apartment rates. Within that landscape, it's directly related to, I believe, as you put in your notes, benefits from housing shortages. And given the kind of conundrum that the housing market finds itself in, the number of people that are priced out of buying a home, flooding into the rental market, which also pushes higher, the prices of renting. How long do you see that being a contracted issue for? That's a really interesting question, because there are opposing forces at work. So on the one hand, you have a structural shortage of new homes. And that has been true for some years, and particularly starter homes. And what that means is that more and more people have to rent. On the other hand, rents are going up, and we know that's contributing to the CPI increase. And at some point, there may be a political rebellion against higher rents, because that's been so visible in the inflation numbers. But in terms of this underlying structural fundamentals, they're still a housing shortage, and that's going to mean higher rents as more people move to the rental market. Interesting. All right. Thank you so much. Ellen, appreciate it. Ellen Hayes and F.L. Putnam's chief markets strategist appreciate it. Coming up, what's the biggest catalyst for the alcohol industry?

That's lower on the day by about 1%. And you're taking a look at the past three months, but let's also just take a look as we round out this month as the month to date comes to a conclusion here over the month of October. You're seeing that the Nasdaq composites is held on to gains of about 3.8% in what's been a good month and aggregate here. And so ultimately here we'll see how things end out on the month. And then the S&P 500, uh, you're seeing that also, uh, net positive over the past 21 days that this point in. I don't know why we're not getting the full scope. But anyway, we are down on the day by about eight tens of percent here, briefly taking a look at some of the sector activity as well. You've got more laggards. Um, actually all of the S&P 500 sectors were in negative territory earlier. We do have two that have trickled into positive territory. And surprise, surprise energy is one of them. It's up by about nine cents of a percent. Flat just barely to the upside right now. You've got materials that's up flat, but to the upside by about one tenth of a percent. With that, it's all things on over to you. Interesting. The energy is continuing that huge run. It's had this year and for the month of October. Let's zoom out now for a global look at the economy. Investors have turned cautious after the disappointing release of China's manufacturing and non-many manufacturing by both unexpectedly contracted in October, pointing to more economic headwinds ahead. This is China continues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,4,2022-10-31 14:03:52
4406," manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI, both unexpectedly contracted in October, pointing to more economic headwinds ahead. This, as China continues to grapple with COVID-19 lockdowns. We mentioned earlier today that Disney Shanghai also shut its doors to comply with COVID-19 prevention measures. Our next guest, Warns of China's economy, will not profess enough to compensate for the boost in export demand it saw from state home orders during COVID. Joining us now with our insight is Waley BlackRock Global Chief Investment Stragist. Thank you so much for being here. Appreciate it. As we look at the China situation, we are still seeing lockdowns there, renewed wave of lockdowns seemingly. At the same time, the economy is struggling to break out. So, first of all, I guess, when do you see the lockdowns may be starting to end? And secondly, even when they do, what happens with the economy there? I think it's really important to recognize that there are some structural headwinds to growth right now in the case of China. So, yes, of course, the Zero COVID policy has way down on growth expectations so far this year. But it's not just Zero COVID policies. Also, export drivers that have been such a big contributor to China growth during the COVID pandemic period that is now fading away as the rest of the world switches back on. So, as the export drivers kind of fades, actually, that represents a structural kind of headwinds to China growth, which is why we're forecasting just slightly above 3% for this year. And higher than that, of course, next year as China reopens, but not very high. So, we're not going to see a reshaped rebound in the case of China. Should investors just avoid investing in China at all right now? I think the tactical and the strategic case for investing in China right now is challenged because of this also focus from not just growth to broader issues like national security, all of that representing a bit of a headwind for structural growth, but also in terms of how that headline growth can translate into corporate profitability, which is why earlier on in the year, we downgraded China from overweight to neutral. And actually, currently, strategically, there is a underweight allocation to China government bonds because the youth pick up attractiveness versus US government bonds has been eroded away as we now get paid by holding US government bonds. Are we just not going to see any of the kind of tit for tat tariffs that we had seen during the US China trade war over the past couple of years and even going into 2020 waiting for some type of resolution on where that would move forward? Are we just not going to have those conversations reemerge and actually for it to get worse before there's any inkling that may get better? I think it's very optimistic to hope for a resolution around the trade war and tit for tech between US and China. In fact, if anything, we have seen acceleration of some of that geopolitical tension. So thinking about the focus on cheap manufacturing, thinking about that the broader kind of decoupling and moving further apart of the spheres of influence between US and China. So I think that is going to be the base case underpinning our structural kind of expectation on the geopolitical front and for investors thinking about investing in China from a global portfolio perspective. We need to think about what that means from a risk premium perspective when we construct portfolios. Let's talk about portfolio construction with regard to the US as well. As you mentioned a moment ago, we're now finally getting paid to hold US funds, which is an experience we haven't had in a while. In fact, the US Treasury website has been crashing on a kitchen as retail investors try to get on there. At the same time, obviously there is a puzzle here for the Federal Reserve as it is raising rates. What is your rate outlook here in the US? What are you expecting here from the Fed on Wednesday? Well, I think the 75 bits of rate hikes is a foregone conclusion that will happen. But what really matters is how far rate hikes can go and also for how long that will stay and also what that means for growth. So earlier on in the segment you talked about the October rally. We believe that the October rally in risk assets is really on shaky grounds because markets previously were looking for a dovish pivot from the Fed and then the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,5,2022-10-31 14:07:56
4407," We leave the October rally in risk assets is really unshaking grounds because markets previously were looking for a dovish pivot from the Fed. And then they were looking for a pause from the Fed. And now markets are getting excited about just the pace of rate hike decreasing, which of course it will, because you cannot keep hiking as the S-75 bibs permitting. So if you select markets, wants to see some positive development in terms of dovish message from the Fed. But really we're not at that juncture yet because if you look at core inflation, it's still very, very sticky from last week's core PCE, for example, still really quite persistent. And at the same time, the focus of the Fed is really solely on the politics of inflation, with inflation where things are. The mandate is to fight inflation at all costs this year. So we believe that rates will continue rising. It will peak at 5% and not to understate it. That's a very, very restrictive territory. In fact, where we are now at 3.25% is already restrictive to the economy. So our belief is that in this current supply constraint environment, the Fed is going to have to engineer a recession in order to bring down inflation. Our assessment is that if they were to want to bring down inflation to 2%, reasonably quickly, it represents a 2% shock to the US economy in 2023. It also represents a 3 million additional people out of a drop, pushing unemployment rates to 5%. So this is the sort of the very heavy and high cost of inflation fighting in the current environment shaped by supply. And that's what we're looking for from the Fed. The acknowledgement of the tougher tradeoff from this environment. The markets on shaky ground, like you mentioned, just given the potential for more negative news into your end. You think the gains we've seen in October get unwound? It's possible. It's possible. Because a lot of the bad news really kind of starting to come together and they have yet to be reflected in market pricing. So I talked about the Fed and the economy, but we haven't talked about earnings season because the shocking kind of downside surprise of the big tech names last week. And yet earnings forecasts are coming down, but not down enough. Next year, as in P500, we're still talking about meat to high single-digit growth for US earnings in 2023. That is really not aligned with our expectation for recession next year. So earnings needs to come down. It's not yet in the price. And I think markets will wake up to that before finding a foundation to the radio. For investors that are still willing to have some type of risk component in their portfolio, they might look at speculative assets that are highly kind of deteriorated from some of their peak values. And I think about crypto. BlockRock has its own kind of blockchain-based ETF as well. I believe you've launched two of them over the course of this year, but I guess more broadly speaking, is this still a time to be kind of looking at crypto, even though the valuations are highly depressed from where we began even at the kind of early points of the year here? Well, with regards to crypto, there is a demand. That's why we issue the products to address that demand. But assumptions on return and risk needs to be really positive for crypto to justify even a small, very, very small allocation in a hope of all your contacts. So to your point about where to deploy risk currently, we are underweight development market equities, but we're just more densely underweight. We are overweight investment-grade credit. In this environment, we believe that investment-grade credit offers you income. And also pricing in a version goes the growth slowdown that we're forecasting. So this is where we want to deploy risk budget at this point. Really great conversation. Waley, BlackRock global chief investment strategist, thanks for coming to studio. We appreciate it.

Julie, thank you so much Unilever is looking to counteract foreign costs with price hikes saying it raised its prices by a record 12 and a half percent in third quarter Move caused the consumer goods company lift its full-your-sales growth guidance to over 8 percent in 2022 Unilever CEO Alan Jope joins us now Alan good to have you on the program here Talked a lot to a lot of different consumer products companies in recent weeks and trying to get a sense if the consumers trading down Given the inflation the Rc and what are you seeing in your business Bro Alan I think you're muted Apologies Brian. Thanks. We had another good quarter of growth. We've raised our guidance as you said Um, and it's coming in line with our strategic priorities in particular our big brands are doing very well Unilever has 12 billion euro brands and those brands grew 14% in the quarter To directly answer your question our portfolio is made up about 35% of our businesses in premium segments 50% in the middle of the market and 15% in what we would consider value offerings And slightly counterintuitively in times of inflation we are not seeing trading down The uh premium end of our portfolio is growing at least as fast as the value segment I think that may be a moment in time we've invested a lot in our brands in quality and in marketing support And I don't think we're anywhere near the end of the inflationary period so um we are Preparing for potential future downtrading, but we're not seeing it right now Brian For the customers as of right now are you looking at where prices are having to be passed through to them and Where they're continuing to take those prices versus where they're pushing back on those prices and which product categories are you seeing that most? So the first thing to say is that we're extremely sensitive to the situation that uh the ordinary household is finding itself in around the world And price increases are our last resort not our first resort where we are doing everything we can To take waste and cost out of our own business. We are very far from having passed along all of the inflationary costs that we have felt Uh to the consumer um one Uh particularly important thing to look at is There are most of the markets of the world outside the US are experiencing Simultaneously commodity inflation and currency devaluation and in those markets We are seeing um mid to high teens price increases places like Latin America uh southeastern Turkey Um in countries with harder currencies like the US of course it's just the commodity inflation Uh that is being passed through and even then not at uh 100% As far as cut our retail customers are concerned we're working in partnership with them so far It's been very collaborative And uh we all have the same thing which is to try and provide great value to the consumer remember Value is not just price it's a function of quality and price Alan it's Julie here. I have some Question about you know leave your structure if you will we know that Nelson Pelt is now in the board of the company Um, we know that you are leaving at the end of next year What does you even leave her look like five years from now three years from now as a result of the big change in leadership As well as perhaps changes that he's pushing for Yeah, um, I would like to just Confirm that Nelson is turning out to be a great member of the board Um, I'm thoroughly enjoying working with him and As far as he tells me he's enjoying working with me We recently made a radical before Nelson joined the board actually we made a significant strain",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,8,2022-10-31 14:20:50
4410," early enjoying working with them and as far as he tells me he's enjoying working with me. We recently made a radical, before Nelson joined the board actually, we made a significant change to our structure. We moved from a rather complex matrix organization that we've had for about a couple of decades actually and we moved to five divisions, each somewhere between eight and 12 billion euros of revenue. Interestingly, after all the work we've done in our portfolio shedding slower growth businesses like spreads or tea and acquiring into higher growth spaces like luxury beauty or health and well-being. Each one of those five business groups has the potential to grow ahead of Unilever's overall growth over the last five years. So we've done our tinkering with the organization. We've got five very focused business units and Nelson is very supportive of that direction on org change. And Alan, Unilever perhaps more than any other company of its size has pushed a lot into some of your units becoming B corporations. And I wonder if you've gotten any pushback either from PELTS or other investors if there's any plans to sort of pull back on those kinds of efforts. There's been sort of a larger public backlash against some of those types of efforts not specific to Unilever as well. What's your current thinking on it? You know, we are not an NGO. We're a for-profit organization and the reason why we care so much about sustainable business, B-corp's and other expressions of it is because we think it contributes to the bottom line. We're seeing our brands that offer consumers a sustainable choice are growing much faster. We've taken 1.2 billion euros of cost out of the business through sustainable sourcing. We know it reduces risk. A world on fire under watchers not a great place to be selling soap or soup. And it's a magnet for talent. Our employer brand is in tremendous shape because of our commitment sustainability. We hear overwhelmingly from shareholders and board members, all of our board members to stay the course. BlackRock work with us on our carbon commitments. Other investors work with us on our nutrition profiles. Other investors are interested in our commitment to pay a fair living wage and our value chain. These are all actions taken to make Unilever a strong business into the future and improve the bottom line. They're not in any way an alternative to strong financial performance. Alan, is Nelson running the playbook he did when he shook up P&G? By that I mean, is it more of an internal changes in how things operate or is a different situation at Unilever where you might see asset sales within the next six to 12 months? We've been busy on portfolio changes, I already mentioned. We've committed to the market that we are not undertaking a major portfolio change for the next, for the foreseeable future. Our board is unanimously aligned behind the strategy that we've laid out in our last couple of earnings quarters and we will lay out again in our capital markets day. Please don't be expecting any surprises from Unilever. We've got five wonderful divisions, a business that's capable of delivering high quality growth and that as you'll see from our performance and our share prices are rather resilient through the types of downturn that the world is going into right now. It sounds like Alan, you are enjoying working with Nelson. I do think you'll stay on longer than you expect. Look, I made a deal with myself and my family when I came into this job to do it for up to five years. I'm already four years in the end and next year is five years. We've accomplished a lot of the things that we wanted to accomplish. I am enjoying working with the board and with Nelson as a member of that board but we've made our decision on a leadership of this company and I'm sure the board will do a great job finding a wonderful successor. We often ask executives such as yourself whether you're activating an economic downturn playbook or a recessionary playbook but from what you're seeing in the data and the sales that comes through and across some of the core segments that you operate are your consumers operating their own recessionary playbook. That is a great question. You know, not one of us in this short",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,9,2022-10-31 14:25:09
4411," that you operate, are your consumers operating their own recessionary playbook? That is a great question. You know, not one of us in this show or in Unilever's business has lived through an operated business through a period of significant global inflation. But we have plenty of markets around the world that have operated through peers of inflation. So if you ask Unilever's managers in Argentina, or Brazil, or Turkey, or parts of Southeast Asia, we certainly have a playbook on what to do in inflationary times. And we are following. I think one unusual characteristic of this downturn is it's accompanied by high levels of employment. And things have to get pretty grim in a household before they start to materially cut back on the type of brands that we sell. So far so good. We are not complacent and we're certainly drawing on our playbook from those other markets around the world. Alan, finally, we wanted to ask you just quickly about the dry shampoo recall that the company just issued affecting a number of different brands for potential presence of benzene. It seems as though benzene has been creeping its way into various kinds of consumer products and causing these kinds of recalls. How does that kind of thing happen? And then what do you do to address it? Yeah, we have an enviable track record for the quality and safety of our brands. It is true that we discovered very, very extreme low levels of benzene in the propellant of a number of dry shampoo's. Our safety experts and independent experts have assessed that there is no safety risk to consumers. But out of an abundance of caution, we put safety ahead of any other value in the business. And so we are recalling a small number of of these products. And we have the highest protocols for safety. But every now and again, something creeps through the net. And we will be measured by our response. And at the moment, our response is the most cautious one we could possibly must start. Is there a financial write down that you expect as a result of the recalls? No, the financial impact is trivial. We appreciate the time, Alan. Thank you very much. The countdown to midterm elections is on. Kevin's really going to join us to break down what to expect next. The countdown to midterm elections is on. The countdown to midterm elections is on.

4412," pain relief Midterm elections are drawing near with only eight days to go and polls are projecting tight races in key states. Yahoo Finance contributor Kevin Sir really joins us now. Kevin great to speak on this with you. Look John Featherman might be losing a couple of wallaw supporters with that sheet. But we'll let that slide. We'll let that slide. Well did you see I think it was a set up majority leader Chuck Schumer's hot mic moment to President Biden the other day in which he said that that debate performance is not hurting him so much in the polls. This according to Schumer's hot mic analysis to President Biden who of course was campaigning in Pennsylvania and it's not just President Biden who's going to be hitting the campaign trail for Democrats. Former President Barack Obama has been campaigning down in Georgia and it's really coming down to the wire. Now the Cook Political Report, nonpartisan of course, they say that Republicans have the upper hand in the House of Representatives and all the polls suggest that the economy high inflation really tilting independent voters and mobilizing Republicans to get to the polls. It's typical mind you for a first term president to lose control of one of the chambers the House of Representatives at this midterm election cycle. But the Senate is anybody's guess and New York Times Sienna has a new survey out in key battleground Senate seats. Remember 35 Senate seats are up for grabs this cycle. 12 for Democrats or Democrats are defending 12 and 23 for Republicans. In Arizona, Mark Kelly, Democrat leading Blake Masters, 51 to 45 percent in Pennsylvania, Dems Up 6, Federman leading us, 49 percent to 44 percent. Those polls are tightening in Georgia, Dems Up 3, Rafael Warnock leading her shall walker. We all know the scandals that have been plaguing the Walker campaign, 49 percent to 46 percent. But in Nevada, a complete political deadlock, incumbent Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, neck and neck with her Republican challenger Adam Laxall at 47 percent of peace. So again, the Senate, I control the Senate right now, hanging on Vice President Kamala Harris having that key tie breaker vote. But it's really anybody's guess how this comes down in just a week from tomorrow. But I do want to know this is important and part of a larger historical trends here in the United States. More than 20 million Americans have already cast their ballot as a result of pre-election voting. 46 states are already accepting votes. So again, early access voting, voting before pre-ballots, all of that is having an effect here as well. Yeah, definitely. And then there's also, of course, this sort of stories on the periphery that have been affecting the discourse around the election, right? And that has to do with what happened with Paul Pelosi, a security and issue following the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband. What is the latest that we know there? Because there's also been, as we know, some misinformation out there. Some new developments in terms of where this security case is now leading. We're expecting for an arrangement to happen sometime earlier this, or sometime early this week in San Francisco. Her accuser Paul DePave is set to be arranged later this week on multiple charges, truly, including a tentative homicide. Over the weekend, on the Sunday shows Senator Amy Klobuchar speaking to NBC News is Meet the Press, in which she called for additional security for elected officials and their families.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,11,2022-10-31 14:33:54
4413," the press and which she called for additional security for elected officials and their families. Now, this is something that quite frankly has been discussed on behalf of both parties in recent years as political violence in America has increased and there could be eventually a tiered system. So, a clobochar suggesting that if you're not in line to succession of the president of the United States, that perhaps your family would be able to work with local security officials or local municipality officials. But it has reopened this broader discussion about security for elected officials, one that we saw percolate during after the January 6th attack. And it has raised questions about discourse in American politics. Now, Kevin McCarty, one of the top Republicans in the House of Representatives, he spoke out on the Sunday shows and said that it's not fair to label all Republicans who are looking to replace Speaker Pelosi until control backs of Republicans as those who have or are a part of the attacks. But he also has suggested that perhaps increased political rhetoric ought to cool down a bit as become to the final spread of the midterm elections. Kevin, you're also watching the Fed meeting. Yes, what's going to, oh yeah, the Fed, right? What's going to happen this week, this Wednesday, when the Fed meets? And especially in terms of the December rate hike, you know, look, record high inflation, wage growth, not necessarily where it should be. And an economist talking about a recession, if we're not already in one for some time for next year, when you juxtapose that from my neck of the woods here in Washington, DC with what policy makers are going to be forecasting after the midterms in a lame duck session, for example, it's going to be anybody's guess to see what just the path that lawmakers and both parties take to try to get out of what feels at this point like an inevitable recession. Well, Kevin, pop culture and sports culture are using a different recession indicator. That is the Philadelphia Phillies here. What's going on right now? I have heard about this. I don't know how I feel about this, but I think that it's good news. I also want to say that I'm wearing my Eagles green because we are still still on the feed it. Fly Eagles fly all the way. Kevin, so really, we appreciate the update here. We're going to check back in throughout the World Series as well. You bet it. Guys, coming up, we're going to break down some of the big calls of the day on the other side, including a double downgrade to Haynes brands. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,12,2022-10-31 14:38:32
4414," Much less scenes followed by Carla زinez's Let's talk about some other movements right now. These prompted by calls from analyst Haynes Brands in particular getting some attention. The stock got double downgraded from Wells Fargo. It's pretty rare to see a double downgrade. The analysts are sending concerns over the company's debt position and you saw the effect it is having on the stock with it trading lower by nearly 5% today. So basically underweight from an overweight, that's why we call it a double downgrade. And that the macro outlook could prove problematic for the company as well. That's what the analyst is saying. And that maybe management can't do anything about it if indeed things are going badly in the broader economy. And that's why the company's analysis could be very simple. And I would say this falls under the radar here of Haynes Brands. Now what's the Haynes Brands website? They're selling a 10 pack of boxers for $29. I mean, that to me is very, very sharp pricing and comes alongside a quarter where they just exited a couple of months ago where they exited with too much inventory in the channel. And it's not just box or briefs and tidy wideies. It's also champion. Champion has been a big growth driver for Haynes Brands for some time. That sales for that brand has now started to fall off a cliff. And that's also leading to more inventory issues, not surprised by this. And I want to be shocked when Haynes Brands reports very shortly here that they might warn again. And it is challenging to push forward a company like Champion to operate more of the brick and mortar retail experiences at a time where the consumer is being perhaps as Wells Fargo is calling it more cynically here, reacting more cynically within where they are purchasing and where the discretionary dollars are being put to use. So that all leading to Wells Fargo to slash their estimate, 30% below consensus 2023 earnings per share. I am a little surprised that you wouldn't think that something like a Haynes Brands would get a benefit from a trade down effect. But I guess if people are making the decision to buy less overall, maybe the underwear replacement cycle, I don't know. I'm like a software player. You want to go there? No, I mean, you know, like how often do normal people typically rebuy these types of buying underwear on a regular basis, you can't keep using the same style stuff. Of course, but I guess what I'm saying is I wonder what that typical cycle is and then does it get lengthened in times of economic hardship? You were just continuing dirty feet up underwear. I need to read a white paper about this. She's a brat, you better go to Paramount. Yeah, we're going to talk about Paramount because Paramount because the buying bottom for socks means you're wearing more holy socks out there. Guys, also let's talk about Paramount here. You're taking a look at shares. We're going down 5% right now after Wells Fargo downgraded the media giant from equal weight to underweight, saying, cord cutting concerns have worsened. Yeah, they have. That's actually kind of showing up in some of the results that we had seen start to come through last weekend and really on the telecom providers. Those that offer internet services where they're seeing subscribers or the combination of internet services and cable subscriptions. We saw this in Comcast. If you're seeing more people actually cutting the cord, what does that also mean for some of the core companies that have relied on either their content or going into or being licensed out? And Paramount is one of those major companies that would rely on a number of people keeping their cords at least for the time being while also mounting their own type of subscription plays in their future too on the streaming front. Yeah, Paramount stock had a pretty good September. And I'm not surprised. I think back to CEO Bob Bakish talking to our very own alley canal at the All Market Summit, struck a bullish tone on their business moving forward. Stephen K. Hall is the analyst that wrote this note over at Wells Fargo, probably one of the best media analysts in the grand game. In addition to what you mentioned, Brad, he also notes, we see opportunities for Paramount to unlock value, but don't think they're currently under consideration. And I would imagine that be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,13,2022-10-31 14:42:46
4415," Media analysts in the grand game, in addition to what you mentioned, Brad, you also notes, we see opportunities for Paramount to unlock value, but don't think they're currently under consideration. I would imagine that be more asset sales. Paramount has moved quickly under this new management team to sell off very assets. I believe they're a book publishing business. They sold off a year and a half ago or so. Net doesn't look to be under consideration, and Stephen doesn't like it. Yeah. And if the company doesn't do those things that he suggests, he says the valuation should be closer to its peers like Warner Brothers Discovery or Fox. All right. From streaming to dirt, and finally shares of Caterpillar are in focus after you've asked downgrade the stock to neutral from buy, but maintaining an upbeat outlook on the equipment maker long term and surprise surprise. This comes against the backdrop of more lockdowns in China, which of course is a key market for Caterpillar. Yeah, they were saying that the thesis won positive margin inflection is playing out. And particularly there, some of the part, the positive trajectory for margins and earnings growth from here is reflected within this downgrade. And so within that, they're expecting sales and margins to grow through 2024, 4% of head of some of the consensus EPS for that year too. Yeah, this is after the quarter they had that was a pretty darn good quarter. Pretty good quarter. But, you know, we'll see what ends up happening going forward now. All right. Coming up next, process is going to join us to bring down his takeaways from this year's watch time event in New York City. We need a little break from the doom gloom, don't we? Yes. Share. As we said earlier, it's not timing the market. It's time in the market. And how will you tell time if not with a beautiful watch? That was a bad side guy. Sorry. Hi, and watchmaker showed up new luxury time feces during this year's Watch Time event in New York City. This is the all-important Christmas season approaches. The market their AMIAT might surprise you during this take away from the event.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,14,2022-10-31 14:47:16
4416," this year's Watch Time event in New York City. This is the all-important Christmas season approaches. The market they're aiming at might surprise you. Joining us with takeaways from the event is Yahoo! Funded says Prosse to Baraniah. Pros, it's interesting, like it feels a little weird to be talking about luxury watches right now when we're talking about economic slowdown, but there's obviously still a market. Yeah, big time market, especially in certain pockets of the world, you know. We went through this event. This is the biggest watch event in these coasts back in full force here after the pandemic. It's mostly a bunch of large brands, even some small and up-becoming brands, but what's going on in the industry? One big trend we saw, their laser focus on the resilient and growing US market, Ron Stahl of Carlisth Beaker told us about that. The US is on fire again. You know, the US came out of COVID and watches are back at an all-time high. The excitement, the enthusiasm, I mean, America's really driving the watch market from all angles. You might remember Carlisth Beaker who they were in the John Wick film, so I said, watch as he wore amongst all the bad guys. Anyway, the strength in the US for traditional markets like Asia slowed down a bit because of the pandemic. Another effect of the pandemic, supply chain issues, even in the specialized watch industry. Jules English shoes, the Coffin or Bremen a big British watch brand, told us about that recently and how hard it is to meet demand. Any supply chain out there, if I wanted to get a seal for a watch, it used to be six months and that was 18 months. So that's why even more important that we manufacture more global currency is a challenge. The strength of the dollar. So if you're buying anything in dollars or anything in Swiss, Frank, which mirrors the dollar, that's definitely a challenge. But you have a natural hedge by selling in US dollars, so that's important for us. So you have Bremen, they had their new Supernova watch there, which is an in-house movement, which is a big deal for a small watch brand to devote the R&D to make that kind of bespoke in our movement for a watch that might sell only in the thousands. I mean, these watches look good. And clearly that there is some resilient demand from the higher income or more affluent consumers out there. What is really driving some of the demand right now from what they were telling you? You know, it seems like a lot of it is kind of like a bunch of factors, you know, you have new collectors coming in, you have people kind of driving, that kind of sat out the pandemic, didn't spend any money on travel and things like that. So they kind of got interesting watches. They got a hype watch effect on Instagram, kind of have those must-have watches, what people are sort of lusting after. And it's jewelry, it's driven by men, but also young people, also women. There's a lot of women at the show compared to last year, so a lot of collectors out there. So we spoke to the CEO of Oors, which is a kind of a story Swiss brand that's been around for a long time. They were privately owned by Swatch, they're private now. Having a big moment now, it's a newly cool kind of watch. So here's what Ralph's student had to say. He's the co-CEO. Well, all indicators basically are red, right? Inflation, the economy slowing down a little bit, but we don't see no stop at all. And I think it's related to the pandemic. People had a lot of time to learn about some mechanical watches, and it has become much more important topic in their lives. And they are ready to spend, still spend money on mechanical watches, spend more money on mechanical watches, because they know more, so no, at the moment, we really don't see any downturn as we did in other difficult times before. So no downturns yet. I did try on one of their watches with the Sam and dial Pro Pilot X Titanium Watch, beautiful watch, also an in-house movement, so that's a big deal for a brand-like horse. What do you call watches on TikTok? Like, is TikTok? Like, what is there a watch? Do you know what I mean? Is there a watch shot? Like, kind of said. No. Well, maybe that's it. I don't know. What do you, I think I've watching this, I'm thinking, remember when the Apple Watch came out, and everybody thought the Apple Watch would kill the watch industry, but I see this. I see a lot of innovation. As a watch guy, this is next level stuff here. Yeah, you know, it's funny. I thought the same thing, right? And I think there was a little effect with the Apple Watch a lot of people bought into it. What's the point having got an old watch? But I guess it's the same kind of feeling you get with an older classic car, for instance. You kind of like the fact that it's a very simple thing, a mechanical thing, it works on it, so you can work on it too. It's a lot of technology or technology. It's in from so far. All track.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,15,2022-10-31 14:51:27
4417," I guess it's the same kind of feeling you get with an older classic car, for instance. You kind of like the fact that it's a very simple thing, a mechanical thing, it works on it, so you can work on it too. So I think there's a little bit of an appeal or fascination with these older, you know, timepieces that can actually last hundreds of years if you care for them. It was a great analogy, especially for the classic car guru here. That both of you are. It's probably thanks so much for taking the time. Excellent work. Take it the time. Oh, man. The hunts just take it. So, all right guys, we're running out of time here for this segment. We're coming up. Taylor Swift, yeah, T. Swizzley sets a record with her new album, and New York City goes full pay transparency. We've got all the drama, the Deeds, next in Cut for Time and Full Review of the first six songs. Let's go. Welcome back, Time to Cut for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this on the day. Ford is looking to shake some slack out of its workforce. According to an internal email obtained by the Wall Street Journal, the company told managers that certain staffers could take severance rather than enroll in the company's performance enhancement plan. Some of the early inclinations of that plan were laid out in this most recent earnings report and conference call that took place thereafter as well when they had talked about some of the restructuring that was coming forth as well. Yeah, I can't say this is really surprising. I think this is a company very much in transition, splitting up internally how it does certain things, trying to, it's splitting its business between a gas power operation and electric operation. And this is to be expected. They're going to have to move a lot faster. And it's not just Ford, it's GM if they want to compete even more effectively with Tesla. I mean, I think in this new era, right, we got used to a very robust job market for a long time. And now that things are slowing down, we're going to get different companies coming up with different creative ways to shrink their workforces, whether it's offering severance to some workers or other methods, we're just unfortunately going to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,16,2022-10-31 14:55:51
4418," We're going to get different companies coming up with different creative ways to shrink their workforces, whether it's offering severance to some workers or other methods. We're just unfortunately going to have to get more use to these kinds of stories. I think in our conversations with Ford too, we've consistently asked the CFO John Lauer about where some of those changes might need to be made with regard to that new restriction. Absolutely. All right, New York City will require companies with at least four employees to post salary ranges in job listing, starting Tuesday. This is part of its effort to increase pay transparency. There's no fine for a first time offense, but companies found to violate the law could face civil penalties of up to $250,000 if not corrected within 30 days. Good. Good to see it. There are a lot of implications of this law, not least of which is that more data presumably will then be available to figure out what pay is for various industries. There's been people-led efforts on this, or you can go on certain websites and see, but this is really a good step forward in figuring that out. And it's significant too in understanding better where those salaries that are still being advertised or discussed. And number one, bringing it up to parity across certain roles where there has been so much of a discrepancy or a disparate amount of payment and compensation that's going forward. And some of that is going to help employees be able to negotiate better in all these positions. But not necessarily gotten the same, you know, this way companies have to be very upfront about those kinds of things. Totally sport this mode. New York City. See you. All right. And Taylor Swift is now the only artist to sell at least a million copies in a single week for five different albums, her latest album Midnight. Sold one and a half million copies across formats, notching the third largest streaming week ever for an album and the biggest sales week since Adele's 25, seven years ago. We got the Brad Smith, we were privy to the Brad Smith quick review this morning. It was not terribly enthusiastic. Not takeaway. This will not be the first Taylor Swift concert that I decided to go to based on this album. And here's why anti hero. Sure. Getting a lot of conversation. Ultimately, I could remake the instrumentals probably in garage band. The vocals for track one, solid drop futuristic form, the floor vibes. Vocal sound like it was recorded in the bathroom though. And several of the other tracks sound the same way on the vocals front. I'm upset at the engineering it a little bit, but again, this is not the one that I'm going to say. I can really add to that, is this music all sound said? Now I don't want to be said. I've always been T-Swift agnostic and this album does not change that opinion. I'm mostly just not a pop girl, so this was never going to be an album for me. Yeah. Get the tissues in the candy ready. Is that what I'm going to need? You got to get that Reese's after the show. All right, folks, that does it for us today. Coming up in S-Prize, we're going to continue our conversation around Twitter with Lightset, Shadow Partners, Rich Greenfield. He is always an interesting guy to listen to. I'm going to start. Everybody listen to that. Great.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,17,2022-10-31 15:00:08
4419," Next<|pt|><|translate|> Welcome to Yahoo Finance. It's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm in S for a in for a key GoFuGita here is what I'm watching today tweeting up a storm. It's Elon Musk's first full week in charge of Twitter and there are already reports of layoffs and changes to the blue checkmark verification system. We'll discuss what may lie ahead also. COVID chaos Shanghai Disney abruptly closing over COVID concerns with visitors unable to leave until they test negative for the virus will bring you the latest and black Adam is a hit. The Duane, the drop Johnson action flick week at the top of the bo down the weekend box office first, let's take a look a right now. We are watchi lower. You're looking at down more than a hundred 500 and the Nasdaq also also energy today and we' I and crude oil, Brent Cr that is lower as well. month that I was in the to preview what to watch in Yahoo finances, Alex Jared Blicchery. Alex, with you, so we're watchi this week. Yeah, and as policy move and October's on Friday are going to start to November trading events are going to determine that we have seen in October the rest of the year now. expecting another 75 basis on Wednesday. There's very when it comes to the actual but they'll tune into what afterwards and where FOMC with their economic pro been seeing some signs in economy is showing signs with the jobs report out payroll gains to fall be a thousand number. We've seen some of the kind of renewed optimism that the Fed may scale back and pivot sooner than ex is actually saying not just Goldman Sachs and Bank of saying that investors should any hawkish whispers out of officials begin those dis come out and assert that they're going to be seeing a lot of the rain and infl with aggressive tightening. This moment feels kind of like July and August. We saw investors hoping for a p in September when J. Powell came out and Jackson Homes and that that wouldn't ha and Jared a lot will ride of course on what J. Powell says this week. But October was among that some were expecting a crash not so. But it's going to be a crash. So that's a quite a few years. However, you go to the NASDAQ and it's the office of story. It's only the best October since last year. So let me show you how this is breaking down. Here is the Dow. It's up 14% over",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,18,2022-10-31 15:04:34
4420," However, you go to the NASDAQ and it's the opposite story. It's only the best October since last year. So let me show you how this is breaking down. Here is the Dow. It's up 14% over these 21 trading days right here. You can see that on your screen. And now I want to post the returns for the NASDAQ down about 1% today. It's up only about 3%. I think investors will still take those gains, but it just shows you how this has kind of been a bifurcated market. And if I step inside the market, you can really see a difference between the high flyers and the losers here. This is what's going on today. Let me just change this to a one month view. Energy up 26% followed by industrials, 14 financials, 12 materials, 9.8% health care staples also right there with it. These are some big gains for what are traditionally the more value sectors of the market. Everything's in the green, but communication services. That's what houses met. I guess what that is taking up the rear. That is still up about half a percent. Now you take a look inside the NASDAQ and you can see some outsize winners and also outsize losers. Apple up over 10% Amazon down per 10% Tesla down 15 metadown 30%. But you put all this together and I think a lot of it is going to hinge on what happens with the currency situation in us. And speaking of the currency situation, what's happening with the Brazilian brawl because we had the elections in Brazil, Lula de Silva, who was president from 2003 to 2010 has won that election. So now he will be doing a third term. He had served two consecutive terms before. He's seen as a leftist, but more moderate. So where are currencies right now because the rail has done well against the dollar? Yes, it has. And here is the month to date on the on the Wi-Fi interactive showing that the US dollar is actually sunk about 3% over the month of October versus the rail. And that's versus gaining versus a lot of these other currencies. You can see in the upper left up 7% versus a rubles 6.7% of the Argentine peso. So what I want to point out is the Brazil was actually hiking race. They were the first among all the developing companies and the developed company countries. Excuse me, who began raising rates and that was earlier in 2021. So going back to let's say March, they were raising rates in a time where most people were cutting. Most people in the Fed were talking about the transient inflation and they were taking the seriously. As a result, they haven't suffered as much pain as a lot of the other currencies. And I'm not just talking developing market currencies. I'm talking the developed ones like the yen and the euro. And just a circle and put a nice bow on everything with respect to the Federal Reserve this Wednesday. I think this is going to be pivotal because if J-Powell doubles down on his strategy on the Jackson Hole saying we are going to hike no matter what in the face of all this and doesn't really stand down, doesn't use those words and there's going to be a lot of questions. I just hesitate to think what's going to happen for the risk markets because a lot of this perceived dovishness is already baked into that. Jared Blyckery and Alexander Samanova, thank you so much for joining us. And to that point, Jared, with the Federal Reserve set to raise rates by 75 basis points for a fourth consecutive meeting, investors are trying to battle the twin headwinds of recession risks and tighter monetary conditions. For more, let's welcome in Fred Hubeler, Creative Capital Wealth Management Group President and Chief Wealth Strategist. We're also joined by Gitu Sharma, Alpha's Future Founder and Investment Manager. Gitu, let's start with you. The Fed expected to raise rates by 75 basis points then in December, who knows if it's 50 or 25 basis points or if it's a pause there. What are you expecting and what are you expecting the markets to do? Hi, I agree with you. There's a lot of uncertainty out there right now and this week is going to be quite telling. The 75 bits rate hike in November is very much price-dilent and we can expect the Fed to give that. But December is looking, the market itself is not sure what December is going to be, but we have seen a bit more dovish expectations in the market. We've seen a very strong rally in equities and bonds. But I think there is a risk that actually the Fed, even if they want to keep that option of reducing the rate high-paced in December, I think that the Fed is actually not going to be as low.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,19,2022-10-31 15:08:39
4421," And if they want to keep that option of reducing the rate high pace in December, I think that the Fed is actually not going to be as dovish as the market is expecting. And there are a number of reasons for that. I think firstly, while the economy is slowing, which is what the Fed wants, we are not seeing the pace of slowdown as much as they would like to see. Inflation remains very high. And inflation expectations for the long term we saw the recent consumer expectations have actually come in higher. And so given how strong the US consumer is, the spending remains strong. And the other important metric that the Fed looks at, which is the unemployment rate, is actually the lowest ever. So as long as we have these conditions, I think the Fed is likely to stay focused on monetary tightening, because the last thing they want is the inflation expectations to get even more entrenched than what they already are. And Fred, are you expecting the Fed to stay hawkish? And if so, what impacts could we see? Because so many market watchers talk about this six to nine month lag time between what the Fed does and what we see in the economy. We already have seen what has happened in England with the pension funds and what the Bank of England has had to do. Do you see any cracks happening in other parts of the economy, whether it be here in the US or abroad? Yeah, we see a lot of cracks. And at the end of the day, the Fed's job isn't to make the market happy. And they have decided and have determined more than once. They're going to keep doing what they need to do to break inflation. The analogy we've been using with our clients is there's blood on the streets. It hasn't gotten to your door yet. So until the consumer slows spending, we're not going to see a lot of inflation tap down. People are still buying things. And once the consumer changes their, and they're starting to change their behavior, then the sales that companies are expecting won't be as much as they thought. And you're seeing it with mixed earnings in the third quarter. So it is a lag from consumer behavior rippling through the economy. The expectations for the market are almost always in their best interest and the market's best interest. So they want things to happen so bad. They talk about, they kind of telegraph what their intentions are. And I think the Fed's going to do what it needs to do. And I think there's pain that needs to happen that isn't yet reflected in all the numbers we're seeing. And the pain would be more job losses, companies slowing down growth, and maybe even doing some layoffs. And the cracks are almost everywhere. And there's not many places where between COVID, inflation, and the excess spending, and even what's going on in energy, all of those places are kind of happening at the same time. And what concerns us is more fixed income and equities. It's very frothy. And when we're supposed to have a bad month, we have the best month we've ever had. So the only thing good news is the Riyadhus git segment about watches makes me want to buy watches so we can spend some time looking at the markets. G2, just speaking to where investors should they be looking at watches or not, what do investors do here? How do investors position themselves? Because you say that international markets are really attractive on a pure evaluation basis. Are you suggesting going into international markets and what type of assets if so? Well, so I think international markets are attractive on a valuation basis, but we also have a higher risk of recession there. So I think the risk is higher in those markets, and that is what is getting priced in. So no, it's not that I'm absolutely recommending investing in international markets, because I think the US economy is very strong, and US companies are a lot more resilient, a lot more defensive, have higher pricing power. And we have a attractive dollar, which makes international markets less attractive in their local currency.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,20,2022-10-31 15:12:56
4422," And we have a we have a attractive dollar which makes international markets less attractive in their local currency. So no, I'm not recommending that, but it is something that we are watching. And you know, if we do see a recovery in the economic environment, we see a resolution to the war or some kind of supply chain normalization across China and other countries. And potentially we could see attractive opportunities that. And Fred, just quickly, your bullish on energy. Energy has done very well this year. You still see a runway there? So looking at the longer term, energy is the thing that makes modern society work. Now where we get it from is a whole other conversation. But at the end of the day, energy in more developing countries is not even where it needs to be for everyone to have what they want. So although we might not see, you know, we're kind of being more efficient with energy use in, you know, in North America, that's the energy isn't even getting where it needs to be over places. So at the end of the day, I think the, you know, the use of energy exploded 16 times in the 1900s. The growth of energy is what makes modern life possible. So when you're looking at what can't go wrong, we all need to plug into something. And so, you know, recessions, people still need to want to have their lights on that are heat. Now where it comes from is a longer conversation. But at the end of the day, I think there is always going to be demand for energy. And with what's going on with you train and Russia, it makes it more of an awareness that, you know, energy is national security. And we need to make sure that as a country and countries around the world need to make sure they have the energy. If they have the deposits, they have the way to get that out of the ground for their own self interest. Gitu Sharma, Alpha's future founder and investment manager and Fred Hubler, creative, capital wealth management group president. Thank you both for joining us today. And now for our trending ticker of the day, GameStop. The video game retailer Stock is up today. The stock is up 23% actually over the last five sessions, breaking the $28 level on Friday. And short interest on this stock is just about 20%. That's high. Bob Sloan, the CEO of Data Analytics firm S3 partners recently told Yahoo Finance. If the stock goes past 30, you could see something parabolic. And the stock is right now past 30. In fact, it was halted for volatility earlier this morning. And coming up, Shanghai Disney have rapidly closed in order to comply with COVID measures, with visitors unable to leave. Stay tuned for the latest..............",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,21,2022-10-31 15:17:12
4423," its China's COVID-19 curbs force the closure of Disney's Shanghai Resorts, so it could comply with COVID-19 prevention measures. Park visitors present at the time of the announcement were required to remain until they return a negative test. That's a latest public health measure as rising case numbers from outbreaks across China have prompted a tightening of local curb and lockdowns. Yahoo, finances, Angelie Kamlani joins us now with the latest, Angelie, these COVID lockdowns really continuing to create problems in China. That's right. And Disney just being one of the latest to have to deal with that. This coming after 10 cases reported locally in Shanghai as local transmission, forcing the government to start that strict lockdown of that area, of course, with mass crowds. As of right now, we do know that the park, it will be indefinitely closed. Those who are already in the park do have to return a negative test. There were already strict measures in place, and the park had just reopened at the end of June. And so those who are stuck inside are dealing with the same restrictions that were in place, which is a negative test, at least 72 hours before entry, or no entry for those who had traveled abroad or who were living domestically in high transmission areas. Right now, the park site says that it's uncertain about when it will reopen. And so those ticket holders who are looking to visit with the next coming days and weeks are going to have to contend with either rebooking at a time once they know an opening date or asking for a refund. So that's where things stand right now. And Angelie, speaking of coming days and weeks, let's take a look at COVID and the variance and what's coming for this winter. What should people watch out for here in the U.S.? So we've seen something interesting kind of happen over the weekend and tracking these variants. We know there's the XBB that's taken hold in Singapore as well as other countries, including India and Bangladesh. And we've seen an interesting trend, which is not an increase in debt. So that's one positive sign. However, we have seen increased cases. Now we know that the QB1 and QB1 one here in the U.S. is already starting to grow nearly a quarter or actually past a quarter of cases now. So what this trends for in terms of how hard the winter will be is actually still unclear. And I know we've seen a lot of uncertainty. We've had guests on just prior to me talking about the uncertainty of the winter. And that holds true too for coronavirus. As we know, there's also the focus on the flu RSV and COVID circulating all at the same time. Things still uncertain, but experts really prompting or asking for individuals to stay cautious, remain cautious and take all the preventative measures possible. Angelic, Kamlani, tracking everything COVID related. Thank you, Angelic. And the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments today on a pair of cases that could decide the future of affirmative action in higher education. Yahoo, finances, Alexis Keenan has a details. Alexis, affirmative action is something that's been debated for years, but these cases are significant decades. Right? So this is a big deal. There are two cases that the Supreme Court is listening to oral arguments from two different universities as well as the challenger to this affirmative action law that we have right now in the United States. The action is brought by an organization called St. Louis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,22,2022-10-31 15:21:42
4424," Two different universities as well as the challenger to this affirmative action law that we have right now in the United States. The action is brought by an organization called Students for Fair Admission and along with a conservative activist who funds that group, his name is Edward Blum, they're saying that both the Constitution and civil rights laws prohibit universities from considering race and ethnicity as a factor in college admissions. So the two respondents here are Harvard as well as the University of North Carolina. Those are the two groups that are having to stand up and defend their policies in the way that they admit college applicants. Now in the University of North Carolina's case, that's a public university and then Harvard on the other side is a private university. So that's why you're getting some different laws being applied here with the petitioners saying that the University of North Carolina is violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment law. The 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, which says all the laws have to be applied equally. But then Harvard's case, they're saying that Harvard is violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and that bars organizations that take federal funds from using race as a discriminatory factor. So a little bit different argument there, but in the end the judges are going to have to decide whether or not they're going to overturn just decades and decades of law that has permitted universities to go ahead and include race as a factor and the arguments are already underway. That would be significant. The Biden administration also filed a brief in support of the university. So what's the argument there? So you have the Biden administration, you have corporations, you have professors at universities, you have a lot of Amicus briefs filed here, front of the court briefs, and they are proponents for the universities being able to continue using race as a factor. So I should also note that right now, Harvard is saying that 40% of universities in this country actually continue this practice and use race as a factor, not as the deciding factor. That's a big issue that the justices have already been asking questions about. So what the corporations, the Biden administration are saying is that if you take this away, if you take this fuel for diversity away at the university level, that then you're going to impact the corporate level as well as the federal level and including the US military, they say all of these institutions need diversity and they're better by having this diversity, better equipped, more efficient, will impact US business and they say we need to get that in at the university level because that's from where we're recruiting. For our future business leaders. The fascinating will be watching Alexis Keenan. Thanks so much for joining us and coming up changes to Twitter Elon Musk already talking about changing the blue check mark verification system will discuss what else he might have in store. Stay with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,23,2022-10-31 15:26:05
4425," [♪ music Starts outwards and pope music begins one by one. Ewan Musque wasting no time making changes at Twitter, reportedly working and tweeting in the weekend. The recent staffed remains done for cause could present the company with another firestorm joining us now with Insight Rich Greenfield, partner and media and technology analyst at LightShed Partners. Rich, thanks so much for joining us. Let's start with some of what happened over the weekend on Twitter. The verge saying that Twitter is charging is going to charge $20 a month for verification. What do you make of that? Look I think that there's a lot of power users of Twitter that would clearly pay businesses, you know, a lot of creators that use this as a business and use Twitter. I mean, you see a lot of influencers on social media. Twitter is where they speak to their fans and so is there a large group of people that use Twitter, you know, from a business aspect and would absolutely pay every brand in America or every brand around the world, looks to see what people are saying about their brand. I don't care whether you're dealt to airlines or your HBO, you're listening to what Twitter is saying. And so are there lots of organizations and people that would pay for Twitter as part of and sort of a premium product or premium tier with analytics and information, including a blue check mark? Absolutely. We've been talking about a subscription business for years. You see, they rolled out Twitter blue last year or over the last 12 months, which is certainly a step in the right direction. But I definitely think there's a bigger opportunity, you know, a tweet deck is something that's never been monetized. There's a lot of parts of Twitter that sort of are begging for better monetization than just purely being advertising supported. So I like the idea whether the price point is right, whether the actual product that he's envisioning is the right ultimate product. I don't know. He's only been there a few days. But I do think that a subscription business makes a lot of sense to tack on to Twitter. What about on the advertising side because Elon Musk had tweeted out a letter to advertisers? Do you see changes there? You know, you think about what Sheryl Sandberg did at Facebook, you know, now called meta. But if you think about sort of Sheryl's legacy at Facebook, I really think it's what she was able to accomplish at Instagram, where she effectively was able to turn advertising into content. When you were scrolling through, you know, this is sort of before reels. But if you just scrolled through your Instagram feed, so much of the content was so well targeted that the advertising often felt like content itself. And that's really the holy grail per marketer, right? Like, you advertise because you want people to actually love what they're seeing, not to disrupt it and torture them. I think so much of TV advertising is torturous. I think Facebook did it right and really figured out a better way to advertise. And so I think for the read Elon's letter, his goal or his aspiration for Twitter advertising is it for the field very native to the platform where it's not disrupt over, interrupt over the experience.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,24,2022-10-31 15:30:32
4426, his goal or his aspiration for Twitter advertising is it for to feel very native to the platform where it's not disrupt over interrupt of the experience and you actually like the advertising that you're seeing so I think that would be great. Again whether he can achieve it you know it's very early days I've seen a lot of not so great crypto ads and sports betting ads over the course of the last year on Twitter so he's got a long way to go but I love the vision. It's very early days but there is a lot of watchers out there on what Elon Musk will do with the staff at Twitter and we have seen headlines about the team that's building that $20 a month verification that they have to have that code by November 7th otherwise they'd be fired. There's a lot of quite a bit of headlines and comments about Elon Musk kind of being almost tough a very tough boss as he's coming into the company. What do you make of this? What are the challenges that he will be facing when it comes to any cuts at Twitter? You know the beauty of a private company is that you don't report to shareholders like you don't have public shareholders anymore to deal with you have one share holder in Elon Musk and so the ability to do things to do hard things potentially firing people potentially changing the direction of the company in terms of what products are focused on or not. This is the opportunity I mean I think there's a lot of companies that would love sort of to be private and to do sort of the hard lifting or the heavy lifting that is very difficult when you're trying to meet quarterly earnings estimates when you're trying to meet X Wall Street expectations going private and having the ability to sort of really invest in and theoretically you know just given the history of Elon Musk he should have access to some of the world's greatest engineering talent to bring into Twitter so there's tremendous opportunity ahead again whether he screws it up whether it works I have no insight I'm obviously not on the inside so I have no idea but I do think that there's a big opportunity to do things that Twitter hasn't been able to do as a public company. But do you think that the microscope is very much more so on Elon Musk more than ever because every tweet that he even replies to media reports he had tweeted out headline about a conspiracy theory about Nancy Pelosi's husband and the intrusion there at their home and then he erased that headline there's so much focus on everything that Elon Musk is tweeting right now more than ever. I'd say you know one of the things Twitter has been criticized for is having a CEO that didn't really use the product and you know certainly that was the you know that your chairman of the board who didn't use the product or board of directors like now you've got a CEO. Similar to when Jack Dorsey was running Twitter you have a really visible CEO who loves the product he uses the product aggressively he's clearly made some early mistakes there's no doubt about it hopefully those become smaller in numbers as they go forward but he loves the product and he loves using the product and you know even his following I mean look at his following versus Jack Dorsey he is dwarfed and so again I think the thing that sort of gets lost in a lot of the press coverage of Twitter Twitter is a pretty small product only 240 plus million people use Twitter on a daily basis there's billions of people multiple billions of people that use Facebook and Instagram every single day there's more people using Snapchat every day than Twitter Twitter's a relatively small product and I think the aspiration is always to be something that could be the world's town hall you're not achieving that with 240 million hot users you need billions of users and so can somebody who has a massive following help drive greater adoption of Twitter that's certainly the hope and so I clearly think or I could I really believe he's going to use his his megaphone that he now has to draw attention to the platform and to get far more people engage with Twitter than ever before and attention he is drawing with Elon Musk having 112 million followers rich Greenfield thank you so much for joining us partner and media and technology analysts at light shed partners thank you coming up midterm elections are just over a week away and we could see a change in who controls Congress will take a closer look at how each party wants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,25,2022-10-31 15:34:37
4427," Coming up, midterm elections are just over a week away and we could see a change in who controls Congress will take a closer look at how each party wants to change tax policy. That's coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next. Coming up next.

4428," at 13 percent, paychecks are only growing by around 4.5 percent right now. So the typical Americans paychecks just buys less, and this, it just makes sense why Democrats are likely to get pummeled in the elections next week. It's all about the economy. Thank you so much, Rick Newman. And no matter which party takes control of Congress, there could be big implications for your taxes. Joining me is Elaine Magg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Elaine, so picking up on that point that Rick was just making, if the Republicans gain the majority of the House and the Senate, how could this change tax policies? So Democrats are promising that they will build. And it looks like we're having some audio issues with Elaine. We'll come back to that later. And coming up next, Poland announcing a deal to build a nuclear power plant in yet to be determined location. Could this be the start of a turnaround for nuclear energy? We'll speak to the head of nuclear fuel technology development company next. Back with us now is Elaine Magg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute to talk to us about how the midterms could impact tax policy, Elaine. So if Republicans were to take the House and the Senate, what would this mean for people's wall like their taxes? In some cases, taxes would go down for a very high-income families. The Republicans would like to extend the permanently lower rates for high-income families and corporations. On the other hand, Democrats would like to deliver the extended expanded child tax credit that they had in place in 2021, which would be above an additional $1,000 for families for children ages 6 to 17.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,27,2022-10-31 15:43:26
4429," the extended expanded child tax credit that they had in place in 2021, which would be a bump of an additional $1,000 for families with children ages 6 to 17 and $1,600 for families with children from their age 6. The Democrats are also interested in pushing a larger earned income tax credit for workers, particularly those without children at home. Medicare and Social Security Republicans are interested in reducing those taxes and also reducing benefits. Democrats are interested in raising those taxes on very high income families to shore up existing benefits. And the final difference is probably just in the feelings about the IRS. The Democrats would like to deliver an IRS that collects all of the taxes owed. Presently, we collect about 85% of taxes owed. And even as recently as yesterday, prominent Republicans have said we should abolish the IRS altogether. And out of the tax initiatives that you just mentioned, of course, depending on who wins, which ones do you think will make it through? Is it the child tax credit from 2021 extending that? Would it be extending the earned income tax credit? If the Democrats win and get just one more vote, they'll be able to push the child tax credit. Biden has indicated it's a big priority. As of several key senators, it's the program that produced child poverty to its lowest level. We've seen in decades by about 30%. And what about public support for these initiatives because we are in an era of high inflation. So does the public support these initiatives, whether it be from Republicans or from Democrats? So the public indicated in recent surveys that they liked getting the child tax credit on a monthly basis, and they used it to pay for food and meet regular expenses. So I'd say there's plenty of support there. We just need enough members of Congress to push it through. The public does not tend to support cutting social security benefits or Medicare benefits. And so I think the plans that would shore up those benefits with high income families are more popular than delaying benefits. And then as far as the IRS says, I think people have mixed feelings. I think people believe that the IRS should work for them and do its job. And there's just it's not clear how to make that happen. No one wants to pay more taxes, right? Thank you so much. Elaine Mags, senior fellow at the Urban Institute. And Poland has picked the U.S. to build the Central European Nations First Nuclear Power Plant in an effort to burn less coal and gain greater energy independence. And the U.S. Prime Minister tweeting that a strong alliance between the U.S. and Poland, quote, guarantees the success of our joint initiatives. For more on the state of the nuclear industry, let's bring in Seth Gray, CEO of Lightbridge Corporation. Seth, you were part of the U.S. delegation to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which just wrapped up its ministerial meeting last week. Tell us what were some of the takeaways from that meeting? So it was sort of electrifying toward the end of the meeting when Secretary of Energy, General Hergrandholm announced the U.S. consortium led by Westinghouse to sell reactors to Poland. And a feeling, especially I think in leadership in Russia and China that the United States could not put together teams to sell large reactors overseas again. So to end conference within announcement of big U.S. reactor sales overseas with the U.S. government and industry working together to land that sale. And I think it was very important. I'd say that while climate change was a topic, the main topic of the conference was energy security. And certainly from the U.S. delegation and working with our allies, I had to make sure that they don't have to rely on Russia for their energy is much and that nuclear power is going to be a big part of that. And speaking of that, a nuclear power has really gone through a transformation, at least in perception. Are there still misconceptions out there about nuclear power? Which are they? There are some misconceptions, but it's amazing how Russia cutting off your energy can make you overcome some of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,28,2022-10-31 15:47:40
4430," out there about nuclear power, which are they? There are some misconceptions, but it's amazing how Russia cutting off your energy can make you overcome some of those pretty quickly, like we see in Germany suddenly extending the lives of reactors in other countries that had planned to shut them down. And I think that what is also happening to help people move in favor of nuclear energy is new technologies, new approaches that address the concerns like what we're doing at lightbridge with our advanced nuclear fuel technology. And speaking of what you're doing at lightbridge, you are hiring planning to hire additional technical experts. You talk about the nuclear power industry overall in a hiring spree. Can you tell us a little bit about that specifically in what areas? And also can you find workers in this labor market? Yeah, it's an interesting question for the new reactors being built a lot of these need skilled tradespeople. They need specialty welders, electricians, and people gaining those skills can have a bright future in an expanding nuclear power industry. For the companies designing new technology like lightbridge, we're looking at engineers, we're looking at scientists, and we're also working with national labs and universities that in turn are on a hiring spree. We're doing a lot of our work at Idaho National Laboratory, which is hiring a tremendous number of technical experts right now, some of whom working with us as we'll be demonstrating our fuel technology there. And where do you see the nuclear power industry in the next five to ten years? Which countries do you think are the best positioned to take advantage of nuclear energy? Well, the United States has done a very good job at positioning itself to take advantage in terms of developing new technologies, new reactors here deploying them domestically, but also for exports and hence a lot of the jobs here for domestic and for export markets. But France is doing a good job expanding its nuclear power sector. South Korea is, again, this is an area that a lot of people who thought was going to be seeded to Russia and China, but the US and its allies are really stepping up. And I'll just mention one more in the United Kingdom. We're seeing a big push and a lot of new reactors being ordered and under construction. And you're seeing a big push, but what's the biggest challenge to developing nuclear energy right now? Yeah, I think the biggest challenge has been that the big reactors, like the ones the Westing House will deploy in Poland, can take a decade between the time the discussions start and this power on the grid. And they can cost billions of dollars. And just that amount of time and that amount of money is something that's hard for a lot of customers to do. So I think that moving to smaller reactors that can be built in factories and shipyards and then shipped to the site, deploy much more quickly at much lower cost is much better. Lightbridge is fuelless being designed to work in these kinds of small modular reactors to improve very economic safety, non-conferration, the kind of concerns you were alluding to when your first question about nuclear concerns that people have. So I think the biggest way to overcome all of this will be with these smaller, safer, cheaper, more rapidly deployed systems. Lightbridge CEO Seth Gray, thank you so much for joining us. Coming up, it was another big weekend at four block, black Adam, the weekend box office breakdown is next. Stay tuned. You don't want to miss it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,29,2022-10-31 15:51:56
4431," Trans CHEERING the black Adam has won the box office for the second time in a row for more on this weekend's box office at Let's bring in Alexander canal Alex. Hi, and as yes, the power of the rock are on Rotten Tomatoes of just 39% black Adam delivered in week to another 27.7 million of the domestic box office a drop of about 59% versus opening weekend. That's pretty standard for superhero films and despite that low critic score that I mentioned, the movie currently has an audience score of 90% and that's something that we've been seeing more and more of and that word of mouth from the audience seems to be driving interest so far. The movie has generated $111 million in domestic ticket sales 250 million globally, but it wasn't all about superheroes at the box office elsewhere in the world of movies ticket to Paradise held strong in its second weekend and additional 10 million just a 39% drop versus opening weekend. Analysts that I've spoken with have said that this movie could symbolize a resurgence of the romcom genre. Of course, we have the a list star power of George Clooney and Julia Roberts. These films are relatively cheap to make so perhaps we could see some more coming to the box office and for this film in particular, analysts expect some momentum to carry through the end of the year. And speaking of low budget films, let's talk a few successful horror films from this past weekend. We saw four crack the top 10, but I want to single out smile because it's been just a home run for Paramount another 5.1 million this weekend pushing tickets sales to a whopping 92 million. And that's right. So speaking of that Halloween, those horror films, they help boost really the post pack the boost post pandemic in the box office. Yeah, smile is just one of many examples of this when we speak about the horror genre in general, I spoke with box office pro chief analyst Sean Robbins. He told me that the horror genre has been particularly resilient, especially post COVID. If you take a look at the top 13 horror films that have abused the pandemic, they've represented about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,30,2022-10-31 15:56:38
4432," Farge Enra has been particularly resilient, especially post-COVID. If you take a look at the top 13 horror films I have debuted since the pandemic, they've represented about 10% of movie-going attendants during opening weekends. That's according to analytics platform intelligence. The audience for these films, they skew mostly younger, and that's been a huge factor. As we saw that younger audiences were the first to return to theaters. Now, for these movies that you're seeing on your screen, about 53% of the audience was under the age of 35, and that younger demographic is what's really going to push theaters in the long run. They're also inexpensive to make, as I mentioned previously, low risk, a low threshold to success. I hate to keep talking about smile, but this is a prime example of this. It costs 17 million to produce. It debuted to 22 million, and now we see nearly $100 million in ticket sales. So, these types of films just prove that they can be successful any time of year, and they can be really easy entry levels to success when we think about the box office overall. And the producers of those films, they're smiling right now. Exactly. I love it now. Thank you. Yes. And speaking of Halloween, it's time now for our Halloween, the Med Chart of the Day. Today, we're focusing on one of the most divisive candies of them all. Yeah, that's right. The candy corn. The National Confectioners Association asked Americans how they eat candy corn. Here's what they said. 33% say they start with a narrow, white end. 16% say they start with a yellow bottom. But most 51% say they just eat the whole thing as is. And I have those candy corns right here. I didn't open them. I haven't had these since I was about 10 years old. This isn't commercial for them, but I would say I eat the top part first, the white part. Let's take a look at the market check right now. The Dow flipped into green earlier right now around the flat line. S&P in the Nasdaq is lower. Thank you for joining us. I'm in Esperade.

4433," The growth is looking to fast track is entry into the US cannabis market by creating a new holding company to house its US cannabis investments. Cattabee Growth CEO David Klein joins us now. David, welcome to you on this Friday morning. I was talking to an executive at Constellation Brands, an investor in your company. They said from their perspective, this is a win, win, win. Why is this a win for you? This is a win for us because it allows us to put together three really strong cannabis companies in the US under this canopy USA umbrella and begin to address the $50 billion opportunity that is the US cannabis market. David, it's been tricky because of the interdiction on a federal level against marijuana in the United States versus what we have seen in Canada. You guys, not just you, but many of the cannabis companies have done, had to do some real gymnastics to get around all of that. Tell us on a concrete level what this means for you, how this enables you to access that opportunity you're talking about. I think the important point is that we are putting together strong branded opportunities to address that US market. We need to do so in a way that allows us to ensure that we are keeping our investors like Constellation safe from any potential risks that they may have. We think that allows us the ability to the flexibility to actually be more aggressive as we address the US market and in the structure that we've outlined creates that security for investors like Constellation. David, it's been a while since we talked to some of the team at a canopy. We were familiar with prior management, very much ran canopy like it was the Wild West. But you were the former CFO of Constellation Brands. Talk to us about the financial discipline. Any new executives your team have put into the company? Yes, so we talk about ourselves as pioneers because there are challenges that present themselves on a day-to-day basis in this really tricky market. But we think it's really important to focus on execution, which is why we love this canopy, USA structure because it allows businesses that we already have an interest in like A.C.A.G.W. and Jetty to begin working together to extract costs to energy across the business, to extract revenue opportunities across the business as the US market opens. And then clearly as we apply that to Canada, the Canadian market continues to evolve. We continue to have to differentiate ourselves versus a growing competitive set. And I think that is just execution on a day-to-day basis. And it's really not about driving the story of cannabis anymore. It's about executing the business of cannabis. Do you believe that we will see passage of the marijuana banking bill and other legislation that allows for the cannabis industry and for your company to experience the growth that it's anticipating and tapping into this market in the US? Look, there are five more states that have cannabis on the ballot for legalizing adult recreational use this fall. So, and already two-thirds of Americans live in a state where or locale that where cannabis is legal in some form. We need the federal government to catch up. And there's just a lot of momentum building there. We've seen bills in Congress, both houses of Congress, both parties, and then a bit of a breakthrough a few weeks ago when the administration announced the beginning of their support for what we believe will ultimately be full of federal permissibility. David, in Canada where there is more broad legalization and permissibility, the market hasn't quite turned out to be as profitable as you and your peers might have hoped for. How do you think the US should maybe take some lessons?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,32,2022-10-31 16:04:59
4434," The market hasn't quite turned out to be as profitable as you and your peers might have hoped for. How do you think the US should maybe take some lessons away or what would you hope for if and when we do get full legalization that is different from the Canadian model? Well, I think one of the things we can do in the US currently is we can talk to our consumers and we can educate our consumers and we can talk about what cannabis is and it's a legitimate and important consumer product and I think being able to just connect with our consumers a little differently in the US market would be a differentiator versus Canada. But as it relates to Canada, we still think the market opportunity in Canada is an outstanding opportunity. Here it's a $7 billion industry versus the $50 billion industry in the US but that is a very large market and we're still in the early days of the market really shaking itself out to be the market that we know what it will become. Respective of the quiet period that you are in right now ahead of earnings, I got a wonder, you know, naturally for the larger space, how the cannabis industry at a whole is managing through a higher operational expense environment and what that potentially means for just having the financial cash flow in order to whether navigate even through some of the transitions that you're seeing here. Yeah, clearly every company is fighting the battle for us with the cost inflation and supply chain disruption. For us, we've been able to manage through it nicely across our businesses. We've had some supply shortages in our stores and Bickel vaporizer business but for the most part, we've been able to manage through with good planning and focus on execution. But we're in the same boat I think that every other industry is in. All right, I'll leave it there. Canopy Grout, CEO David Klein, good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Let's also talk about some of the stocks that we were talking about a lot more earlier in the year. We're talking about meme stocks. Our next guest was one of the few who saw last year's short squeeze of GameStop coming before it happened. With this company's data analytics can help investors avoid surprises from market structure and hopefully find the next big short squeeze from where we welcome in Bob Sloan, S3 partners, CEO and managing partner. Bob, thanks for being here. Just because a company has high short interest doesn't mean there's going to be a squeeze. But what are some of the conditions, if you will, that make a company?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,33,2022-10-31 16:09:24
4435," And just because a company has high short interest doesn't mean there's going to be a squeeze, but what are some of the conditions, if you will, that make a company or a sector or a collection of companies right for action like that? That's a terrific question. The main ingredient to a short squeeze is not the flawed short interest that you will see published on Google. The main ingredient of a short squeeze is how much or short sellers losing, and what's the upward momentum price action of the stock. As they lose more money, and you see the price action go higher, that is what causes a short squeeze. That is what S3 calculates, and that's why we're one of the most popular datasets in the world when it comes to measuring short interest flow and financing rates. Is there enough short activity right now, or short volume or float that's in the market right now to cause anything near the type of scale that we saw at the beginning of 2021? If you look at GME, I think there's still a billion to short in the stock. If this stock goes past $30, you could see something in Parabolic. Bob, I would say one of the conditions for the high-to-the-meam stock rally. A lot of people are home during the COVID pandemic. We get a recession next year. Do you think that sets the condition for increased trading activity? One of the things that I mentioned on the Netflix special that was done on GameStop, a lot of people have seen that, is this idea of Kardashian economics. If you think, if you look at the arc, the Kardashians are still here. If you look at the arc of that, apply it to socially mobilized investing and think that's going to go away, I don't think so. For some of the other industries that are further outbets and based on some of the more innovative technology, there's been more of the, how can we say, the arc trade, if you will. How do you look at some of the sector-based or even the innovation-based trades right now and considering that there's an alternative trade to even that in the short positions that have flowed in? There's also selling along positions, which is you could argue that the equivalent of a short position. One of the things that we have is a new product is looking at market structure and particularly on the long side. If you look at our new product, you'll see that meta is the second most popular holding amongst the hedge fund community. What will that do in return? So over the next quarter, I think we know the answer already. So those types of stocks, when you see persistency and holding over time and you see a down draft in the marketplace, you're going to see losses and that will affect where money moves. It affects how different strategies are composed. One of the things that really caught our attention was when David Einhorn came out and said value investing is dead. For us, that's like a profit coming down from the mountain and throwing away the tablets. It's just herosate. But what he's saying is that market structure is very important and it's not just the short side, it's the long side too and our new product solve for that. Bob, I want to go back to what you just said about meta. I see Amazon is also one of the most, has the most long positions next to meta. Spell that out for us a little bit more. What you were alluding to that even after that sharp decline, the 25% drop in meta on a single day basis, even after the 10% or so drop that we're seeing in Amazon today, is what you're saying? Does that imply that we could see more people get caught holding the bag and more selling exacerbated going forward? Yes, that's exactly what we're saying. Persistency of long positions, quarter of a quarter are quite high. So it is reasonable to assume that since if you look at the hedge fund cohort and see what the largest holdings are, it is very reasonable to assume that there are severe losses in portfolios today right now as we speak. Bob, thanks so much for taking the time here with us today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,34,2022-10-31 16:13:40
4436," that there are severe losses in portfolios today right now as we speak. Bob, thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. We really appreciate breaking it down and looking through some of the data that you're also tracking. you you you we ever in the history of our industry, so one day offer the best value simultaneously with the best network. And that day is kind of arriving. And customers are noticing. And it's so huge. I mean, you think about right now, customers are anxious. The economy has full, is full of questions. And what they're looking for is a great value from a brand they trust. And that's team mobile. Mike, I want to, I've talked to one of your computers recently. You said, you don't have Brian customers are laying paying their bills. Are you seeing that? No. In fact, bad debt levels look to us consistent with 2019 pre-pandemic levels. And 2019 was one of our best years ever. So we have seen it creep up from those pandemic levels, but only to one of our best years ever. So we're very interested in this. We're watching in voluntary churn. That's when people don't pay and have to leave. We're watching late payments. But so far, we're not seeing it in anything outside the norms. And you saw that in our overall performance, being the only one to reduce overall churn to just 0.888, 8 voices points less than year ago. Because people, when they come to team mobile, they're finding what they're looking for. Mike, you mentioned that consumers are anxious. These are strange times going into your ran. Are you seeing them trade down on what packages they spend for team mobile? No, but we are seeing a potential flight to value from other providers. And our competitors, our principal competitors, jacked a big price increases under their customers this summer. While those customers were locked in device repayment plans and could do nothing about it, where we reiterated price lock. The fact that when you come to team mobile, only you can change your plan. It's the uncontract. We won't change it for you. And that kind of trust that bond we have with our customers is really resonating right now. And it's one of the reasons why this quarter, we attracted more postpaid net additions than AT&T and Verizon combined. The sounds like a classic market share grab. Well, that's our strategy. For years, our principal growth strategy has been to grow our share methodically and through the power of our brand. The fact that we put customers first, that we love them, that we treat them right, we give them low prices. And now combining that with the leading 5G network, there is a real opportunity for us to resonate with a whole new audience of people that actually never gave us a serious look before.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,35,2022-10-31 16:17:59
4437," 5G network, there is a real opportunity for us to resonate with a whole new audience of people that actually never gave us a serious look before. Last time I talked to, I think you were still getting the 5G up and running. It was in some spots. What is it now and how is it different compared to Verizon 182? Well today our broad layer of 5G reaches 97% of Americans and our ultra-capacity 5G reaches 250 million people. If you asked for a comparison, that 250 million is where Verizon publicly stated they hope to be two years from now. Where do you see what's the next level of 5G? Where else does it roll out and what else you work on? One of the things is putting it to work or all kinds of new use cases. Magenta Max, which is our most popular rate plan, it's actually one of our higher end rate plans, happens to be our most popular because it's the best expression of that 5G network, truly unlimited usage on our network and customers are using it like never before. But also home broadband. Customers are using our 5G to power the internet in their entire home and they're tearing out cable and fiber to do it because we charge them $50.00 in zero cents. Our net ads and home broadband on 5G were more than the net ads on broadband for AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined. Did you leave anyone out? Well, it's interesting. We're comparing ourselves to everyone in the industry and what we're really interested in are net promoter scores, whether or not when those people come to us, whether they like what they have, where 30 points higher than cable and our net promoter scores are even higher than fiber. On, you also raised the, and we've had this discussion in the past, the amount of synergies from the sprint transaction, where are these synergies coming from and where's their, when does it peak out? Well, the principle place they come from is the network and we achieved a massive milestone in Q3, the substantial shutdown of the entirety of the sprint network targeted sites. So that is behind us now. In the run rate synergies, we increased in our guidance yet again as a result because that network shutdown happened more than a year ahead of schedule. There's still some room to run into next year, but as we finished 2022, most of those run rate synergies are now in the run rate. Every analyst I talked to on the street mic, they mentioned team models about ready to do a large share buyback. And when I talked to highlighted $60 billion potential from 2023 to 2025, are you still on that track? Well, that's what we said in our 2021 analyst day. And yeah, you know, our cash flow production has continued to come in in line with expectations ever since then. And so not only did we get that program started with a $14 billion buyback, but we started it early. And so in 2022, we're actively buying right now with a $3 billion program this year and an $11 billion program in 2023. And that's an expression of the confidence of our management and our board in the future. Before you let you go, speaking of confidence, you struck an upbeat tone on the metaverse on your earnings call. Now, it was a tough day for meta. It's not got slam, tough quarter, you know, a lot of focus on the metaverse on what it may be and what it may not be. How do you see it? Is it a big deal? Do you care about it? We do. And it's not all about one company either, even though they renamed their name to meta. It's about every company starting to live in the digital 3D world. You know, I just came from a CEO conference last week where I heard all kinds of companies making digital twins in manufacturing environments and training their employees in the metaverse while they're producing their actual factories so that employees can walk into that factory when the doors open, having lived in its digital twin for weeks during training. That's metaverse. So applications are here today in the enterprise and in the consumer side in gaming that are 3D digital imagery and that's fundamentally what the metaverse is all about. And it requires massive connectivity and low latency, exactly what T-Mobile's unique 5G network delivers. So that's my last question. How does T-Mobile make money off the metaverse? Is it through charging consumers in businesses? Well, a few ways. One is our most popular plan right now, magenta max also happens to be one of our higher end plans. So customers, unlike slamming them with price increases like our competitors, our customers are self-selecting up our rate card to get access to more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,36,2022-10-31 16:22:21
4438," one of our higher end plans. So customers, unlike slamming them with price increases like our competitors, our customers are self-selecting up our rate card to get access to more and more of what we offer. That's a win for us, but it's also a win for them because it's the best expression of the best 5G network. I thought Mike's comments, guys, on the Metaverse were very interesting. And I maybe adds another red flag to what Meta is building out. It's not just Meta's Metaverse, and they're investing billions of dollars to roll out this Metaverse and other companies could probably make money off it. And it has nothing per se necessarily to do with what Meta is doing. Right. It has a larger implication around the technology that's actually going to be used, the hardware that's going to be necessary for the Metaverse. Is it hardware that we already have? Is it an app-based solution like Roblox? Or is it actually via a VR headset? And it comes back down to what the consumer once in that experience, if you asked that to Bill McDermott, actually we did yesterday. And he believes that, yeah, there's opportunity for the Metaverse, all the companies are saying the same thing I might add to where, of course, Mike was just saying, and it runs on us. And Bill was saying, and ServiceNow will be there. There's this larger question of the user experience and what that will be from watching a fashion show or watching a concert in the Metaverse, all the way through to conversion and shopping activity that could also take place. And all the digital twin stuff, which is something that Nvidia has talked about as well, because there's lots of applications on the chip side too. I mean, do you think the other companies are a little annoyed with Meta for naming itself Meta? And they're all also in the Metaverse business? Maybe. Oh, we actually, we have to get our producer to kind of string all these comments together on the Metaverse. We got a mental no-furniture con. I know you're listening in. So just, you know, I can ask you one more thing, though, sauce, when T-Mobile touts itself as having improved its network and is stealing customers from the others, for a while, they're re-revealing. And we are still seeing it to some extent. This real promotion wars between the telecom companies. It's costing them, though. I mean, in the case of T-Mobile, what's its outlay look like? What are its margins look like right now as it is trying to get those new customers to join? Because it's trying to offer that value proposition. Well, they've been the only telecom, I would say, over the past year and a half to consistently raise their profit outlook because their revenue continues to come up to the upside. And they also continue to see billions and dollars of cost takeout or they're reducing costs in those legacy sprint assets. So that's what we heard from T-Mobile last night. They see almost $3 billion of cost cutting in those legacy sprint operations coming into the year. Maybe they were around $2 billion or so. I mean, that's huge upside for this company. Thank you. Chevron and Exxon has Jared reported or mentioned reported earnings this morning. And it's no surprise here. The world's largest oil companies crushed analyst expectations. Exxon posted almost $20 billion in profit. That is the best result ever for the company. Rival Chevron reported its second largest profit amid increased demand for natural gas. Do you want to get us now to discuss these results? We're just managing director for energy research, Neil.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,37,2022-10-31 16:26:46
4439," The company. Rival Chevron reported its second largest profit and it increased demand for natural gas. Joining us now to discuss these results is Tourist Managing Director for Energy Research, Neil Dingman. You know, Neil, I feel like every quarter we're saying are we at peak oil and here we are talking about record profits again. Is this as good as it gets? If you simply answer this now, I mean, to call these companies cash cows is probably an entertainment. I think I'd call them cash bulls. You all mentioned the earnings of the profit. We simply, I think the big factor being free cash flow. Chevron had a new quarterly record, almost 11 billion free cash flow. Exxon was just a touch under its record. Last quarter still generate over 17 billion in free cash flow. And what's unique about these companies is that they're good in the majority of this from the upstream while having some growth unlike most of my independence that are basically seeing no growth. And Neil, this energy crunch that we've seen, so many people talk about it as being something really structural that this is going to go on for years, countries trying to figure out where they're getting their energy from. So if this continues like this, are we going to be seeing more gains for these companies? Yes, I think especially for these diversified these companies that are not just purely domestic like obviously the two majors that if they can open up, Exxon talked about a new just a record amount of new LNG production they're talking about. They talked about new carbon ventures. There's just a lot of things that they're going to start doing that again, my smaller companies are not going to be afforded to as they sort of keep production flat. But the simple answer I think is absolutely that they will try to expand, but the simple answer is domestically as international especially Europe, the supply is just when it comes infrastructure is simply too tight. So that not the upstream is going to remain the challenge to the midstream. And Neil, it's worth pointing out this number that I thought was pretty incredible here. Exxon in this current quarter is forecast to post full your profit in excess of $50 billion. So if you look at that, that's more than Amazon, Proctor, and Gamble and Tesla combined, right? I mean, what a difference a few years makes when you think about where Exxon was before. This is a company and not just Exxon but Chevron too, obviously that is exposed to these cyclical swings. And obviously they have had a huge year. But when you think about where they're putting their money, you talked about some investments, they're also reiterating their share buyback. I mean, is that a smart use of money? When you think about where the lows have been for these oil giants and how far they've had to climb back up? Right, I think the simple answer is they have two choices. You can either expend it externally or as you said, either some sort of share all the return. And most of them, even including the majors, just say, okay, what would it cost me to go buy anything on the upstream, midstream infrastructure, new venture side? And on an asset value, what are my shares still trade for? As you said, even with all of the shares, like Exxon are basically at an all time high, the simple answer is still a lot of them that their shares are still trading at a significant discount on an asset value. So I still think it does. They're, you know, let me say though, they're not buying back near as much shares and paying near as much dividends as some of the independents, which are paying upwards of 75, 85, and 90% of their free cash flow out. So the majors do keep a much more optionality to do other things. And Neil, Kiko mentioned how these companies have really had to climb from the lows. I mean, back in 2020, you had oil negative. And it's hard to imagine that Chevron, Exxon mobile, now have a bigger market cap than Meta. So right now we're watching year to date, Exxon mobile is up 78%. Chevron's up 52% year to date. If investors didn't get into the stock earlier this year, is it too late or how do you see this in the next three to six months, especially if the economy goes into a recession? Symposiums, no, it's not too late. And why I say that is I've been talking to a lot of investors. And to me, out on the street right now, the biggest variable or the biggest sort of, you know, when you're looking at stocks, I think is free cashflow yield. And right now the energy group, even these two stocks today, dominate all their sector. I think right now in the S&P 500.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,38,2022-10-31 16:31:07
4440," I think is free cashflow yield. And right now the energy group, even these two stocks today, dominate all their sector. I think right now in this and P500, of the top 10 stocks in the five end, that seven are EMP companies as far as having the highest free cashflow yield. So I'm definitely aware of the run that all of them had, even Chevron X on included. But again, to me, it comes down to what the free cashflow yield, what you're able to do with that. And right now the energy sector still dominates all other sectors in that aspect. Sure as managing director for research, or energy research, Neil Dingman, good to talk to you on this Friday. A Wall Street is preparing for another 75 basis point rate hike coming in the next month. Now a new survey out of Bloomberg is showing economists expect interest rates to hit 5% by March of 2023. Joining us to discuss further, we've got Brian Relling, Wells Fargo Investment Institute head of global fixed income strategy. I'm good to have you in studio today. It feels like the 75 basis points is largely baked in for next week. The question is, what happens come December? Yeah, that's the big question in the market. And I think it's 50, 50 come December, whether they stay with 75 or they downshift to 50. I don't think the Fed's going to commit one way or the other next week. It's really going to come down to that data post-fed meeting, both the jobs report and most importantly, the inflation data we get around mid-November. Talk to us a little bit about we were talking during the break. Some concerns about liquidity in the bond market, which I've been following as far as the dollar has gotten higher, has risen, even though it's pulled back a little bit. Other countries perhaps not buying as many US Treasuries or selling their Treasuries to back their currencies. So is this a concern that you're watching? It is a concern. Both we're seeing, as you mentioned, the impact of other central banks, but also our own central bank doing their quantitative tightening, bringing liquidity out of the market. And it's becoming more and more over time, right? So it takes its toll. But liquidity typically isn't a problem until it is a problem. So I think the Fed will take the steps necessary to make sure the gears continue to run. So if there is just a complete liquidity drain somewhere, I think we can count on the Fed to step in and make sure things at least function properly. But yes, it is a concern, something we're watching pretty closely. And we've seen it at times in the high yield market. There was a short period of time where deals were having difficulty getting sold. As you mentioned, we've seen it other pockets, other places. But it's nothing at this point that's overly alarming, but there are some things to watch out for there, yes. What are that suggests in terms of where you think treasure yields are likely to move in you? The 10-year yield now below 4%, we've seen it a bit of a pullback.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,39,2022-10-31 16:35:28
4441," but there are some things to watch out for there, yes. What are that suggests in terms of where you think treasure yields are likely to move? The 10-year yield now below 4%, we've seen a bit of a pull back there. What do you expect it to go? Yep, so I expect that we're kind of in a process here over the next month or two as we wait for the Fed to downshift where rates are probably getting their highest levels that we're going to see. Have we hit the highs yet? It's hard to say for sure, but I do think we're going to hit them if we haven't already at some point over the next month or two. So I do think this is a time for investors to think about maybe locking in some of these rates for a longer period of time. As eventually we head into a recession inflation, moderates, I think we'll get to a point where rates start coming down. So locking some of those levels in now could be attractive over an intermediate term. And which treasure would you say? The longer term, right? We've had a lot of investors, there's been a lot of focus on the short end because there's been so much yield there. We haven't seen for a long time, but I would start moving some of that longer. Start to buy some 7, 8, 9, 10, maybe even longer. Maturity is just to lock in these rates because I do think as we move into a recession inflation comes down that these rates will look attractive over, like I said, an intermediate time period. Thank you so much, Brian Relling, Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Head of Global Fixed Income Strategy. Thanks for joining us. Yeah, thanks for everything. Thank you. You Thanks for joining us. Going green with hydrogen, plug powers on a mission to tackle energy challenges by building green hydrogen plants to produce 500 tons of liquid hydrogen per day. That's by 2025, and we've got the company CEO Andy Marsh with us in the studio today. Good to have you on. Happy Friday. Great to be here, Tico. Yes, and happy Friday. Yeah, I was thinking back to our last conversation. kind of at the height of the concerns around the energy crunch. And you were saying you were getting a lot of calls coming in, especially from Europe about how do we invest in this? How do we expand? But since then, it feels like things have softened a bit. I'm looking at where things have been moving. You've cut hydrogen production forecasts. You've abandoned plans for two plants. What's happening right now? Well, I'm going to kind of correct that with the two plants, Akiko. One of them I announced previously that we were in a position where we couldn't get enough electricity so it didn't make sense. The second cost issue. The second one was we actually never announced we were going to do it, but we announced we weren't going to do it. So maybe a little confusing to some of our investors. But when I look at our sales funnel for hydrogen, it's never been larger. We've had some delays in supply chain, but we have not lost any orders. My sales funnel for electrolyzers, which is the device that generates hydrogen. I think it's probably double since the last time we spoke. So I actually don't see this negative. I know how it's been reported by them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,40,2022-10-31 16:39:42
4442," to generate hydrogen. I think it's probably double since the last time we spoke. So I actually don't see this negative. I know how it's been reported, but I don't think it was captured correctly. I don't think we did a good enough job explaining it. And where do you see this demand coming from? I mean, is this because we saw oil going up so high, and now it's pulling back a bit though, is there, are there differences there when we're looking at oil prices sort of fluctuating? Yeah. So I think long, and you always have to think a little long term here. If you believe people are going to address climate, people like Bloomberg will say 20% of world's energy will come from hydrogen. Important item about hydrogen fuel cells is we create a lot more jobs and batteries, and that makes politicians whether they're fossil fuel politicians, or renewable energy politicians like what we do. The third one, the national security issues that the warn you crane really has highlighted the importance of us in the free world, really dealing with our own energy independence, and all those three are drivers. The broader conversation that's been happening when you think about renewables or green energy versus fossil fuels, sort of in freighting in this context of a trade off, right? You have one or the other. The reality is, yesterday we got that report from the IEA that suggests that investments have been accelerating. And I wonder what you've been seeing from companies that you've been working with. Are corporations creating this calculation with the slowdown that's happening in the broader economy that maybe we need to pull back on some of these investments to accelerate the transition, or are you seeing the opposite? That's an interesting question, a key go. And luckily for many of our applications, we actually help customers save money. So when you think about what we're doing with Amazon and Walmart, you know, Amazon was under a lot of pressure yesterday, but when you bring to the table not only renewable energy, but helps you save money in your present operations by making it more efficient, it's a much easier sales pitch. And during these difficult times, saving money does create value. And look, long term these companies all have goals for 20, 40, 20, 50 to meet their carbon goals and they're doing it because their consumers want it. And what's been the impact from the inflation reduction act? Have the incentives included in their health these companies maybe move in one direction or the other? Absolutely. If you look at the cost of green hydrogen today, it's a lower than diesel fuel. It's a lower than natural gas because of the inflation reduction act. It also positions a U.S. uniquely to be an exporter of green hydrogen, especially to Europe. So it has been a real boom to this industry, but I also think to our long term economy. And you had mentioned during the break that you were creating jobs in New York. So are you able to fill those jobs? I mean, we have heard about companies trying to fill jobs. How is that going? So young people actually like working at companies that have a mission. And it makes it much easier to recruit young town and engineers. And some of us old guys actually like working in the future too. So it's actually one of the things I love about Plug. We have such a wonderful mix of people from 21 to 80 years old who are really helping to drive this transition. Well, that's great to hear. Thanks so much Plug Power, CEO Andy Marsh. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me today. It was always a pleasure. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,41,2022-10-31 16:44:00
4443," you you well I thought it's going to be week for quite a while and I think it's just confirming evidence of that. Retailers have mountains of unsolved inventory from weakness earlier in the year and you know they started all the holiday sales early but history shows it's really difficult to grow the holiday just by starting the sales earlier so they probably pulled some sales forward into early October. Now we've got the election sucking up all the oxygen then we'll come out of it but by and large the reality is it's going to be their promotional holiday season. The consumers clearly weakening when you look at the data with inflation rising so rapidly in the sessies like food and gasoline. A lot of money is going to those kinds of things and people are simply having to spend more to get the same thing so it's going to be a tough holiday season. You see warnings from everyone's like I'm a town. I mean toys have always held up well during holidays but they're saying they don't think so this year. It's going to be pretty tough and has we're already has reported some some wheat numbers there so I think it's going to be a difficult holiday season. Is that a positive consumer story and a deflationary story for the economy? Well if you mean because everything's on sale. That certainly works to some degree to do it but what your thing is just massive numbers of units that are selling at this you know at this very you know diminished price but it's not necessarily what people want. I was heartened I'm an apple shareholder like I think you know I'm going to get a lot of money and I'm going to get a lot of money to get a lot of money to get a lot of money to get a lot of money and I'm going to get a lot of money and I'm going to get a lot of money and I'm going to get a lot of money and I want to get a lot of money to get a lot of money and I want to get a lot of money and I'm going to get a lot of money going to be a lot of money going into some of those sort of social stuff like that and people or other things like, I think almost everyone in the world is one way or the other right? But, uh, heartened buy apples success. You can see people will pay for what they want. The problem is retailers have all these products people do not want. And so, you know, the questions, how muchcha to put them on sale before you sell something nobody wants. And I think we're starting to start, the of the cemetery that has to be but when you look at the data it doesn't appear to be overwhelming this double digit increase in necessities and food. Gasoline, it's down versus where it was earlier in the year but it's still up high double digits versus last year at this time. You have a lot of housing has gone to literally through the roof and terms of prices and obviously interest rates are rising by a lot of things other than holiday gifts. And from a retailer's perspective they're also dealing with the stronger dollar worker shortages from your view from the checks that you've made. Have these situations improved at all specifically the worker shortages? I don't think the worker shortage is improving very much. Supply chain issues have mitigated some wept. And a very subdued outlook for the holiday season at this point. They're very few other than some of the luxury brands. Very few retailers who are saying wow this is really fantastic. You know it's getting the best you're ever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,42,2022-10-31 16:48:44
4444," I they're very few other than some of the luxury brands very few retailers who are saying, wow, this is really fantastic. You know, it's getting the best year ever. You get some good reports out of people like like some of the food companies, you know, some of the some of the CPG companies, but that's exactly what we're saying. You know, they're raising their prices and consumers their necessities or people view them as such and you get good numbers out of out of, you know, out of those sectors. Jerry's picking a bloated inventory. Zididas has a very interesting inventory issue with loads of Yeezy merchandise. Their signature product. What do you expect them to do with it? And what is the comeback story for a brand that's so closely identified some with someone that they had to cut ties with? Is it similar to what Nike would have to do with God forbid they ever had to cut ties with the Jordan brand? I have to say, I don't know what's going to happen to the inventory that's been produced and not sold in the old days, you know, which is totally unacceptable these days. They probably would have dug a hole in the ground and dumped it in there. That's happened more than once in the history of retail to an unsailable product, which is cheaper to dump it than it is to sell it. Maybe let's try to strip the badging of it and sell it on the ultra-discarded channels. You know, there's always somewhere in the world or someone who will buy something. So they'll get rid of it, but it's especially worthless inventory at this juncture. Zididas has been showing for a long time that predates this issue that, you know, Nike has been so clearly number one in the space and done so much better than they have. And this was one bright spot in their in their world. And, you know, they're going to have to take a clean sheet of paper and say, what are we going to do now? Because they had a problem before this and now it's doubled down. Lingerie, if you were the CEO of the Ditas advising him right now, how would you navigate this issue? Because there is backlash clearly that a Ditas had waited so long to cut ties with the Kanye West or was the hashtag boycott a D<|de|><|translate|> Ditas that was trending on Twitter last weekend. Do you think those types of, I guess, issues are going to linger here with the company for quite some time? Not, I really don't. I mean, I think they took the tough action. And it's a little, you know, it's a it's easy for some people to say, hey, we won't do business with them anymore. When it's not a big part of your business, it was a bold step. And I think a strong statement on a Ditas' part. And I commend them for it to take the action that they did. And so I think that'll vanish in terms of the in terms of the concern. But they need to do is find product people want to buy your company within someone who's right. I think that should be able to create a new business advantage on what they've done on and government spending all over the world, not just in the US, but massive government spending that led to the kind of inflation that we're seeing right now. And if we were a different country other than the US and didn't have such a sort of a bedrock currency, if we were grease or something, people would say, you have to cut your spending and balance your budget if you want to get inflation under control, right? Well, we're never going to do that. That's all we do is just keep raising interest rates until eventually the only thing that can happen is that we plunge ourselves into a real old fashion recession. So I'm a little worried about that. I'd have to be honest with you. And I just don't think we're in a good place. So, but... You're not alone. First, must always come. You're not alone in those concerns. Jerry storage, good to see you, sir. Enjoy the weekend. The result is bullying",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,43,2022-10-31 16:53:01
4445," you you them how Good seeing you. And thank you for having us. No, I think that is more business momentum that is cutting across the different geographies that we have and is building as we execute our strategy. And of course, consumers are celebrating and having more cheers everywhere. Yeah, no, there's a lot to celebrate. It's getting out of our houses after two years. But there's a lot of concerns, economic concerns, the economy around the world is slowing, you're a global brand, of course. How does that impact your demand? So beer as a category is very resilient. And if I would say to date what we've been seeing is beer is growing globally, volumes are up. It's gaining share of throat. So this, this growth comes from beer taking from other alcoholic beverages in different markets. And as you know, beer is an affordable item. So when you have economical recession, downtrends, usually consumers maintain consumption in beer or they even up trade because it's very affordable to go from mainstream beer to premium beer. What could be different if you change your car or if you go on international trip? I think that demand is holding. Beer as a category is very resilient. You don't have a lot of penetration on items such as private labels. So even though people sometimes change channels, they don't change the brands that they love. I definitely don't want a private label beer. That just does not my jam. But look, in this environment, you see people trading down and obviously I'm a consumer of your product from a Bud Light platinum, a more premium type of beer to a good old fashioned can of bud, just to save a couple bucks. Not yet, globally we don't see this. Premiumization, as I said, as a trend continues to go and is doing well. You think about our global brands, more premium brands, the squatter, they grew very well, led by Corona that grew revenues 23.5%. Why will you grow revenues 12%? A little bit above that in the quarter. So more premium beers continue to move. It's almost unstoppable trend, they think in the category. A lot of headroom to continue to premiumize. Let's talk about some of the products on this table here. So I've had one of those. I have one of those last night. I have not had one of those in a while. That I've not had. But so this, talk to us about this. What category is this in from your portfolio? How big a brand is that? And even something like cut water as well, on the other side. So in no traditional beer, very well. We have here premium, low carb. You should definitely try Budweiser Zero. It's amazing. You got me with the label. It's one of the go to brands that I have right now because you can take any day in occasion. And there is this traditional categories that we speak about like beer, wine spirits. But this is inside out type of view. Consumers really look at occasions. And what they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,44,2022-10-31 16:57:04

4447," Did. Music Hello everyone and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to our guest U.S. Labor Secretary Martin Walsh. We're here in front of the Labor Department in Washington, D.C. Thank you very much for having a Secretary Walsh. Thanks for having me today on this nice cool day in Washington. It is a bit brisk but you're used to that being from Boston, right? Yeah, not too bad. Yeah, it's a lot colder in Boston today. That's right. So I want to jump right in and ask you about the labor market. Jobs report the other day a little bit weaker than expected in terms of creation but the unemployment rate below 4%. That's good news but I want to ask you what you're most concerned about when it comes to the labor market in the United States right now. Well I think obviously the biggest question we have is getting people back to work in the labor market. I mean lots of jobs to open in the country. So we have some work to do here at the Department of Labor in working with retraining workers in new skills for new opportunities that they left their previous job for they haven't gone back to a job. I think that that's one thing that we have to do a better job of. And that meaning by that when I say a better job is not just the federal government's working with states and cities to create opportunities. You know I'm a former mayor so we did a lot of job training in the city of Boston and I did a lot of work of attracting new companies to Boston because we had workforce there that could do the job. So I think we're in a very different situation right now. This isn't about attracting new companies and filling those jobs. This is about filling jobs that remain open. So 2022 that's going to be we've done in 2021 with 2022 the President has tasked us with that priority of making sure that we get as much job training out there that's going to get real impacting in people back to work. What about black Americans though Secretary Walsh the numbers were a little bit weaker there for that particular group is that a concern for you. Yeah we have to be a lot more intentional when it comes to black Americans historically the unemployment rate for black Americans is often double out of white Americans. But if you dive even deeper in some of the jobs that black Americans have you know high paying jobs. So we have to create better pathways and I think that we have to do you know myself and I've been partnering with Secretary Gdonna from Education and Secretary Mondo from Commerce and working to how do we create better pathways whether it's out of high school into Community College College working businesses working with labor moving forward so we have to do. We have to be more intentional about work there some places have done a really good job of it down down in Atlanta has done some good work on it but there's not enough of those stories around America yet. Another area just to dive in a little bit into the market is restaurants leisure and that sector of the economy which has just been whipsawed obviously by COVID are the steps you can take there well it's a little different I mean we did see some of the largest gains and employment in those areas but there's still a lot of openings in those areas. And I think that the issue of rest what restaurants have it goes a lot deeper than just hiring it goes with the COVID implications with shutting down having to go to take out having a remote having to build barriers in their restaurants so you know again a lot of restaurants have done people have said to me in the beginning of the pandemic when I started this job here at Secretary labor that the unemployment benefit was keeping people from going to work. And quite honestly when the unemployment benefit expires people still didn't go back in some of those industries so again I think those industries are reimagining how do they hire people how do they get more people engaged in coming to work in those places and I do feel that they will come back the pandemic you know we have these conversations all day long about what is going on the economy what's happening. What's happening is we're still living in COVID we still we're still in a pandemic and the pandemic is not gone so there's still fear out there there's still lack of child care out there there's still concern about people going working in with the public so all those challenges we move forward here as we get more people vaccinated and we do a better job of testing I think more people feel comfortable going back to work. Another faster the economy that has caught a lot of people's attention lately is inflation and we just saw that record number come out or 40 year high I should say 7% the other day and I'm wondering how that's impacting the labor market. Well certainly when you think about that number that came out the other day it's not something that I want to talk about we want to see it go the other way and see more people want to work but I think we have to look into the lens of the whole picture and we look at what's happened in 2021 with President Biden after he came back. As an Biden after he took over putting out the vaccines getting getting Americans vaccinated at 81%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,46,2022-10-31 17:05:46
4448," here and we look at what's happened in 2021 with President Biden after he took over, putting out the vaccines getting Americans vaccinated. 81% of the adults are vaccinated out in our country. 6.2 million new jobs, 3.9% unemployment number, 84% of the industries that were affected by the pandemic, people gone back to work. We're seeing lows in highs in job creation and lows in unemployment benefits or the biggest decreases. So those are all positive signs and then we also have to do some more work. We have to make sure we continue to present Biden's economic plan to work on the issues of lowering inflation, bringing forward the experts and the economists saying by the end of the year we'll see that number Saturday the other way, which is a good sign but that doesn't help anyone today. So the president is making sure that the impact he has is going to have a big impact at the kitchen table. You mentioned the vaccines and I want to talk about the vaccine mandate of course and ask you about enforcement obviously still in front of the Supreme Court but where do things stand in terms of the administration forcing that with the companies right now? Well I don't think you have the force of companies. I think most companies have stepped up but it is ultimately it's going to be the responsibility of employers making sure their employees are safe, making sure that the workplace is safe, making sure they're the proper PPE and social distancing if you will inside their establishments. A little trickier when it comes to production lines and things like that where people are working close tight quarters but I think at the end of the day regardless and I'm hopeful the Supreme Court will be able to rule in favor of the Department of Labor. Medical experts have said that this is the right thing to do. People have said this is the right way to go. We should be doing this. Many companies support us but even with or without what the ETS says it's still a good responsibility to work with employers to make sure that workplace are safe for their workers. I mean do you have a plan if the Supreme Court strikes it down? Well I mean the plan is that we're going to be asking employers to continue to make sure that workplace are safe. I mean we're doing that before and I think that I've spent the last couple of weeks here talking to some of the largest employers in the country and we talked about vaccine programs they have. All of these companies are programs set up in them already. So they've already thought about this. They've thought about this from probably mid 2020 through today to make sure they create a safe space for their employees. Number one to keep them safe but also number two to create an environment that people want to come back to work. Secretary Walsh aren't there problems with enforcement given the shortages of test kits and what is the administration doing there to make that happen? Well obviously there's issues around right now it's supply getting more test kits made and the ETS if it's passed or it's in the effect now but if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Department of Labor the testing is going to be for those that are unvaccinated. So that's a lot smaller number than people that are vaccinated. I want to shift gears and ask about some labor and gochiasis and strikes around the country. In March there was a union drive at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama and President Biden called for no intimidation. The federal agency has found that Amazon did legally intimidate workers during the union driver. You disappointed that Amazon defied the president's words? Well there's going to be another vote there. I don't know if the data say it but I saw that the other day there's going to be another vote there in that so there'll be an opportunity for the employees to see if they want to unionize there. Certainly the president's feeling. My feeling is everyone has the right to organize and they should be able to organize without any interference and I think that that's for any company in America. Same with Starbucks there's a lot more unionization going on with those stores. Is that surprised you? Not really. When you look at the numbers, what surprise means the polling number is 70% of millennials feel they look very favorably upon unions and when I say surprise I'm happy to see that. I grew up in a labor family and as a kid not everyone had the same feeling. My family, my father and myself, my uncle and my brother and cousins who felt that way. So it's good to see that there is definitely an interest in unionization again. Unions bring opportunities for people in this country that otherwise wouldn't have the power of collective bargaining and the power of fighting for raising their wages, the power of pensions, the power of other kind of pension plans for one case. So I think that there's opportunities here for us to rebuild the middle class by that and certainly I support collective bargaining and I support unionization but I also support it being done.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,47,2022-10-31 17:10:06
4449, opportunity for us to rebuild the middle class by that. I think it's a very good thing to have a community organization but I also support it being done the right way so if people want to organize they should be able to organize and if people choose not to organize they should have that right as well. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you that's interesting because I'm wondering is labor department where does the labor department stand technically,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,48,2022-10-31 17:14:05
4450," That's interesting because I'm wondering is labor department, where does the labor department stand technically with unionization? I mean, are they pro union or they certainly not anti union, I would imagine, but are they neutral and is it their job to foster unionization in this country? Of course, it's no secret. I'm union guy. I have a union book in my pocket, but I represent all workers in America. So I represent those workers that are covered by collective bargaining and that belong to union and I represent those workers that don't belong to union and I don't represent another one differently than the other one. So it's very important for me to make sure, and we all do that in the department. We have 18,000 employees in the department of labor. Actually, less than that right now, we're hiring up under the past administration. A lot of different departments got hit pretty well, but we represent all workers. Job shortages here. It's a different reason for the job shortage. We didn't fill the spots over the last four years that should have been filled in working protection, safety, M. Shio-Oshan, other places. I saw a post office the other day had a job, employees wanted. I mean, I haven't seen that in a long time at a post office. It used to be a well sought after job. I think it still is. I mean, good benefits and things like that. But again, I think that this pandemic, I don't know how it happened to you, happened to me. We had opportunities to have a lot of downtime thinking about, I was the mayor of Boston when it began. And I went to work every day, but I'd be home at five o'clock that never happens as mayor. And you'd have a lot of time to think about where you are in society, where you are in your job. And I think a lot of people took that time and had a lot of good quality family time, saying, wait a second, I want something different. Let me ask you about Proposition 22 in California, which is a really interesting and critical issue about gig workers and whether or not they're employees. Where do things stand with that? Well, what we're focused on here is on misclassification of employees right now. We're looking at who's being misclassified and the severity of misclassification. When people are misclassified, they lose out on wages, they lose on the benefits, they lose on the protections, they lose out on a whole bunch of different things. And some of those misclassification that we look at, people like dishwasher, everyone thinks of Uber and Lyft as gig working, but some of it's also misclassification of dishwashers in restaurants. So we're working through a process here and we're looking at making sure that workers have their rights, that are owed to them. In October, you visited Striking Kellogg's workers. And I'm wondering how do you make the decision when to visit striking workers or not? Well, I can't visit every strike in place in the country, but generally when I go there, if I go to a strike, it's to support workers, but it's also to create and open to a pathway. I'm willing to step into any negotiation, leaving negotiation that's needed in this country to solve it. If workers are on the street striking, that means that the problem, that's a problem for the company, it's a problem for the workers. The workers make any money and the company is not producing whatever they produce. So I think that when you get to a strike, it's too late. So I think it's important for us to continue the dialogue, stay at the table, even if there's hard feelings, employers and employees should stay at the table and get those negotiations done. In my time as Mayor of Boston, I intervened on several strikes that were successful. In my time as Secretary of Labor, I've intervened on several strikes that have been ended in a good way. So I do feel that we need to keep those conversations dialogues going. The build back better build appears to be dead at this point and Senator Manchin has effectively blocked it. I think it's fair to say there are some labor provisions in that bill. Does that strike you that Senator Manchin is anti-labor, therefore? I wouldn't say it's dead. I would say that it might be, it might be on pause a bit, I hope. No, I would not say Senator Manchin's anti-labor. I've had many conversations with the Senator. You know, certainly he represents the people in the state in West Virginia. The miners in particular, they're unionized that he represents them very tough, very strongly. But I think that there is hopefully dialogue will continue as we get into the new year, a little further into the new year. And there's some great provisions in the build back better build that I'd love to see coming into existence. Pre-Candy-Gaden, child care, adult care. Job training money. All of those are important for our economy moving forward. Also, it looks difficult to get that $15 minimum wage law passed.

4451," Also, it looks difficult to get that $15 minimum wage law passed. I saw that Kroger was paying $25 an hour up in the Midwest, had a job opening there. What are the chances that I had ever had? I can't understand why somebody is against a $15 minimum wage, a baseline minimum wage for families. It just doesn't make any sense to me. People use the excuse, well, it's going to hurt business. It doesn't hurt business. If you look at the states where the minimum wage is $15 an hour, or look at the companies that have raised their minimum wage to $15 sometimes $25, $18. Those companies are raising their wages because they're doing great. They're not raising their wages because they're going out of business. So, in states aren't going out of business and losing business because of that. So, I don't quite understand why we don't have a $15 now, a federal minimum wage right now in our country. The Department of Labor did raise the minimum wage for federal employees this year. I wanted to affect January 1st, and I think we'll see some benefits to that, at least for families. You talked earlier, I think to us, as a matter of fact, about modernizing unemployment insurance in this country. And I'm wondering where things stand with that effort. Is that something you'd still like to pursue? Oh, we're doing it right now. We have the Modernization Office here, the Department of Labor in the UI system. We got a $2 billion investment from the American Rescue Plan. We're working on getting grants out to cities and towns, not cities, out to states across the country, very encouraged by both Democratic and Republican-led states, are very engaged with the Department of Labor in modernizing their system. Speaking of states around the country, I think you visited 30 last year. 60 cities, 30 states. What did you learn? Why do you want to do this, and what did you learn? Well, I learned that the challenges that American workers have are in every state in this country. I found that it's been great going around to the states because I come from Massachusetts, I come from the Northeast, and anyone that knows us, we pretty much stay where we are. But I've had a chance to go all over the country, down to Memphis, and out to California, and to Alabama, in different places. And it's great to talk to people. What I do know, the biggest thing I've seen, and I wouldn't say this is great, but the challenge in struggles people have in America, whether it's around childcare or any good wages, that's a big problem in our country. One thing people have criticized workers for, if you will, is that they are not moving as much as Americans used to. I don't know whether that's the case or not, but I've heard it anecdotally. In other words, people are sort of stuck in towns that may be depressed, and they should move to places where there's more job creation. Do you think that's true or...? That's the first I've heard of it, but I definitely think that we should be making investments in those towns that are depressed and bring more jobs to those areas. And I think that's the responsibility of government to do that, to create more opportunities for people in their cities and towns, so they can build their towns up. Rather than people exit their cities and towns, try and create opportunities in their cities and towns. Secretary, I want to ask some questions about you personally, and growing up in back in Boston, which you talked about. When you were a young child, you had a battle with cancer, and I'm wondering how that informed you in your life, and you're thinking about things. Yeah, when I was seven, I was diagnosed with Burketslum Pharma, which is a former childhood cancer. I tell you what, I got it in 1974, so the prognosis back then was not as good as it is today, thank God, with medicine. But as a child, it didn't inform me, but as I got older, I realized that what my family went through and what I went through made me think a little differently about how I govern, how I lead, and really thinking about making sure opportunities. So, for example, in Massachusetts, I was proud to vote for universal health insurance in Massachusetts. We did it before Obamacare, and it was a good vote because I knew that there were thousands of families in Massachusetts like the same place my family was in 1974 that didn't have a lot of money and resources, but creating opportunities for families today to have health care. You followed your father into the union, and I'm wondering what you talked about, and I'm wondering, what did you take away from that, what did you get out of that, and what drew you to that, actually, besides just your dad? Well, first and foremost, I shouldn't have dropped out of college to go on the A, and my father was dead against it, but I did drop out. And what I learned was the ability for hard work and what it means, and understanding that, you know, I'm fortunate in my life, the opportunities I've had in my life, and my father went to work every day, and millions of people like my...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,50,2022-10-31 17:23:06
4452," what it means and understanding that, you know, I'm fortunate in my life, the opportunities I've had in my life and my father went to work every day and and millions of people like my father went to work every day and got dirty and came home. It was able to support a family, raise a family, put food on the table. My father was able to live with dignity when he retired because he had a pension. My father was able to die with dignity because he knew that his pension would be able to go to my mother when he died. So that that union gave my family the opportunity from the time he came off the plane in Ireland when he joined the union to the day that he passed away and my mother still has that same pension my father had. What's the biggest difference between being the mayor Boston and the US labor secretary? Oh, when you the mayor of the boss, you know, President Biden's my boss and I'm gonna present Biden's my boss. I work with the guys over there in ladies over there, I should say. No, it's a little different. It's an executive role being mayor and it's executive slash policy role being Secretary of Labor and obviously that the the geographic reach of the Secretary of Labor's job, it's you know, 50 states and also territories in our country and also we also have international labor office here at the Department of Labor.

That's lower on the day by about 1%. And you're taking a look at the past three months, but let's also just take a look as we round out this month as the month to date comes to a conclusion here. Over the month of October, you're seeing that the Nasdaq composite is held on to gains of about 3.8% in what's been a good month and aggregate here. And so ultimately, you will see how things end out on the month and then the S&P 500. You're seeing that's also net positive over the past 21 days that this is playing in. I don't know why we're not getting the full scope. But anyway, we are down on the day by about eight tens of percent here. Briefly taking a look at some of the sector activity as well. You've got more laggards. Actually, all of the S&P 500 sectors were in negative territory earlier. We do have two that have trickled into positive territory. And surprise, surprise, energy is one of them. It's up by about 9.10% of a percent. Flat just barely to the upside right now. You've got materials. That's up flat, but to the upside by about 1.10% of a percent. With that, it's all things on over to you. Interesting. The energy is continuing that huge run inside this year and for the month of October. Let's zoom out now for a global look at the economy. Investors have turned cautious after the disappointing release of China's manufacturing and non-many manufacturing PMI, both unexpectedly contracted in October, pointing to more economic headwinds ahead. This, as China continues to grapple with COVID-19 lockdowns. We mentioned earlier today that Disney Shanghai also shut its doors to comply with COVID-19 prevention measures. Our next guest, warns of China's economy, will not profess enough to compensate for the boost in export demand it saw from state home orders during COVID. Joining us now with our insight is Waley BlackRock Global Chief Investment Stragist. Thank you so much for being here. Appreciate it. So, as we look at the China situation, we are still seeing lockdowns there, renewed wave of lockdown seemingly. At the same time, the economy is sort of struggling to break out. So, first of all, I guess, when do you see the lockdowns may be starting to end? And secondly, even when they do, what happens with the economy there? I think it's really important to recognize that there are some structural headwinds to growth right now in the case of China. So, yes, of course, the zero-covid policy has weighed down on growth expectations so far this year. But it's not just zero-covid policies, also export drivers that have been such a big contributor to China growth during the COVID pandemic period that is now fading away as the rest of the world switches back on. So, as the export drivers kind of fade, actually, that represents a structural kind of headwinds to China growth, which is why we're forecasting just slightly above 3% for this year. And higher than that, of course, next year as China reopens, but not very high. So, we're not going to see a reshaped rebound in the case of China. Should investors just avoid investing in China at all right now? I think the tactical and the strategic case for investing in China right now is challenged because of this also focus from not just growth to broader issues like national security, all of that representing a bit of a headwind for structural growth, but also in terms of how that a headwind growth can translate into corporate profitability, which is why earlier on in the year, we downgraded China from overweight to neutral. And actually, currently, strategically, there is an underweight allocation to China government bonds because the yield pickup attractiveness versus US government bonds has been eroded away as we now get paid by holding US government bonds. Are we just not going to see any of the tit for tat tariffs that we had seen during the US-China trade war over the past couple of years and even going into 2020, waiting for some type of resolution.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,53,2022-10-31 17:36:05
4455," TITFURTAT tariffs that we had seen during the U.S.-China trade war over the past couple of years and even going into 2020 waiting for some type of resolution on where that would move forward. Or we're just not going to have those conversations reemerge and actually for it to get worse before there's any inkling that it may get better. I think it's very optimistic to hope for a resolution around the trade war and TITFURTATK between U.S.-China. In fact, if anything we have seen acceleration of some of that geopolitical tension, so thinking about the focus on cheap manufacturing, thinking about the broader kind of decoupling and moving further apart of the spheres of influence between U.S.-China. So I think that is going to be the base case underpinning our structural kind of expectation on the geopolitical front and for investors thinking about investing in China from a global portfolio perspective. We need to think about what that means from a risk premium perspective when we construct portfolios. Let's talk about portfolio construction with regard to the U.S. as well. As you mentioned a moment ago, we're now finally getting paid to hold U.S. funds, which is an experience we haven't had in a while. In fact, the U.S. Treasury website has been crashing on occasion as retail investors try to get on there. At the same time, obviously there is a puzzle here for the Federal Reserve as it is raising rates. What is your rate outlook here in the U.S.? What are you expecting here from the Fed on Wednesday? Well, I think the 75 bits of rate hikes is a foregone conclusion that will happen. But what really matters is how far rate hikes can go and also for how long that will stay and also what that means for growth. Earlier in the segment, we talked about the October rally. We believe that the October rally in risk assets is really on shaky grounds because markets previously were looking for a dovish pivot from the Fed. Then they were looking for a pause from the Fed. Now markets are getting excited about just the pace of rate hikes decreasing, which of course it will because you cannot keep hiking as the 75 bits permitting. So if you select markets wants to see some positive development in terms of dovish message from the Fed, but really we're not at that juncture yet because if you look at core inflation, it's still very, very sticky from last week's core PCE, for example, still really quite persistent. And at the same time, the focus of the Fed is really solely on the politics of inflation, with inflation where things are. The mandate is to fight inflation at all cost this year. So we believe that rates will continue rising. It will peak at 5% and not to understated. That's a very, very restrictive territory. Where we are now at 3.25% is already restrictive to the economy. So our belief is that in this current supply constraint environment, the Fed is going to have to engineer a recession in order to bring down inflation. Our assessment is that if they were to want to bring down inflation to 2%, reasonably quickly, it represents a 2% shock to the US economy in 2023. It also represents a 3 million additional people out of a drop pushing unemployment rate to 5%. So this is the sort of the very heavy and high cost of inflation fighting in a current environment shaped by supply. And that's what we're looking for from the Fed. The acknowledgement of the tougher trade off from this environment. The market's on shaky ground, like you mentioned, just given the potential for more negative news until your end. Do you think the gains we've seen in October get unwound? It's possible. It's possible because a lot of the bad news really kind of starting to come together and they have yet to be reflected in market pricing. So I talked about the Fed and the economy, but we haven't talked about earnings season because the shocking kind of downside surprise of the big tech names last week. Yes, earnings forecast are coming down, but not down enough. Next year, as in P500, we're still talking about meat to high single digit growth for US earnings in 2023. That is really not aligned with our expectation for a recession next year. So earnings needs to come down. It's not yet in the price. And I think markets will wake up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,54,2022-10-31 17:40:22
4456," signed with our expectation for a recession next year. So earnings needs to come down. It's not yet in the price. And I think markets will wake up to that before finding a foundation to the radio. For investors that are still willing to have some type of risk component in their portfolio, they might look at speculative assets that are highly deteriorated from some of their peak values. And I think about crypto. BlockRock has its own kind of blockchain-based ETF as well. I believe you've launched two of them over the course of this year. But I guess more broadly speaking, is this still a time to be kind of looking at crypto, even though the valuations are highly depressed from where we began, even at the kind of early points of the year here? Well, with regards to crypto, there is a demand. That's why we issue the products to address that demand. But assumptions on return and risk needs to be really positive for crypto to justify even a small, very, very small allocation in a hope of all your contacts. So to your point about where to deploy risk. Currently, we are underweight development market equities, but we're just modestly underweight. We're overweight investment-grade credit. In this environment, we believe that investment-grade credit offers you income and also are pricing in a version of growth slowdown that we're forecasting. And so this is where we want to deploy risk budget at this point. Really great conversation. Waley, BlackRock global chief investments strategist, thanks for coming to studio. We appreciate it.

Unilever is looking to counteract foreign costs with price hikes, saying it raised its prices by a record 12 1,5% in third quarter. Move caused the consumer goods company lift its full-your-sales growth guidance to over 8% in 2022. Unilever CEO Alan Jope joins us now. Alan, good to have you on the program here. We talked a lot to a lot of different consumer products companies in recent weeks and trying to get a sense of the consumer's trading down, giving the inflation the Rc. What are you seeing in your business? Alan, I think you're muted. Apologies, Brian. Thanks. We had another good quarter of growth. We've raised our guidance, as you said. It's coming in line with our strategic priorities. In particular, our big brands are doing very well. Unilever has 12 billion euro brands and those brands grew 14% in the quarter. To directly answer your question, our portfolio is made up about 35% of our businesses in premium segments, 50% in the middle of the market, and 15% in what we would consider value offerings. But slightly counterintuitively in times of inflation, we are not seeing trading down. The premium end of our portfolio is growing at least as fast as the value segment. I think that may be a moment in time. We've invested a lot in our brands and quality and in marketing support. And I don't think we're anywhere near the end of the inflation period. So we are preparing for potential future downtrading, but we're not seeing it right now, Brian. So for the customers, as of right now, are you looking at where prices are having to be passed through to them and where they're continuing to take those prices versus where they're pushing back on those prices and which product categories are you seeing that most? So the first thing to say is that we're extremely sensitive to the situation that the ordinary household is finding itself in around the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,56,2022-10-31 17:49:08
4458," The first thing to say is that we're extremely sensitive to the situation that the ordinary household is finding itself in around the world. And price increases are our last resort, not our first resort. We are doing everything we can to take waste and cost out of our own business. We are very far from having passed along all of the inflationary costs that we have felt to the consumer. And a particularly important thing to look at is there are most of the markets of the world outside the US are experiencing simultaneously commodity inflation and currency devaluation. And in those markets, we are seeing mid to high teens price increases, places like Latin America, Southeast Asia, Turkey. In countries with harder currencies like the US, of course, it's just the commodity inflation that is being passed through and even then not at 100%. As far as our retail customers are concerned, we're working in partnership with them so far. It's been very collaborative. And we all have the same thing which is to try and provide great value to the consumer. Remember, value is not just price, it's a function of quality and price. Alan, it's Julie here. I have some question about Unilever's structure, if you will. We know that Nelson Peltz is now on the board of the company. We know that you are leaving at the end of next year. What does Unilever look like five years from now, three years from now, as a result of the big change in leadership, as well as perhaps changes that he's pushing for? Yeah, I would like to just confirm that Nelson is turning out to be a great member of the board. I'm thoroughly enjoying working with him and as far as he tells me he's enjoying working with me. We recently made a radical before Nelson joined the board, actually, we made a significant change to our structure. We moved from a rather complex matrix organization that we've had for about a couple of decades, actually. And we moved to five divisions, each somewhere between eight and 12 billion euros of revenue. Interestingly, after all the work we've done in our portfolio, shedding slower growth businesses, like spreads or tea and acquiring into higher growth spaces, like luxury beauty or health and well-being, each one of those five business groups has the potential to grow ahead of Unilever's overall growth over the last five years. So we've done our tinkering with the organization, we've got five very focused business units, and Nelson is very supportive of that direction on org change. And Alan, Unilever perhaps more than any other company of its size has pushed a lot into some of your units becoming B corporations. And I wonder if you've gotten any pushback, either from PELTS or other investors, if there's any plans to sort of pull back on those kinds of efforts, there's been sort of a larger public backlash against some of those types of efforts, not specific to Unilever as well. What's your current thinking on it? You know, we are not an NGO, we're a for profit organization, and the reason why we care so much about sustainable business, B Corps and other expressions of it is because we think it contributes to the bottom line. We're seeing our brands that offer consumers a sustainable choice are growing much faster, we've taken 1.2 billion euros of cost out to the business through sustainable sourcing, we know it reduces risk, a world on fire under watchers, not a great place to be selling soap or soup. And that's a magnet for talent, our employer brand is in tremendous shape because of our commitment sustainability. We hear overwhelmingly from shareholders and board members, all of our board members to stay the course. BlackRock work with us on our carbon commitments, other investors work with us on our nutrition profiles, other investors are interested in our commitment to pay a fair living wage in our value chain. We're all actions taken to make Unilever strong business into the future and improve the bottom line. They're not in any way an alternative to strong financial performance. Now on, is Nelson running the playbook he did?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,57,2022-10-31 17:53:23
4459," into the future and improve the bottom line. They're not in any way an alternative to strong financial performance. Alan is Nelson running the playbook he did when he shook up PNG. And by that I mean, is it more of an internal changes on how things operate or is a different situation at UniLiever where you might see acid cells within the next six to 12 months? We've been busy on portfolio changes, I already mentioned. We've committed to the market that we are not undertaking a major portfolio change for the next, for the foreseeable future. And our board is unanimously aligned behind the strategy that we've laid out in our last couple of earnings quarters and we will lay out again in our capital markets day. So please don't be expecting any surprises from UniLiever. We've got five wonderful divisions, a business that's capable of delivering high quality growth and that as you'll see from our performance and our share of prices rather resilient through the types of downturn that the world is going into right now. It sounds like Alan, you are enjoying working with Nelson. I do think you'll stay on longer than you expect. And look, I made a deal with myself and my family when I came into this job to do it for up to five years. I'm already four years in the end and next year is five years. We've accomplished a lot of the things that we wanted to accomplish. I am enjoying working with the board and with Nelson's a member of that board, but we've made our decision on a leadership of this company. And I'm sure the board will do a great job finding a wonderful successor. You know, we often ask executive such as yourself, whether you're activating an economic downturn playbook or a recessionary playbook, but from what you're seeing in the data and the sales that comes through and across some of the core segments that you operate, are your consumers operating their own recessionary playbook? That is a great question. You know, not one of us in this show or in Unilever's business has lived through an operated a business through a period of significant global inflation. But we have plenty of markets around the world that have operated through periods of inflation. So if you ask Unilever's managers in Argentina, or Brazil, or Turkey, or part of Southeast Asia, we certainly have a playbook on what to do in inflationary times. And we are following it. I think one unusual characteristic of this downturn is it's accompanied by high levels of employment. And things have to get pretty grim in a household before they start to materially cut back on the type of brands that we sell. So so far so good, we are not complacent and we're certainly drawing on our playbook from those other markets around the world. Alan, finally, we wanted to ask you just quickly about the dry shampoo recall that the company just issued affecting a number of different brands for potential presence of benzene. It seems as though benzene has been creeping its way into various kinds of consumer products and causing these kinds of recalls. How does that kind of thing happen? And then what do you do to address it? Yeah. We have an enviable track record for the quality and safety of our brands. It is true that we discovered very, very extreme low levels of benzene in the propellant of a number of dry shampoos, our safety experts and independent experts have assessed that there is no safety risk to consumers. But out of an abundance of caution, we put safety ahead of any other value in the business. And so we are recalling a small number of these products. And we have the highest protocols for safety. But every now and again, something creeps through the net. And we will be measured by our response. And at the moment, our response is the most cautious one we could possibly muster. Is there a financial write down that you expect as a result of the recalls? No, the financial impact is trivial. All right. We're going to be doing a CEO, Alan Job joining us here today. We appreciate the time, Alan. Thank you very much. Absolutely. Guys, coming up, the countdown. To midterm elections is on, Kevin's really going to join us to break down what to expect next.

4461," 45% in Pennsylvania, Dems Up 6, Federman leading Oz, 49% to 44%, those polls are tightening. In Georgia, Dems Up 3, Raphael Warnock, leading Herschel Walker. We all know the scandals that have been plaguing the Walker campaign, 49% to 46%. But in Nevada, a complete political deadlock, incumbent Senator Catherine Cortez-Masdo, neck and neck with her Republican challenger, Adam Laxal at 47% of peace. So again, the Senate, I control the Senate right now, hanging on Vice President Kamala Harris, having that key tie breaker vote. But it's really anybody's guess how this comes down in just a week from tomorrow. But I do want to know, this is important, and part of a larger historical trends here in the United States. More than 20 million Americans have already cast their ballot as a result of pre-election voting. 46 states are already accepting votes. So again, early access voting, voting before pre- ballots, all of that is having an effect here as well. Yeah, definitely. And then there's also, of course, the sort of stories on the periphery that have been affecting the discourse around the election, right? And that has to do with what happened with Paul Pelosi, security, an issue following the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband. What is the latest that we know there? Because there's also been, as we know, some misinformation out there. Some new developments in terms of where this security case is now leading. We're expecting for an arrangement to happen sometime earlier this, or sometime early this week in San Francisco. Her accuser Paul DePave is set to be arranged later this week on multiple charges, truly, including a tentative homicide. Over the weekend, on the Sunday shows, Senator Amy Klobuchar speaking to NBC News as meat the press, in which she called for additional security for elected officials and their families. Now, this is something that quite frankly has been discussed on behalf of both parties in recent years as political violence in America has increased. And there could be eventually a tiered system. So Klobuchar suggesting that if you're not in line to succession of the president of the United States, that perhaps your family would be able to work with local security officials or local municipality officials. But it has reopened this broader discussion about security for elected officials, one that we saw percolate during after the January 6th attack. And it has raised questions about discourse in American politics. Now, Kevin McCarthy, one of the top Republicans in the House of Representatives, he spoke out on the Sunday shows and said that it's not fair to label all Republicans who are looking to replace Speaker Pelosi until control back to Republicans. As those who have or are a part of the attacks, but he also has suggested that perhaps increase political rhetoric ought to cool down a bit as we come to the final spread of the midterm elections. Okay, have you also watching the Fed meeting? Yes, what's going to, oh yeah, the Fed, right? Oh yeah. What's going to happen this week, this Wednesday, when the Fed meets, and especially in terms of the December rate hike. Look, record high inflation, wage growth, not necessarily where it should be. And economists talking about a recession, if we're not already in one for some time for next year. When you juxtapose that from my neck of the woods here in Washington, DC with what policymakers are going to be forecasting after the midterms in a lame duck session, for example, it's going to be anybody's guess to see what just the path that lawmakers in both parties take to try to get out of what feels at this point like an inevitable recession. Well, Kevin, pop culture and sports culture are using a different recession indicator. That is the Philadelphia Phillies here. What are you up to? I have heard about this. I don't know how I feel about this, but I think that it's good news. I also want to say that I'm wearing my Eagles green because we are still, still undefeated. Fly Eagles fly all the way. Kevin, so really, we appreciate the update here. We're going to check back in throughout the World Series as well. You bet it. Guys, coming up, we're going to break down some of the big calls of the day on the other side, including a double downgrade to Haynes brands. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,60,2022-10-31 18:06:20
4462," Let's talk about some other movies right now. These prompted by calls from analyst Haynes Brands in particular, Getson Attention. The stock got double downgraded from Wells Fargo. It's pretty rare to see a double downgrade. The analysts are sending concerns over the company's debt position and you saw the effect it is having on the stock with it trading lower by nearly 5% today. So basically, underweight from an overweight, that's how we call it a double downgrade. And that the macro outlook could prove problematic for the company as well. That's what the analyst is saying. And that maybe management can't do anything about it if indeed things are going badly in the broader economy. Sometimes analysis could be very simple. And I would say this falls under the radar here of Haynes Brands. Now, what's the Haynes Brands website? They're selling a 10 pack of boxers for $29. I mean, that to me is very, very sharp pricing. And it comes alongside a quarter where they just exited a couple of months ago where they exited with too much inventory in the channel. And it's not just boxer briefs and tidy wideies. It's also champion. Champion has been a big growth driver for Haynes Brands for some time. That sales for that brand has now started to fall off a cliff, also leading to more inventory issues. Not surprised by this. It's really shocked when Haynes Brands reports very shortly here that they might warn again. And it is challenging to push forward a company like Champion to operate more of the brick and mortar retail experiences at a time where the consumer is being perhaps as Wells Fargo was calling it more cynically here, reacting more cynically within where they are purchasing and where the discretionary dollars are being put to use. So that all leading to Wells Fargo to slash their estimate, 30% below consensus 2023 earnings per share. And a little surprise that you wouldn't think that something like a Haynes Brands would get a benefit from a trade down effect. But I guess if people are making a decision to buy less overall, maybe the underwear replacement cycle, I don't know. I wish we were. You want to go there? No, I mean, you know, like how often do normal people typically rebuy these types of items? You should be buying underwear on a regular basis. You can't keep using the same style stuff. Of course. But I guess what I'm saying is I wonder what that typical cycle is and then does it get lengthened in times of economic hardship? We're just continuing to what? I need to read a white paper about this. She's right. I just go to Paramount. We're going to talk about Paramount because the buying bottom for socks means you're wearing more holy socks out there. Guys, also let's talk about Paramount here. You're taking a look at shares. They're down 5% right now after Wells Fargo downgraded the media giant from equal weight to underweight, saying, quote, cutting concerns have worsened. Yeah, they have. So actually kind of showing up in some of the results that we had seen start to come through last weekend and really on the telecom providers, those that offer internet services where they're seeing subscribers or the combination of internet services and cable subscriptions. We saw this in Comcast. If you're seeing more people actually cutting the cord, what does that also mean for some of the core companies that have relied on either their content being going or going into or being licensed out? And Paramount is one of those major companies that would rely on a number of people keeping their cords at least for the time being while also mounting their own type of subscription plays in their future too on the streaming front. Yeah, Paramount stock had a pretty good September. And I'm not surprised. I think back to CEO Bob Bakish talking to our very own alley canal at the all market summit to struck a bullish tone on their business moving forward. But Stephen K. Hall is the analyst that wrote this note over at Wells Fargo, probably one of the best media analysts in the green game. In addition to what you mentioned, Brad, he also notes, we see opportunities for Paramount to unlock value, but don't think they're currently under consideration. Now I would imagine that be more asset sales. Paramount has moved quickly under this new management team to sell off very assets. I believe they're a book publishing business. They sold off a year and a half ago or so. Net doesn't look to be under consideration. And Stephen doesn't like it. Yeah. And if the company doesn't do those things that he suggests, he says the valuation should be closer to its peers like Warner Brothers Discovery or Fox. All right. From streaming to dirt and finally shares a caterpillar in focus after you've asked down gray the stock to neutral from buy but maintaining an upbeat outlook on the equipment maker long term and surprise surprise. This comes against the backdrop of more lockdowns in China, which of course is a key market for caterpillar. I'm saying that the thesis on positive margin inflection is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,61,2022-10-31 18:13:27
4463," and surprise surprise this comes against the backdrop of more lockdowns in China which of course is a key market for caterpillar. Yeah they were saying that the thesis on positive margin inflection is playing out and particularly there some of the part the positive trajectory for margins and earnings growth from here is reflected within this downgrade and so within that they're expecting sales and margins to grow through 2024 4% of head of some of the consensus EPS for that year too. Yeah this is after the quarter they had that was a pretty darn pretty good quarter but you know we'll see what ends up happening going forward now. All right coming up next process gonna join us to bring down his takeaways from this year's watch time event in New York City we need a little break from the doom and gloom down. Yes, 왼 saturation indicator. As we said earlier, it's not timing the market. It's time in the market. And how will you tell time if not with a beautiful watch? That was a bad side guy. Sorry. Hi, and watchmaker showed up new luxury timepieces during this year's Watch Time event in New York City. This is the all-important Christmas season approaches. The market they're aiming at might surprise you. Joining us for takeaways from the event is Yahoo! Funded as Prosperania. Pros, it's interesting, like it feels a little weird to be talking about luxury watches right now when we're talking about economic seldom, but there's obviously still a market. Yeah, big time market, especially in certain pockets of the world, you know. We went to this event. This is the biggest watch event these coasts back in full-forcer after the pandemic. It's brought to you a bunch of large brands, even some small and up-becoming brands, but what's going on in the industry? One big trend we saw, their laser focus on the resilient and growing US market, Ron Stahl of Carlisth Beaker, told us about that. The US is on fire again. You know, the US came out of COVID and watches are back at an all-time-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,62,2022-10-31 18:18:00
4464," told us about that. The U.S. is on fire again. You know, the U.S. came out of COVID and watches are back at an all-time high. The excitement, the enthusiasm, I mean America's really driving the watch market from all angles. You might remember Carl F. Beaker, they were in the John Wick film, so I said, watch as he wore amongst all the bad guys. Anyway, the strength in the U.S. were traditional markets like Asia slowed down a bit because of the pandemic. Another effect of the pandemic, supply chain issues, even in the specialized watch industry. Jules English shoes, the Coffinor Brehmont, a big British watch brand, told us about that recently and how hard it is to meet demand. Any supply chain out there, if I wanted to get a seal for a watch, it used to be six months now, it's 18 months, so that's why even more important that we manufacture more. Global currency is a challenge, the strength of the dollar, so if you're buying anything in dollars or anything in Swiss franc, which mirrors the dollar, that's definitely a challenge. But you have a natural hedge by selling in U.S. dollars, so that's important for us. So, Brehmont, they had their new Supernova watch there, which is an in-house movement, which is a big deal for a small watch brand to develop the R&D to make that kind of bespoke in our movement for a watch that might sell only in the thousands. I mean, these watches look good. And clearly, there is some resilient demand from the higher income, or more affluent consumers out there. What is really driving some of the demand right now, from what they were telling you? You know, it seems like a lot of it is kind of like a bunch of factors. You know, you have new collectors coming in, you have people kind of driving, that kind of sat out, the pandemic, didn't spend any money on travel and things like that, so they kind of got interesting watches, they show the hype watch effect on Instagram, kind of having those must-have watches, what people kind of are sort of lusting after. And it's, you know, it's jewelry, it's driven by men, but also young people, also women, it's a lot of women at the show compared to last year, so a lot of clubbers out there. So, we spoke to the CEO of CoSIE of Oritz, which is like a kind of a story twist brand that's been around for a long time. They're private, they're owned by Swatch, they're private now. Having a big moment now, it's a newly cool kind of watch. So, here's what Ralph Stewart had to say. He's the CoSIEO. Well, all indicators basically are red, right? Inflation, the economy is slowing down a little bit, but we don't see no stop at all. And I think it's related to the pandemic. People had a lot of time to learn about mechanical watches, and it has become much more important topic in their lives, and they are ready to spend, still spend money on mechanical watches, spend more money on mechanical watches, because they know more, so, no, at the moment, we really don't see any downturn as we did in other difficult times before. So, no downturns yet. I did try on one of their watches with the Sam and Dial Pro Pilot X titanium watch, beautiful watch, also an in-house movement, so that's a big deal for a brand-length horse. What do you call watches on TikTok? Like, is TikTok like what is there a watch? Do you know what I mean? Is there a watch like kind of said? No. Maybe that's it. I don't know. I think I'm watching this. I'm thinking, remember when the Apple Watch came out, and everybody thought the Apple Watch would kill the watch industry, but I see this. I see a lot of innovation. As a watch guy, and this is next level stuff here. Yeah, you know, it's funny. I thought the same thing, right? And I think there was a little effect with the Apple Watch. A lot of people bought into it. What's the point having got an old watch? But I guess it's the same kind of feeling you get with an older classic car, for instance. You kind of like the fact that it's a very simple thing, a mechanical thing, it works on it, so you can work on it too. So I think there's a little bit of a, I'm going to peel our fascination with these older, you know, timepieces that can actually last hundreds of years if you care for them. It was a great analogy, especially for the classic car guru here. That both of you are. Probably thanks so much for taking the time. Excellent work. Taking the time. Yeah. Oh, man. The huns just taking the time. Take a look. All right, guys, we're running out of time here for this segment. We're coming up. Taylor Swift, yeah, T-Swinsley sets a record with her new album, and New York City goes full pay transparency. We've got all the drama, the Deeds, next in Cut for Time and Full Review of the first six songs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,63,2022-10-31 18:22:04
4465," It's next in Cut for Time and Full Review of the first six songs. Welcome back, Time for Cut for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this on the day. Ford is looking to shake some slack out of its workforce. According to an internal email obtained by the Wall Street Journal, the company told managers that certain staffers could take severance rather than enroll in the company's performance enhancement plan. Some of the early inclinations of that plan were laid out in this most recent earnings report and conference call that took place thereafter as well when they had talked about some of the restructuring that was coming forth as well. Yeah, I can't say this is really surprising. I think this is a company very much in transition, splitting up internally how it does certain things, trying to, it's splitting its business between a gas power operation and an electric operation and this is to be expected. They're going to have to move a lot faster and it's not just Ford, it's GM if they want to compete even more effectively with Tesla. I mean, I think in this new era, right, we got used to a very robust job market for a long time. And now that things are slowing down, we're going to get different companies coming up with different creative ways to shrink their workforces, whether it's offering severance to some workers or other methods. We're just unfortunately going to have to get more use to these kinds of stories. I think in our conversations with Ford too, we've consistently asked the CFO John Lauer about where some of those changes might need to be made with regard to that new structure. Absolutely. All right, New York City will require companies with at least four employees to post salary ranges in job listings starting Tuesday. This is as, this is part of its effort to increase pay transparency. There's no fine for a first time offense, but companies found to violate the law could face civil penalties of up to $250,000 if not corrected within 30 days. Good. Good to see it. Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of implications of this law, not least of which is that more data presumably will then be available to figure out what what what pay is for",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,64,2022-10-31 18:26:31
4466," to see it. Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of implications of this law, not least of which is that more data presumably will then be available to figure out what what what pay is for various industries. There's been like sort of people led efforts on this or you can go on certain websites and see, but this is really a good step forward in figuring that out. And it's significant too in understanding better where those salaries that are still being advertised or discussed. And number one, bringing it up to to parody across certain roles where there has been so much of a discrepancy or a disparate amount of payment and compensation that's going forward. And some of that is going to help employees be able to negotiate better in all positions. Right, gender, people of color, not necessarily gotten the same, you know, this way companies have to be very upfront about those kinds of things. Totally support this move. New York City. All right, and Taylor Swift is now the only artist to sell at least a million copies in a single week for five different albums, her latest album Midnight. So one and a half million copies across formats, notching the third largest streaming week ever for an album and the biggest sales week since Adele's 25, seven years ago, we got the Brad Smith, we were privy to the to the Brad Smith quick review this morning. It was not terribly enthusiastic. Not take away. This will not be the first Taylor Swift concert that I decide to go to based on this album. And here's why anti hero sure getting a lot of conversation, ultimately I could remake the instrumentals probably in Garage Band. The vocals for track one solid drop futuristic form the floor vibes, vocal sound like it was recorded in the bathroom, though, and several of the other tracks sound the same way on the vocals front. I'm upset at the engineering it a little bit, but again, this is not the one that I'm going to say. I mean, I can really add to that is this music all sound said now I want to be said. I've always been T Swift agnostic and this album does not change that opinion. I'm just I'm mostly just not a pop girl. So this was never going to be an album for me. Yeah, get the tissues in the candy ready. Is that going to need you? You got to get that Reese's after the show. All right, folks, that does it for us today coming up in S. Great's going to continue our conversation around Twitter with light set, light shed partners, rich green field. He is always an interesting guy to listen to.

4467," Ian Welcome to Yahoo Finance. It's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm in S for a in for Akiko Fujita here. What I'm watching today. Tweeting up a storm. It's Elon Musk's first full week in charge of Twitter and there are already reports of layoffs and changes to the blue check mark verification system will discuss what may lie ahead. Also COVID chaos Shanghai Disney abruptly closing over COVID concerns with visitors unable to leave until they test negative for the virus will bring you the latest and black Adam is a hit that duane the rock Johnson action flick scoring a second week at the top of the box office will break down the weekend box office coming up. But first let's take a look at the market action right now we are watching all major averages lower you're looking at the Dow right now that's down more than a hundred points the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also lower we're looking at also energy today and we're watching WTI and crude oil a Brent crude oil that is that is lower as well. Well to recap the month that I was in the markets and to preview what to watch this week let's bring in Yahoo finances Alexander Seminova and Jared Blyckery Alex let's start with you so we're watching the Fed of course this week. Yeah and as well the Fed's next policy move and October's jobs report on Friday are going to headline a busy start to November trading this week and both the events are going to determine whether the momentum that we have seen in October will hold up for the rest of the year now investors are expecting another 75 basis point rate hike on Wednesday. There's very little room for surprise when it comes to the actual policy decision but they'll tune into what Jerome Powell has to say afterwards and where FOMC members stand with their economic projections. We've been seeing some signs in data that the economy is showing signs of slowing down with the jobs report out this week we're expecting payroll gains to fall below that key 200,000 number. We've also heard a change in tune from some Fed members that have kind of renewed optimism among investors that the Fed may scale back on hikes in December and pivot sooner than expected but much of Wall Street is actually saying not just yet analysts at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are actually saying that investors should not be eating up any hawkish whispers out of the Fed that even if officials begin those discussions J Powell is still likely to come out and assert that the Fed's priority is to rein an inflation and to proceed with aggressive tightening. This moment feels kind of like July and August we saw investors hoping for a pivot and then we saw big slump in September when J Powell came out at Jackson Hone said that that wouldn't happen. And Jared a lot will ride of course on what J Powell says this week but October was among that some were expecting a crash not so. Yes we just had the best October in the Dow in its history that goes back to data in 1896 so that's quite a few years however you go to the Nasdaq and it's the opposite story it's only the best October since last year so let me show you how this is breaking down. Here is the Dow. It's up 14% over these 21 trading days right here you can see that on your screen and now I want to post the returns for the Nasdaq down about 1% today it's up only about 3% I think investors will still take those gains but it just shows you how this has kind of been a bifurcated market and if I step inside the market you can really see a difference between the high flyers and the losers here this is what's going on today let me just change this to a one month view energy up 26% followed by industrials 14 financials 12 materials 9.8% healthcare staples also right there with it these are some big gains for what are traditionally the more value sectors of the market everything's in the green but communication services",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,66,2022-10-31 18:35:01
4468," and healthcare staples also right there with it. These are some big gains for what are traditionally the more value sectors of the market. Everything's in the green, but communication services, that's what houses meta, guess what? That is taking up the rear. That is still up about half a percent. Now you take a look inside the NASDAQ and you can see some outsize winners and also outsize losers. Apple up over 10%, Amazon down per 10%, Tesla down 15, meta down 30%. But you put all this together and I think a lot of it is going to hinge on what happens with the currency situation in us. And speaking of the currency situation, what's happening with the Brazilian rail? Because we had the elections in Brazil, Lula de Silva, who was president from 2003 to 2010, has won that election. So now he will be doing a third term. He had served two consecutive terms before. He's seen as a leftist but more moderate. So where are currencies right now? Because the rail has done well against the dollar. Yes, it has. So here's the month to date on the Wi-Fi interactive showing that the US dollar is actually sunk about 3% over the month of October versus the rail. And that's versus gaining versus a lot of these other currencies. You can see in the upper left up, 7% versus a rubles, 6.7% of the Argentine peso. So what I want to point out is the Brazil was actually hiking race. They were the first among all the developing companies and the developed companies, countries, excuse me, who began raising rates. And that was earlier in 2021. So going back to let's say March, they were raising rates in a time where most people were cutting, most people in the Fed were talking about the transient inflation. And they were taking the seriously. As a result, they haven't suffered as much pain as a lot of the other currencies. And I'm not just talking developing market currencies. I'm talking the developed ones, like the Yen and the Euro. And just a circle and put a nice bow on everything's with respect to the Federal Reserve this Wednesday. I think this is going to be pivotal, because if J. Powell doubles down on his strategy on the Jackson Hole saying, we are going to hike no matter what in the face of all this and doesn't really stand down, doesn't use those words. And there's going to be a lot of questions. I just hesitate to think what's going to happen for the risk markets. Because a lot of this perceived dovishness has already baked into that. Jared Blykorey and Alex Enner-Samanova, thank you so much for joining us. And to that point, Jared, with the Federal Reserve set to raise rates by 75 basis points for a fourth consecutive meeting, investors are trying to battle the twin headwinds of recession risks and tighter monetary conditions. For more, let's welcome in Fred Hubeler, Creative Capital Wealth Management Group President and Chief Wealth Strategist. We're also joined by Gitu Sharma, Alpha's Future Founder and Investment Manager. Gitu, let's start with you. The Fed expected to raise rates by 75 basis points then in December, who knows if it's 50 or 25 basis points or if it's opposed there. What are you expecting and what are you expecting the markets to do? Hi. I agree with you. There's a lot of uncertainty out there right now. And this week is going to be quite telling. The 75-bit state hike in November is very much priced in and we can expect the Fed to give that. But December is looking, the market itself is not sure what December is going to be. But we have seen a bit more dovish expectations in the market. We've seen a very strong rally in equities and bonds. And but I think there is a risk that actually the Fed, even if they want to keep that option of reducing the rate high pace in December, I think that the Fed is actually not going to be as dovish as the market is expecting. And there are a number of reasons for that. I think firstly, while the economy is slowing, which is what the Fed wants, we are not seeing the pace of slowdown as much as they would like to see. Inflation remains very high. And inflation expectations for the long term we saw the recent consumer expectations have actually come in higher. And so given how strong the US consumer is, the spending remains strong. And the other important metric that the Fed looks at, which is the unemployment rate is actually the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,67,2022-10-31 18:39:25
4469," As consumer is, the spending remains strong and the other important metric that the Fed looks at, which is the unemployment rate is actually the lowest ever. So as long as we have these conditions, I think the Fed is likely to stay focused on monetary tightening because the last thing they want is the inflation expectations to get even more entrenched than what they already are. And Fred, are you expecting the Fed to stay hawkish? And if so, what impacts could we see? Because so many market watchers talk about this six to nine month lag time between what the Fed does and what we see in the economy. We already have seen what has happened in England with the pension funds and what the Bank of England has had to do. Do you see any cracks happening in other parts of the economy, whether it be here in the US or abroad? Yeah, we see a lot of cracks. And at the end of the day, the Fed's job isn't to make the market happy. And they have decided and have determined more than once. They're going to keep doing what they need to do to break inflation. The analogy we've been using with our clients is there's blood on the streets. It hasn't gotten to your door yet. So until the consumer slows spending, we're not going to see a lot of inflation cap down. People are still buying things. And once the consumer changes their and they're starting to change their behavior, then the sales that companies are affecting won't be as much as they thought. And you're seeing it with mixed earnings in the third quarter. So it's a lag from consumer behavior rippling through the economy. The expectations for the market are almost always in their best interest and the market's best interest. So they want things to happen so bad they talk about. They kind of telegraph what their intentions are. And I think the Fed's going to do what it needs to do. And I think there's pain that needs to happen that isn't yet reflected in all the numbers we're seeing. And the pain would be more job losses, companies slowing down growth and maybe even doing some layoffs. And the cracks are almost everywhere. And there's not many places where between COVID, inflation, and the excess spending, and even what's going on in energy, all those places are kind of happening at the same time. And what concerns us is more fixed income and equities. It's very frothy. And when we're supposed to have a bad month, we have the best month we've ever had. So the only thing good news is the Yahu Skit segment about watches makes me want to buy watches so we can spend some time looking at the markets. Gitu, just speaking to where investors should they be looking at watches or not, what do investors do here? How do investors position themselves? Because you say the international markets are really attractive on a pure valuation basis. Are you suggesting going into international markets and what type of assets if so? Well, so I think international markets are attractive on a valuation basis, but we also have a higher risk of recession there. So I think the risk is higher in those markets. And that is what is getting priced in. So no, it's not that I'm absolutely recommending investing in international markets because I think the US economy is very strong. And US companies are a lot more resilient, a lot more defensive, have higher pricing power. And we have a attractive dollar which makes international markets less attractive in their local currency. So no, I'm not recommending that, but it is something that we are watching. And if we do see a recovery in the economic environment, we see a resolution to the world or some kind of supply chain normalization across China and other countries, then potentially we could see attractive opportunities there. And Fred, just quickly, your bullish on energy. Energy has done very well this year. You still see a runway there? So looking at the longer term, energy is the thing that makes modern society work. Now where we get it from is a whole other conversation. But at the end of the day, I'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,68,2022-10-31 18:43:40
4470," So looking at the longer term, energy is the thing that makes modern society work. Now where we get it from is a whole other conversation, but at the end of the day, energy in more developing countries is not even where it needs to be for everyone to have what they want. So although we might not see, we're kind of being more efficient with energy use in North America, the energy isn't even getting where it needs to be over places. So at the end of the day, I think the use of energy exploded 16 times in the 1900s. The growth of energy is what makes modern life possible. So when you're looking at what can't go wrong, we all need to plug into something. And so recessions, people still need to want to have their lights on and their heat. Where it comes from is a longer conversation, but at the end of the day, I think there is always going to be demand for energy. And with what's going on with you train and Russia, it makes it more of an awareness that energy is national security. And we need to make sure that as a country and countries around the world need to make sure they have the energy. If they have the deposits, they have the way to get that out of the ground for their own self interest. Gitu Sharma, Alpha's future founder and investment manager and Fred Hubler, creative capital wealth management group president. Thank you both for joining us today. And now for our trending ticker of the day, GameStop. The video game retailer Stock is up today. The stock is up 23% actually over the last five sessions, breaking the $28 level on Friday. And short interest on this stock is just about 20%. That's high. Bob Sloan, the CEO of Data Analytics firm S3 partners recently told Yahoo Finance, if the stock goes past 30, you could see something parabolic and the stock is right now past 30. In fact, it was halted for volatility earlier this morning. And coming up, Shanghai Disney have roughly closed in order to comply with COVID measures with visitors unable to leave. Stay tuned for the latest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,69,2022-10-31 18:48:10
4471," China's COVID-19 curbs forced the closure of Disney's Shanghai Resort, so it could comply with COVID-19 prevention measures. Park visitors present at the time of the announcement were required to remain until they return a negative test. That's a latest public health measure as rising case numbers from outbreaks across China have prompted a tightening of local curb and lockdowns. Yahoo, finances, Angelie Kamlani joins us now with the latest Angelie, these COVID lockdowns really continuing to create problems in China. That's right. And Disney just being one of the latest to have to deal with that. This coming after 10 cases reported locally in Shanghai as local transmission forcing the government to start that strict lockdown of that area, of course, with mass crowds. As of right now, we do know that the park, it will be indefinitely closed. Those who are already in the park do have to return a negative test. There were already strict measures in place and the park had just reopened at the end of June. And so those who are stuck inside are dealing with the same restrictions that were in place, which is a negative test at least 72 hours before entry or no entry for those who had traveled abroad or who were living domestically in high transmission areas. Right now, the park site says that it's uncertain about when it will reopen. And so those ticket holders who are looking to visit with the next coming days and weeks are going to have to contend with either rebooking at a time once they know an opening date or asking for a refund. So that's where things stand right now. And Angelie, speaking of coming days and weeks, let's take a look at COVID and the variants and what's coming for this winter. What should people watch out for here in the U.S.? So we've seen something interesting kind of happen over the weekend and tracking these variants. We know there's the XBB that's taken hold in Singapore as well as other countries, including India and Bangladesh. And we've seen an interesting trend, which is not an increase in death. So that's one positive sign. However, we have seen increased cases. Now, we know that the QB1 and QB1 one here in the U.S. is already starting to grow nearly a quarter or actually past a quarter of cases now. So what this trends for in terms of how hard the winter will be is actually still unclear. And I know we've seen a lot of uncertainty. We've had guests on just prior to me talking about the uncertainty of the winter. And that holds true too for coronavirus. As we know, there's also the focus on the flu RSV and COVID circulating all at the same time. So things still uncertain, but experts really prompting or asking for individuals to stay cautious, remain cautious and take all the preventative measures possible. Angela, Kamlani, tracking everything COVID related. Thank you, Angela. And the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments today on a pair of cases that could decide the future of affirmative action in higher education. Yahoo, finances, Alexis Keenan has a details. Alexis, affirmative action is something that's been debated for years, but these cases are significant. Decades, right? So this is a big deal. There are two cases that the Supreme Court is listening to oral arguments from two different universities as well as a challenger to this affirmative action law that we have right now in the United States. The action is brought by an organization called Students for Fair Admission and along with a conservative activist who funds that group called his name is Edward Blum. They're saying that both the Constitution and civil rights laws prohibit universities from considering race and ethnicity as a factor in college admissions. So the two respondents here are Harvard as well as the University of North Carolina. Those are the two groups that are having to stand up and defend their policies in the way that they admit college applicants. Now in the University of North Carolina's case, that's a public university and then Harvard on the other side is a private university. So that's why you're getting some different laws being applied here with the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,70,2022-10-31 18:52:17
4472," So you have North Carolina's case, that's a public university, and then Harvard on the other side is a private university. So that's why you're getting some different laws being applied here with the petitioner saying that the University of North Carolina is violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, which says all the laws have to be applied equally. But then Harvard's case, they're saying that Harvard is violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. And that bars organizations that take federal funds from using race as a discriminatory factor. So a little bit different argument there, but in the end the judges are going to have to decide whether or not they're going to overturn just decades and decades of law that has permitted universities to go ahead and include race as a factor. And the arguments are already underway. That would be significant. The Biden administration also filed a brief in support of the university. So what's the argument there? Yeah, so you have the Biden administration, you have corporations, you have professors at universities, you have a lot of Amicus briefs filed here, front of the court briefs, and they are proponents for the universities being able to continue using race as a factor. And we should also note that right now, Harvard is saying that 40% of universities in this country actually continue this practice and use race as a factor, not as the deciding factor, that's a big issue that the justices have already been asking questions about. But what the corporations, the Biden administration are saying is that if you take this away, if you take this fuel for diversity away at the university level, that then you're going to impact the corporate level as well as the federal level. And including the U.S. military, they say all of these institutions need diversity and they're better by having this diversity. They're equipped, more efficient, will impact U.S. business and they say we need to get that in at the university level because that's from where we're recruiting for our future business leaders. Oh, the fascinating. We'll be watching Alexis Keenan. Thanks so much for joining us. And coming up, change is to Twitter, Elon Musk already talking about changing the blue check mark verification system. We'll discuss what else he might have in store.

4473,"class Ewan Musk wasting no time making changes at Twitter, reportedly working and tweeting into the weekend to review everything from Twitter's code to its advertising. The recent staffed remains done for cause could present the company with another firestorm, joining us now with Insight Rich Greenfield, partner and media and technology analyst at LightShed Partners. Rich, thanks so much for joining us. Let's start with some of what happened over the weekend on Twitter. And the verge saying that Twitter is charging, is going to charge $20 a month for verification. What do you make of that? Look, I think that there's a lot of power uses of Twitter that would clearly pay businesses, you know, a lot of creators that use this as a business and use Twitter. I mean, you see a lot of influencers on social media. Twitter is where they speak to their fans. And so is there a large group of people that use Twitter, you know, from a business aspect and would absolutely pay every brand in America or every brand around the world, looks to see what people are saying about their brand. They don't care whether you're dealt to airlines or your HBO, you're listening to what Twitter is saying. And so are there lots of organizations and people that would pay for Twitter as part of and sort of a premium product or premium tier with analytics and information, including a blue check mark? Absolutely. We've been talking about a subscription business for years. So obviously they rolled out Twitter blue. Happy Monday and happy Halloween here on Yahoo Finance live. I'm Rachelle Coofer along with Dave Briggs. We're an hour away from the closing bell and markets starting the weekend on a jittery stream. So beautiful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,72,2022-10-31 19:01:12
4474," Happy Monday and Happy Halloween here on Yahoo Finance Live. I'm Rachelle Acuffa, along with Dave Friggs. We're an hour away from the closing bell and markets. Starting the week here on a jittery note, let's take a look here and that's after last week's gains. We're seeing investors brazen for the next rate hike with the last Fed meeting before the midterm elections kicking off tomorrow and of course jobs date at this week. Techno look here you see the Dow is off by about a third of a percent there. The S&P 500 losing more there down about 0.6% and having the biggest trouble so far today, the Nasdaq down almost 1% there. Now we know that October is ending with something of a whimper for stocks as high a treasury yields a weighing on sentiment but the month has actually been a strong one for equities. So do we have corporate America to thank? Well for that our very own Jared Blickery has the latest and the stats that matter. Hey, Jared. Hi there, Rachelle. I guess it depends which corporation you're talking to. Let's take a look at the majors here. Everything except the Russell 2000 in the red including the TSI X-Zutronto Exchange. That is only today and I want to check out the Dow. This is the month of October. Actually let me put this here. This is the month of October and you can see up 14% nice gain for the Dow. In fact that is the best October for the Dow ever going back to 1896. The inception of that index. Let me just show you what's happened inside volatility for the month of October. Caterwise in that move higher is VIX. That is fear moving lower. You can see down from currently trading at 26 right now but it had been higher over the month and we want to take a quick check of the bond market as well. Here's the five year T-note yield. That is up just about five basis points today at about 4.24%. I'm going to show you the very short end of the curve. That is creeping higher as well. Almost meeting the tenure. That is at 3.98% just short of 4% that is of one basis point today. Finally the big tail that's waging the dog recently especially this year the US dollar index. That is down 1% over the trading months and that has been enough to catalyze and move higher in risk appetite. That's soaring dollar earlier in the year. Definitely weighing on stocks then but not this month. Now today it is a look mainly of red except for energy but let's go back to that month's to date view and you can see every single sector in the red even communication services. That is what houses meted down 75% for the year but energy up 25% industrials up nearly 14 financials 12 health care nine materials nine and staples just short of that as well. The top row all of those outperforming in the month of October here and here's a look at the NASDAQ 100. You can really see there are some winners some big winners and some big losers. Winner here is Apple just kind of flying out of the gate late last week off those earnings Amazon down 10% Tesla down 14% meanwhile in video and PepsiCo creeping up on video's market cap both of those up about 11% for the month Dave. That's easy to see but it's easy to see that Halloween themed tie on the camera at least I believe it to be a Halloween theme tie. Otherwise I would be in trouble here because I'm not going to wear this on a normal day but hey I might even have a pocket square orange pocket square dig that out of my oh thank you guys that is beautiful. I'm gonna see if I can dig that out of my desk for the 4 p.m. I think I may have one that might work but nice job I did not get the memo I guess I forgot the calendar thank you Jared good stuff all right the event of the week no doubt is the fed's rate decision with the 75 point basis hike looking like a lock at this point on top of this result season continues in fratis payroll report also on the docket so how should investors be positioned we're joined by Mahoney asset management CEO Ken Mahoney Ken good to see you sir we're gonna do all of that the moment but first where do you make of the fact that the Dow having its best month since the 70s and you think about like you know coming to October is always spooky right I mean nice theme there I'm missing my tie store about that me too I'll put you know you think about that October you know 1929 stock market crash October 19 1987 stock market crash and of course 2008 that October kind of too big to fail financial crisis so we've had a lot of experience and crash in October but I think what's set the stage for this October was a really nasty self-september actually took out some of the losses prior to but it's nice to see again we'll see where we go from here but it's nice to see all these kind of goblins that go around in October yeah it's nice to see the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,73,2022-10-31 19:05:21
4475," actually took out some of the losses prior to. But it's nice to see, again, we'll see where we go from here, but it's nice to see all these kind of goblins that go around in October. Yeah, it's nice to see the bulls jump on board here and really come back after a really rough September. Now, can we have seen this enthusiasm before followed by the winds sort of coming out of the sales once they sort of passed through the comments that came from power later? And you talk about focusing on the commentary, not just the bit, the 75 bases point hype that we're expecting. What are you looking for? Perhaps in the comments. So I think it's going to be belligerent again. That's my best word for him since the Jackson Hole Conference about race. Now, a couple of weeks ago, it got out there that maybe they'll pivot, maybe they'll pause. And I think that's why the market rallied so much. And this could be unfortunately a replay from just a quarter ago where we had the same thing that earnings came through from burner. Some of the problems we had about inflation, the Fed went to the back burner and the market rally absence of that. We've had a quiet period a dark period for the Fed, which is nice because it's nauseating 19 speeches a day at the Fed governors. It's nice to actually have a little break here from that. But on Tuesday, Wednesday, 2.30, the question answers, that's where the rubber is going to hit the road. And my guess is, not as a lot has changed as far as inflation data from then to come off this kind of a little bit of a litter and stance. So we may wind up giving back some of this October gain. If in fact, the Fed is not looking to pivot anytime soon. I believe we get no economic projections in November. So added emphasis on the commentary from Powell. Over the weekend, Goldman added 25 point hike to their projections. So now it's 75, 50, 25, and February 25 again in March with a terminal rate around 475 to 5. Is that how you see it? Yeah, I could go there. Look, the competition for stocks, I mean, we all know higher rates. It affects credit cards, equity lines, mortgage, and so forth. But the bottom line is it's competition stocks. I mean, two years ago, it's trading a point 5%. What is it? Look, a four and a half percent now, the two year treasury, that starts bumping up. That's huge competition for stocks, especially those big pension fund managers, institutions that manage tens of billions of dollars. You know, they're boggy 6% and they get chunk of that a four and a half 5%. They probably don't want to take too much more risk after that. And I want to ask you about energy prices. It's that the outstanding performer of the day, but also for the month as well. But obviously, this is an issue that's been going back and forth. What are your expectations in and how much that's going to weigh on the inflation picture? Right. So we've been in this kind of trading range, I would say, from 85 to 89 dollars a barrel for the last several weeks. Though the individual stocks lifting, of course, your favorite ETF XLE lifting this month. Exxon today was higher and a little bit lower about the windfall tax. It's kind of strange when oil is your leader. You technically, again, I really like to see when technology is leading or other sectors because when energy is leading, that's also hurting the consumer. So again, there are component to the Dow Jones, component to all different indexes. But there's a double-edged sword to that one right, the old side of it that hurts consumers and acts like a foreign tax or different or some type of attacks to the hour's consumer dealing with this. So given the context, the setup that you just laid out, what's your advice to investors going forward? If you had a nice profit out of it, there's nothing wrong. You don't have to be here or here. Try to take some money off. You know, this, we're still in a bear market. It's a nice bounce that we've had. I hate to throw wet, you know, wet talent or wet blanket on it. But if you look at it chart, we're still training downward with the nice little pop this month. So if you have some gains this month, nothing wrong cultivating some of them. We don't know exactly the Federal Reserve is going to do. The expectation has been that they're going to pivot and pause. I don't see that. I see them coming back and being kind of aggressive and perhaps gold and right and maybe it could be worse than that. But you start getting into a 4.75 to 5% Fed fund rates. That's not a good set up for stocks. I mean, and speaking of stocks, I mean, it's been a bit of a mixed back on its come to earning season here. What's your take on your expectations for how we should really be looking at earning season given some of the backdrop of what we're dealing with right now? Well, last week, you remind me of the Survivor TV show, right? It's like, okay, someone has to go home. I mean, someone's off the island and that was meta. They sent them off the island. It was Amazon. It was Microsoft. I mean, seriously, it was a tough week. It's amazing that the market held up so well. And the loan survivor, Apple. So Apple, they're pretty well again, buying back shares, EPS and so forth. So, you know, that's our leadership and each and every one of them, unfortunately, had a negative result, but we did see somebody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,74,2022-10-31 19:09:47
4476," Apple, they're pretty well again, buy-and-back shares, EPS, and so forth. So that's our leadership, and each and every one of them, unfortunately, had a negative result. But we did see some money going to like Kanye well, and somebody's industrial, why the Dow is outperforming the S&P when the S&P's outperforming Nasdaq. And that's still not into this winning streak, so it's very, very slightly. The last week, definitely expectations were low coming into the season, though Dow. But unfortunately, we saw a lot of technique, including Google, Amazon, Don or Blitz and Kamikudel, all these different big companies, really saw themselves down 10, 15% after hours. So it was not a good place to be last week. And they took another hit today, and the Nasdaq is up, albeit less than 4%, compared to the almost 14% for the Dow. Could anything encourage you to get back in on tech in the short term? No, it's going to take a couple of quarters. Right now, anytime a stock does that, and they give guidance lower, analysts continue to downgrade, then as an investor, you find yourself like a quick sand, that's where we are. Honestly, to see the Googles and Microsofts and those types of names again, that's just fine to see two or three quarters of positive growth and some type of positive commentary of guidance. But until that time, I think it's me dead money or worse, like you said, the quick sand type of money. Yes, dead money or worse, quick sand. Strong words there, we do thank you for joining us, Ken Mahoney for your commentary. Thanks so much. Well, Chief Twitt, Elon Musk, cementing control of Twitter in a new security filing, Musk not only cleaned house of executives of Twitter when he took over the company, but also the board. Now, the board was dissolved on Thursday after the deal, and Musk is now the sole director of the company's board. There is now also a report that Musk is looking to bring back Vine by years end. Now, Vine, of course, was Twitter's video looping up, but it was shut down back in 2016. And now, Axios is reporting that Musk wants engineers to take a look at the source code. Now Musk tweeted over the weekend, asking users, if he should bring it back. So Dave, what do you think? Obviously, this is something when you thought of the things that perhaps Musk would be doing when he took on Twitter. Bringing back Vine wasn't on my bingo code. No, it's really hard to foresee what Elon is up to in the next 24 hours at this point. It's going to be wildly unpredictable. The only thing we thought we would see in the short term is a lot of layoffs, and it appears to be around a quarter, at least if you read reports. Yeah, bringing Vine back, I think actually is a smart move. I think Mr. Beast, who right now is probably the most influential social media creator on the planet, some say a valuation north of a billion dollars based on the business he's building out of his YouTube creation. But yeah, I think Vine is actually a play. Ultimately, you have to, at this point, Michelle, find a way to compete with TikTok. Everyone has a TikTok problem. Everyone has an ad environment problem. And perhaps Vine is the way you do compete with TikTok. I never actually used Vine. Maybe I just kind of missed that way, did you? I dipped my toe in it wasn't really impressed, but I mean, we've come a long way. You have things like YouTube, shorts, Instagram, everyone's sort of coming up with their own version of it. Still not quite nailing it the way that TikTok is obviously, but interesting trying to bring it back. We'll see how far he goes with that. All right, we'll keep it moving here, because we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live. Coming up, Elon Musk is reportedly looking to ramp up fees for verify Twitter users. And a new survey reveals that finances are on the minds of many Americans, as they head to the voting booths. And US Surgeon General, Vivek Murty, tells us what Americans should be doing with a potential triple-demick looming. Don't go anywhere.

4477," First I'll add 6 dc Twitter is reportedly considering charging verified users $20 a month for Twitter blue or verified as some call according to the verge. This comes during a growing trend of subscription fees as social media companies try and turn a profit in this environment at the end of Q3 1.5 million people were paying for Snapchat Plus, $5 a month subscription service giving them access to some exclusive features. And even on dating apps like Bumble, you can pay to get advanced filters for your profile or go into incognito or travel mode. We're sure the question is, are you paying almost $20 a month to stay verified? No, thank you. I know a lot of us as journalists, the way we use it is because you don't want someone to attribute something to a fake version of you. But if you're just a regular person and you want to be verified, if it comes with some sort of benefits, as you mentioned, when you compare it to things like Bumble, you get a lot of extra features. But if it's just to be verified, I don't think it's worth it. I would hope that even before we had verifications and things, people would actually want the information and wanted to be correct, verify it or not. I'm still not paying $20 to be very good. What would you pay? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Well, that was actually the most... I use it for work. What about you? That was the most popular answer when Jason Callacannis, excuse me, investor asked that question on Twitter and they had a million and a half people replied to that poll and you look at the results. Almost 82% said nothing. Maybe there's some optimism there because 10% agreed that they would pay five bucks a month. I'm with you, Richelle. Maybe I'd pay a buck or two a month. I don't frankly care about the verification. Maybe there are some people that do. I did sit around with this is my un-scientific poll with a bunch of Wall Street investor types of a couple of weeks ago. All of them said they would pay between $20 and $50 per month to stay on Twitter. They said that service is that valuable to them as a work tool. How do you monetize just to select few when you're looking to monetize the 200 million plus users? I don't know if you can have various tiers depending upon your usage. Maybe that is the model he settles with. But clearly you've got a bunch of people who want no-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,76,2022-10-31 19:18:30
4478," I don't know if you can have various tiers depending upon your usage. Maybe that is the model he settles with, but clearly you've got a bunch of people who want no part of paying for Twitter or paying for the little blue checkmark for Shell. No, I mean, I would pay for Twitter itself. I do find it a useful service. The verification part, I wouldn't bother paying for it, but to actually stay on Twitter, I mean, it's good, it's fast, it's a good way to sort of get the information. I mean, a wide range of information. So I do get useful in this there. The verification, I'm definitely not pressed on. Yeah, I think the issue is had they done it a couple of years ago, right before we were all so fatigued by subscription services, our Netflix, our Disney, our Hulu, we've all got three, four, five subscription services, and all those prices have been going up. Apple plus just raised their prices. I think we all have subscription fatigue. And so it comes at a tough time, especially ahead of a recession. And it's probably not the right time to be hitting people up, but they'll have to find a way. I agree, that's just one more thing. And speaking of one, and then there was one Elon Musk already making big changes at Twitter. Today, a filing revealing he's dissolved the social media giant's entire board of directors, except of course for himself. Now, it's one of several big changes the billionaire is bringing to the now private company. Here to discuss more about what Musk might do is Steve Jang, Kendra Adventures founding, managing partner. So as we take a look at these initial steps, obviously, we know that Musk likes to turn to Twitter for polls and ideas about things. Are we getting now a clearer idea of what we can expect with a Twitter under Musk? Well, look, he overpaid for a social media company that survives off of online advertising. In this economy, he is performing one of the largest tech LBOs in history in a really soft and thrashy online advertising market coming into Q4. So he is created a big hole for himself to crawl out of. He's got a team around him that's pretty smart and they've been working at the HQ over the weekend and through this week to try to clean up the team in their view and create the team that will let him go back to running Tesla and SpaceX as well. So he doesn't want to do this full-time long term. So he is in a crash course right now inside of Twitter probably. And from what I'm hearing inside, there are a lot of junior people that weren't exactly senior executives that are getting uplifted. And as you've seen, a lot of the senior people are out. Well, you're the perfect example, Steve, because that Steve Jang is verified 40,000 followers. How much, sir, would you pay for the service that is Twitter and the verification? And if it's not the subscription model, how else does he build this new company that can reemerge as a public company in five years or so? Look, I mean, on the topic of monetization, no one wants to be fully online advertising supported, whether it's becoming a marketplace and selling goods between supply and demand or whether it's creating subscriptions. That's the future of all of these social platforms. You look at what Facebook is doing. The reason why they're getting hammered right now is that they're investing like a startup wood in a totally new area that has a five to ten year story. For Twitter, I think monetization is not just about the blue check. It's about subscriptions around data analytics, creator, publisher, media tools, community follower management. All of these things are sort of out there as third party services, but they're not good. Twitter doesn't have a robust API anymore. So bringing all that back in, creating a natural developer API for media to use, for Web three companies, for media streaming, for like the reddit, the discord of the world, even the Shopify's of the world. That is, they have such a huge opportunity. It's incredible. If you think about media, Web three, media streaming, all of these, they were some of the innovators 10 years ago in these areas. You're right to bring up Vine. Big talk is essentially a better version of Vine. You think about reddit and discord. That was Twitter's opportunity as well. And you know, if you look at the history of all social platforms, all these community services, if they succeed, it's because they eventually become a marketplace. Twitter has not crossed that chasm. They're not a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,77,2022-10-31 19:22:39
4479," the history of all social platforms, all these community services, if they succeed, it's because they eventually become a marketplace. Twitter has not crossed that chasm. They are not a marketplace yet. You don't go there to sell products. You don't go there to buy products. You go there to talk about them, but then you move off. And that's a huge opportunity as well. Yeah, they want to become this X app, almost like we chat some say, but you didn't answer the question. How much would you pay for Twitter? You know what? I would pay $100 a month for what I do. Venture Capital, early stage venture capital, we find founders to back through Twitter. They come find us through what we talk about. I don't even blog anymore. Blogging just seems passé and time consuming. We tweet about things. We can pull out our phone and tweet about things. So getting analytics, getting creator, publisher tools around that, being able to manage and see who my followers are, what my community is. I mean, $100 sounds like a bargain. And we've seen that the price of Dogecoin, obviously one of Musk's favorite, crypto's that he likes to tweet about, actually doubled in the month of October. Do you see him perhaps incorporating that into some of the payment systems as a way to really get Doge more in the front line? I think that the Doge thing is a red herring and kind of a distraction. Look, Elon has always said that he has a love hate with crypto. So he's not a full web 3 believer at all. And also Jack Dorsey, prior CEO, he's about Bitcoin, but he's not necessarily a web 3 proponent if you see what he's doing with block. So inside of that company, there are some web 3 proponents on the product side that are absolutely talented. It makes total sense for crypto wallet integration to happen for your Twitter profile and feed. It makes total sense to be able to have streaming media and NFTs and Dow's and all these things happening. Because guess what? The entire crypto industry, their conversation is happening on Twitter already. So it makes total sense. And I think this and there's some basic low hanging fruit too. Think about every time you click on a New York Times article link or a Wall Street Journal link and you get a paywall, even though you're a subscriber. Low hanging fruit, have an authentication into your account so that you never have to see that paywall. So these are the types of things that I think everyone inside of Twitter product engineering design, I think that they're eager to fix. And I think, you know, my hope is that Elon and team will allow that common sense and that product that I'll pick up again. I should. Sounds like Elon should give you a call. So Twitter like Uber, moved on from its founder, Travis Kalanick out, they report tomorrow, curious your expectations for Uber after a really solid quarterly earnings beat last quarter, stock down, although about 40% this year. Yeah, you know, like Uber has a complex storytelling problem. One, because of the past history and all of the drama, but also because they have a lot of stuff going on in terms of acquisitions and outside holdings with all these non cash charges. So if you strip away all of that last quarter for the first time they hit positive free cash flow, which is amazing. This was the major thing that people were saying, this company can never go get profitable. And they've proven that. They've also proven that they are the utility network globally for mobility and logistics. No one comes even close, DD doesn't come close. Door dash is great at delivery, but they're only in the US. Lift is only in the US for ride sharing. So this is really a proxy for whether or not, you know, mobility and logistics enabled by technologies can award. So this quarter is really important, because this is where they show, hey, this edge, this advantage they have over all these other competitors should shine right now. Inflation is a driver in some ways for Uber. People want to go back to work. They want to earn more, they want to drive on the ride sharing and delivery side. This is very unique to Uber. So we'll see the numbers tomorrow, but my expectation is that Dara and team are pushing very, very hard for profitability to continue to show that. And they're going to be leveraging and really extracting value out of this dual network that they have. Yeah, I'll be really curious to hear commentary from Dara on ads both on the app and the tablets testing in San Francisco and Los Angeles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,78,2022-10-31 19:27:05

Stay tuned to learn what's spooking investors a day before the company reports earnings. I've got to go out next. Welcome back everyone. It's time for Triple Play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. You've got Airbnb, win results and till rate on deck and our very own Josh Schaefer is joining us today. So let's start with my pick which is Airbnb, the home rental company under some pressure today and that's ahead of its earnings report for Q3 that's out tomorrow. Now it's interesting as the company has enjoyed an earnings beat for the last five quarters. The street is expecting earnings per share of $1.47, a 20.5% year-over-year increase on revenue of $2.84 billion. That's about 26.8% higher than the same quarter last year. It was interesting because longer term stays of 28 days or more are actually Airbnb's fastest growing category versus 2019 and should still be a boost for Q3. Investors will be eyeing it as a gauge of where the consumer is, especially when you consider a softening labor market and of course more pressure from employers to return to the office instead of some of these longer stay places that people are renting out. According to Seeking Alpha, Airbnb actually has more runs listed on its platform than the top five hotel chainsab in the portfolio combined and that's on top of competing with traditional hotels with seeing Airbnb also expecting growth with its experiences booked units. It's a really trying to branch out here Josh. Yeah, Michelle, I'm excited for this call mainly because I think we get a great idea of the consumer and also where Americans are at in terms of return to work. You mentioned that long term stay has been a consistent growth spot for Airbnb. Does that continue again into this quarter and does it keep continuing?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,79,2022-10-31 19:31:48
4481," and also where Americans are at in terms of return to work. You mentioned that long-term stay has been a consistent growth spot for Airbnb. Does that continue again into this quarter and does it keep continuing to grow as it has been? As we do see more and more people returning to the office, I'm curious if that part of the business maybe fades a little bit. But my point today is when, when shares are soaring, up about 10%, you can see there. And that says billionaire Tom and Fertida revealed a 6% stake in the casino company. Fertida has a long history of success in the restaurant and casino space, including his company's ownership of Golden Nugget. Now this makes Fertida the second highest individual shareholder of win resorts that's according to FACSET. And he's behind only founder Elaine Wynn. Much needed positive news for the stock here today. That's a stock that's been down 26% roughly year to date. And we know what's going on in China right now with more COVID outbreaks. And really just COVID lockdowns. We've seen them continue to no matter what the numbers are. They want to walk down the country a little bit more. It seems, and of course, Wynn has those big casinos out in Macau that are a large portion of the revenue. They've been waiting to see if those are going to come back. Stock probably would have been down today, we should say, with some of the news coming out of China if it wasn't for this. And that's what I was thinking. As soon as I saw you make this pick, I thought, oh God, they must be down another 5% to 10% based on COVID lockdowns. But it's not just Wynn. When you look at MGM, they're basically flat on the day. LVS is actually up Las Vegas Sands up about 3.5%. So it is shocking. This is totally separate now until when. But the three biggest US-based stocks with Macau exposure are not hurting. And the reports out of China look to be devastating in terms of the business. They've already had a very rough year in Macau. And we're going to show you later what happened in Shanghai, Disney, and across the country. You would think these stocks would be pummeled, but that is not the case. Stocks that have also been hammered this year, my play. Pot stocks, surging higher, unoptimistic words from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer says Congress is, quote, very close to passing cannabis banking and expungement legislation. After having progressed with, quote, a bunch of Republican senators, which folks, that is stunning. We have not heard a single word about optimism from Republicans. The legislation would open up traditional banking services to legal cannabis companies, while also erasing criminal records for marijuana convictions. They're comments on what's now called safe banking plus act made an debate on Sunday for Schumer. Similar legislation has passed the House more than a half a dozen times and just died. No traction in the Senate. Just taking a very sampling of pot stocks, canopy growth, up massive, about 18 percent till raise up a dozen. Truly, up about nine, truly, about six, green leaves up about nine, a cannabis-themed ETF MJ. Upsoldly, so this is across the board. Great day, great rally for pot stocks. And this makes sense to me. The last time when we talked about optimism for federal legislation, there will not be federal legalization anytime soon. Four, six, maybe even eight years. This is what businesses needed, Rochelle, they needed banking certainty even more than legalization. I mean, but you have to think, we've got midterm elections coming up. How much of a priority is this for your average voter? I get that for the companies that are in this, you know, this is their season. But people have so much also on their minds when they look at the economy, when they look at inflation. I don't know if this is perhaps that last bit of razzle dazzle perhaps, drum up a bit more support for the Democrats as we go into the midterms, but hopefully this is not short-lived enthusiasm. But I'm not sold on this yet, until I actually see everything paused. I'm upbeat on this solely because the lame duck. I think they could get something done in the lame duck session. That's what I've been hearing out of DC all along. Josh Schaefer, thank you for being here, my friend. Coming up, the push to unionize its Starbucks, slowing down. What could be behind the change? Next. Next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,80,2022-10-31 19:35:46
4482," The the After a pandemic driven surge in both new and used car prices, shoppers may soon see some relief at car dealerships around the country joining us now with more on this is seeing your auto's reporter pros to Romanian. So why and how significant might the reductions be? You know, we saw some new data at JD Power that were seeing a little bit of moderation, like a tad, so we're at $45,600 for a new car in October, which is down a couple thousand from July, but still a lot of money, still 33% higher than it was pre-pandemic. So there's a long way to go, right? So it's not like it's fixed itself, right? So the number of things that play, right? You have kind of lots of unmet demand people wanting to kind of update their cars, a lot of old cars out there. You still got to supply chain issues where it supplies the coming down, a lot of manufacturers still like retrofitting chips into cars so they can get them out of dealerships. And also things like creative financing, you know, people are willing to pay a lot of money for cars and doing like 84-month term loans. So that's a thing that's happening. We're mentioning that to us and I was quite, quite frankly surprised by that. Wow, 84 months. So then will prices ever come back down to where they were pre-pandemic or was that time just sort of coming going at this point? You know, we're starting to see the slight kind of down-tick here. A lot of recent CPI data is shown that a couple percentage points each month. Back to that Ford, the Ford CFO told us also that some F-150 Lightning buyers are downgrading from the upper trim layer to the XLT because it's cheaper. They still want the truck but they don't want to pay that much. So you're seeing a little bit there but I got to be honest with you, I feel like you'll never see those days of 17 million, 18 million cars sold a year because of the fact that the automakers like their fat margins, like big juicy fat profit margins where they can sell fewer cars at a higher price and that works just fine for them. I think we saw back in those days where entry-level cars were like sub-$20,000 cars. You can't find that anymore. So in my mind, the entry-level cars are used cars. That's where the market is now and new cars are just for people that have a bit more money, want that nicer, newer cars, all the new features. Good. And you don't even see those little floaty things outside of the dealership setting more. Come, come.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,81,2022-10-31 19:40:24
4483," Want that nicer, newer car with all the new features? Good. You don't even see those little floaty things outside of the dealership setting more. They're like, look, if you want a comb, comb, goodness, it's tough times out there. Brought supermania. Thanks so much. All right, what's safety giz now to Starbucks. They're cafes hoping to join the Starbucks workers, workers United Labor Union slowed considerably this fall. Now, just 12 stores actually filed petitions for representation last month. That's down from a high of 71 in March. According to the National Labor Relations Board. Now, since the first stores voted in Buffalo, New York late last year, the board has certified unions in 243 of the company's 9,000 stores across the country. Last week, Starbucks entered into bargaining processes with 41 unionized cafes and has proposed dates for another 43. Now, the coffee giant has responded in the months since, offering new benefits to non-union stores, including wage increases and operational and equipment improvements, some of the things that they had been calling for. It does make sense that if they're investing these hundreds of millions of dollars to make conditions better and make pay better as well, it's no surprise that we're seeing this sort of slow down if some of the workers are actually getting some of the benefits that they've been asking for a day. Yeah, you mentioned that September number. The number in the month of August was the smallest to date under this unionization push just eight. And they have suffered 50 losses that have gone largely unreported. Strange connection I'm going to make here, but bear with me, Rachelle. Remember what happened with Liv Gault? They came on the scene. They really rattled the entire sports world. What happened? Well, the PGA adjusted. They said, okay, we're going to have to up our pay. We're going to have to up our game. We're going to have to add new tournaments. We're going to really change the economic model for the players. And it largely worked and it largely quieted all the effort, all the gains from Liv really, I think, squashed. So I think you see a similar effect here with Starbucks. The unionization effort push was ultimately in the end helpful for these thousands of employees across the country because Starbucks had to respond. They had to do something to improve the conditions. At the year point, the working, the pay, the wages. So they raised the boat. So I think in the end, this was a win. And even if unionization continues to die down across the country, the other factor here to consider is, of course, when we feel like we might be entering a recession with inflation so high, I think you're getting some people eager to hang on to a job and at least bear down for the moment. And it does also show that shift from Starbucks. Because at first, we saw a lot of, perhaps a lot of companies, employees wondering if they're still going to close if they complained. So they tried the stick method. So it's interesting that now they're going with the carrot method. That seems to be much more effective than obviously some of the threats of potentially people losing their jobs or having their stores closed to fix some of these issues. Yeah, that they're, you do hear some say there was a bit of a chilling effect by some of those moves closing some of those stores that were unsafe, also, also unionized, but looks to be a quieting movement. All right, coming up, the midterms just eight days away when survey reveals how many Americans say their finances are worse now than when President Biden was elected and what are the political implications of that? Stick around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,82,2022-10-31 19:44:31
4484,"�리 The midterm elections now less than eight days away and control the U.S. House and Senate is up for grabs. And ominous number for Democrats, 43 percent of Americans see their finances are now worse than when President Biden was elected. That's according to Bank rate. Here to discuss that is Bank rate senior economic analyst Mark Hammrich, Mark Goodesia sir, let's dive inside that number a bit. How does it break down among demographics, generations and political parties? Well, good to see you as well. Generally speaking, younger Americans, and we weren't just surveying voters here, we're really surveying across the landscape of the country. Other Americans tended to be either faring better from their own statements and certainly Democrats were saying that they thought they were faring better than the Republicans were willing to say. So it is quite, I think, interesting here that the polarization that we've seen for a number of years now in our country is representing itself in the way that people are assessing their own personal, financial plights. Mark, I want to ask you about this one statistic. It's 69 percent place, at least a moderate amount of blame on President Biden for their financial situation. And keep in mind, he came in in the middle of a pandemic and then you obviously had Russia and Ukraine as well. But people seem to put the blame obviously more squarely on the president's shoulders. Why do you think that is? Well, I'd say a couple of things about that. Richell and this great to see you again as well. First of all, I think that there is this notion of an all-powerful president that many people have come to espouse whether it's accurate or not. And there is the old saying that I believe was a Harry Truman put into the public's mindset which was the butt stops here. And so we could probably talk for hours about the messaging that this administration has tried to employ with respect to the economy. But many Americans, I do think, are perhaps fixated to some degree on the presidency. And frankly, some lack the nuanced understanding of government and the economy to be able to sort of slice and dice where the blame might actually be cast. The number we put up on you discussed earlier was really my big takeaway from your survey that 56% of younger voters versus the 30 we see there. Why that matters is because who votes more and why does that matter? What are the implications for the midterms for Democrats? Yeah, I don't think it's a good implication for them because the thought has been...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,83,2022-10-31 19:48:53
4485," I, does that matter? What are the implications for the midterms for Democrats? Yeah, I don't think it's a good implication for them because, uh, you know, the thought has been that the turnout in this election will not be, uh, sufficient, uh, to give Democrats the kind of support that they saw in 2020. And as you say, uh, younger voters have tended to be more disengaged in recent years than older voters. So obviously, just like, uh, prognosticators do when they're anticipating the outcome of a big sports contest, we actually get to get through this election to see how it turns out. But, uh, some of the other survey information outside of the survey work that we do, I've seen indicates that broadly speaking, Republicans are seen as, uh, perhaps being more credible with respect to management of the economy than Democrats are, whereas the Democrats are seen sort of, uh, playing strong hands on issues like abortion. And, uh, the student loan forbearance issue and, you know, then the question is, is that enough for them to prevail in the, in the sense of holding on to the House and at least holding onto that tie in the Senate? And I would say that the prospects for that are, but them not good. And, and even looking ahead over the next two years, about one in three people expect their finances to be worse. When you look at what actually is making up the financial picture that they're talking about, what is it that they're holding on with this? Well, we did not question them in this survey about that, but as you know, we survey Americans all the time at bank rate, and so between this survey, other surveys we've done, we know, for example, uh, you know, economically statistically that the excess savings that Americans had amassed during the early year or so of the pandemic, that that excess savings is certainly, uh, dwindling. And inflation is stealing that cash as well as their purchasing power elsewhere. Of course, inflation broadly is clearly the number one issue on consumer minds. And for others, I, I would say that, you know, in us, in some ways, this situation has come for everybody in one form or the other, including those who are wealthy, who by the way, in this survey, those with household incomes of more than 250,000 or more, we really saw a strong showing on their part here saying that their finances were better off. Yet they would be the ones who would tend to have lost the most wealth, even on a percentage basis per household, because they were more exposed to the stock market during this bear market that we've seen. So, I think there's fear. I think there is concern about the persistence and high level of inflation, not to mention the fact that, you know, economists broadly as well as many corporate executives are saying that the risk of recession are quite high getting into 2023. We'll really fascinate them. Look at the psyche of voters and their finances heading into midterms. Mark Hamrick, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, coming up, the investigation into Tevett taking a new turn. Stay with us to find out more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,84,2022-10-31 19:53:05
4486," music Welcome back. The Justice Department is set to take a fresh look at a stalling probe into populist stablecoin, Tevr, this according to fresh reporting from Bloomberg. Other reports suggest the case has been transferred within the department. Now the finances David Polarit has the details, David, what do we know so far? Well, you know, Michelle, there are a lot of questions still that we don't know, but I think what is clear from this is that Tevr has sort of been under a federal probe for some time. And it is actually arranged in terms of what federal investigators have been looking at with the stablecoin issuer. And at this point, it sounds like for the past year, it has been about a question of bank fraud, which is more tied towards 2017 period, in which case, it was about whether or not Tevr was lying to its banking partners. Now the details about what this investigation, the nature of it is telling us is not been revealed, but the interesting thing from the report from the Bloomberg report is that, you know, we've seen this investigation be transferred to Manhattan from a assuming D.C. and that signifies that at such a late point that there might be something else that's going on here that needs to be settled more than likely, though, also this is a part of the DOJ has a new program that they've been trying out, which is sort of a cryptocurrency specialist network, in which case experts can sort of collaborate. And this could be an example of that. That being said, back in February of last year, Tether's affiliate exchange, Bitfinex, paid about $18.5 million to settle claims with the New York attorney. So this could be something like us seeing a specialist for Tether taking on an investigation. The bank fraud charges have not been clearly labeled. So, you know, we do need to see more or hear more from prosecutors about what's going on. So, it looks like more scrutiny ahead. Thank you for that update. I very own Dave Holler if thanks so much.

Finances in S foray to break down the action. See if we can have the best Dow month of my lifetime, E-Nes. Yeah, that's right Dave and Jared did a great job of breaking all that down. But right now for today we're going to end this session pretty much where we started this morning. You've got the Dow down 116 points, the NASDAQ down more than 1% and the S&P 500 down about 29 points. Looking at the 10 year treasury yield, we have been watching this one climb higher today up 7 basis points at 4.08%. Energy today being the leader up 710s of a percent for XLE. Look at the Dow right here, quite a bit of red that we're seeing. And on the NASDAQ 100, a lot of red especially meta down 6% eyeing its lowest close since 2015, here's the closing bell. The stocks ending the day with lots of red across the board. Let's take a deeper dive. But how the major indices did, although all three ended off their session lows. We're going to see the Dow there losing almost half a percent there, the S&P 500 also losing about 3 quarters of a percent there. And the NASDAQ losing more than 1% there, that sort of collective vote of breath back as we await some word from the Fed as their meeting kicks off tomorrow.

So Lisa, I want to first start with you in terms of how you are digesting what's happening in the markets right now as we wait for word from the Fed as well as jobstator coming out this week as well. Well thanks, Rochelle. We're really fairly cautious on the US equity market and really the reason why is we've just got a tough economic environment. We're going to keep among those concerns really is on the inflation front.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,86,2022-10-31 20:02:09
4488," really cautious on the US equity market. And really the reason why is we've just got a tough economic environment. Chief among those concerns really is on the inflation front. So if we think about the price pressures we witnessed in the last several months, what we're seeing is some deceleration in some of the underlying numbers behind the broad inflation, but really the price pressures remain at a fairly high level. And so that is really continuing to lead to really central bank tightening whether it's at the Fed or globally. And that really just is a very tough headwind for companies to overcome. In addition to the fact that they had very strong growth numbers in 2021 coming off the pandemic. So it is even harder for them to sort of lap those comparisons that they had last year. And so growth overall is slowing as well. So Lisa, make sense of the best Dow month of my lifetime. And perhaps the best October ever given the conditions we just laid out. Well, to your point, we've had really some out of a run up in October, but we are having some caution as to whether that really can continue. If you think about the factors that are really driving what happened in October, one is just the fact that we've had earnings expectations come down so low that there really was a lower bar for companies to overcome. And so that presented a little bit of a relief rally. In addition to that, though, I think investors have been hanging on the Fed's every word to look at potentially, again, if they may turn some of that more strict monetary policy. And there were some comments during the month that were interpreted as starting to potentially indicate a pivot. But again, as we look forward, we've seen some of that sides of potential pivot be countered with some more recent hawkish speak. And so again, the overall view is really more cautious. And also Dana, we're seeing that obviously we see the rustle in positive territory unlike the rest of the markets today. What's your take on what we're seeing with small caps and how much they act as an inflation hedge? Now, well, typically small caps actually are a pretty decent inflation hedge. Small value in particular have been able to pass on inflationary costs over time. So we've maintained sort of an interest in diversifying across the spectrum of stocks and small caps in particular. And if you look at empirical evidence on markets over the long haul, small, small value actually does tend to outperform. I won't say, if you're in the smallest growth, the asdare is where you're just this side of profitability, they don't outperform. But small value stocks do tend to outperform the broader market over time. And as we transition now, I think to a more fundamental driven type of a market, we probably see some of that come back with that 10 years of large growth dominating. I think we're seeing that shift now because of interest rate increases in the cost of money increasing. So Lisa, all eyes on the Fed on Wednesday, pretty much baked in 75. I like it this point. And Goldman over the weekend suggests an extra 25. So they've got 75.50. And then two consecutive 25s. What do you expect to hear from Jerome Powell this week and how might markets ingest that? The key question really for everybody with the upcoming Fed meeting is, any kind of indication they're going to give as far as future direction. The markets are really to your point, fairly well settled and expecting 75 basis points for this week. So they're really looking forward as again to that forward trajectory. And we really think it's just unclear which way things will go. Again, the Fed isn't a tough position because they're very data dependent. And it's just unclear how quickly inflation is going to come down. So we are anxiously as well awaiting really what they are going to put forward as far as their language. And again, it just remains to be seen how they're going to position themselves at that meeting. So, Dana, when you look at some of the stickier parts of inflation that are hanging on, that are giving the Fed pause, and for example, what we're seeing with the housing market, what we're seeing with the jobs data as well, how are you positioning yourself? Well, I mean, diversification is the obvious place, right? I would echo what Lisa said. I think the market right now is just waiting good. I think 75 basis points is all but guaranteed. And the question becomes that what point does the Fed pivot? I would say just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,87,2022-10-31 20:06:09
4489," I think 75 basis points is all but guaranteed. And the question becomes, that what point does the Fed pivot? I would say just given the fact that unemployment is sort of remaining resolutely low, it really empowers the Fed to kind of push harder. And that means like we hire likelihood maybe that the Fed put remains sort of inoperable. And if that's the case, if you're thinking in the short term, you're probably thinking toward defensive areas, quality, low volatility, et cetera. If you're positioning yourself for the longer haul, maybe you're buying into areas of the market, again, the smaller value type of stocks where you're getting it at a lower price and perhaps a long run, a higher return. And the safety, Yule, you said the best way to position oneself given the setup you laid out. We're actually focusing on cash flowing investments. So our focus would actually be more so outside of the US equity market and areas like high quality fixed income and global infrastructure. When you have a very difficult economic period really being able to have more of that income up front, we think makes sense. It just cushions your return pattern to a greater degree and provides some ballast to the portfolio. And Dan, I want to ask you because usually in the run-up to some of these Fed decisions, the markets seem to know what's coming. They're expecting the 75 basis point hike. Yet when they hear the words from Powell, then we see the markets become more volatile and they start to sell off again. What are the expectations here? And is this going to happen again, you think? I think we should call it. It's really all about the remarks that he makes around what we're going to expect going forward. So when he says the word 75, that's priced in. The question is, do we start to even see a tapering off a little in December? The market has remained this year from my perspective sort of doggishly devoted to this idea that maybe the Fed will pivot a little quicker than might be anticipated, right? So any sort of dog-ish comments around what's going to happen in December or confirmation of what a lot of market participants now think, which is that once we get into 2023, the Fed will back off, I think, is greeted positively by the markets. I just don't know that I think we should expect that given, again, what we're seeing in inflation, what we're seeing in the unemployment rate, it really does give the Fed that mandate to stay hawkish. So good, very well here. Jerome Powell simply reiterates what he and the other governors have been saying and markets react poorly to that. Indeed, expecting a hawkish tone. All right, thanks so much, Dana Dooria and Lisa Erickson, appreciates both being here.

4490," from you China's zero COVID policies forcing the closure of Disney's Shanghai Resort. Park visitors present at the time of the announcement were required to remain until they returned a negative COVID test. Rising case numbers across China prompted a tightening of local containment policies and lockdowns. We're joined by young finances, Anjali Kamlani for more Anjali. What's the latest? That's right, Richelle. We know now that the guests from that Shanghai Disney location have all been let go and they're now home. That was a result of a quick lockdown, a sudden lockdown at that Disney location. Unclear and wise specifically, though Shanghai itself did record more than 10 locally transmitted asymptomatic cases prior to the weekend. And we of course know that China's zero COVID policy has left a lot of areas with strict compliance and requirements. Disney Park itself did already have pretty stringent requirements for entry, including banning individuals who were in high transmission areas over the last seven days or had traveled abroad within the past seven days. So there was already strict testing as well as sorry, the 72R PCR test, negative PCR test. So all of that had already been in place and still we saw this lockdown. We also know of course that various cities and neighborhoods as well have been locked down in the recent weeks as they see an increase in cases. And we know that that is not just the tale of what's going on in China around the world. We're seeing cases rise with concerning variants in the coming weeks and months. Certainly a variety of ways countries are dealing with this. Anjali Kamlani, thank you so much. Dave. Thanks for shell with lockdowns spreading across China. And many are asking is another COVID wave ahead for the United States over the holidays here to discuss that the RSV outbreak and mental health in the workplace is US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek, Murphy Doctor. Really appreciate you being here on Yahoo Finance. Thanks so much. Mental health really something that matters a lot to me. But let's start with COVID. It's faded from the minds of Americans largely speaking. Where are we in regards to putting it in the rear view mirror in your eyes and what lies ahead you think for the holidays?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,89,2022-10-31 20:14:56
4491," Faded from the minds of Americans largely speaking, where are we in regards to putting it in the rearview mirror in your eyes? And what lies ahead do you think for the holidays? Well, thanks for that question. And it's the right question to ask. And let me put COVID in context for a moment. We have come a certainly a long way over the last two and a half years when it comes to COVID. Or deaths are down more than 90% from their peak. We have our kids back in school learning in person full time. And many people are able to see their families over the holidays and over weekends. This is all good news. But the reason that we have made this progress is because we've had critical tools we've built, namely, life-saving vaccines and life-saving medications. We've also used air filtration masks and other tools to help reduce spread. This is a time when winter approaches that we've got to keep that in mind because each of the last two winners we've seen cases rise. And so if you haven't gotten an updated vaccine yet, it's important to do that and anyone's five and up is eligible, who's more than two months after out from their last shot. It's also important if you do get COVID, whether you're vaccinated or not, that you reach for treatments, that you talk to your doctor, especially if you're older, above 65 or if you have other medical conditions, because those treatments could save your life. We're also battling what some are calling the triple-demick COVID RSV and flu. It's a buzzworthy media term, but how concerned is the administration about that possibility? Well, we're certainly working very closely on these viruses. We know that one COVID certainly has spread in the winter, is where already seeing flu moving up quickly. In fact, earlier than it typically does in RSV as well, you know, is affecting a significant number of children, and is in fact filling up hospital ERs in many parts of the country. And there are other viruses circulating as well. You'll see this in the fall. We're seeing it a bit earlier for some of these viruses in typical. And, you know, for me, this experience is personally just last week. I had to take my daughter into the emergency room, because she was infected with one of these respiratory viruses. She's four years old and was having difficulty breathing. So I know what it feels like to be apparent in that circumstance. But here's a good news. When it comes to COVID itself, there are vaccines available for children six months of old and up. They can reduce your chances of your child ending up severely ill. And God forbid losing their life. When it comes to the flu, which is also an issue now, there are vaccines available there too for kids six months and up as well as treatments if your child does get the flu. And with RSV, it turns out there, some of the basic precautions we've been talking about for respiratory viruses are more important than ever. Staying away from folks who may be sick, staying home if you're sick yourself, making sure you're washing your hands. These are all measures that we can take to help protect ourselves from RSV and other circulating viruses. Hope your daughter's doing better. Was there something about COVID that changed our perception or that made our immune systems more broken down and susceptible to flu and RSV? Well, that's a good question. It's certainly a lot changed in the last couple of years in terms of our behavior patterns and that impacted what we were exposed to. But we fully, and you see when you look around the world at the pattern with which these viruses are now coming back, it is varying. I think they expect we'll settle into some sort of equilibrium here. But the bottom line is what has been shown time and time again, is that when we use vaccines and the appropriate way when we stay up to date with our vaccines, those dramatically reduce our chances of getting severely ill. And Dave, one thing I just want to underscore here is what the purpose of vaccines are. Many people say, hey, I got vaccinated, but I still got infected. Does that mean the vaccines don't work? Well, the goal of the vaccine, the most important goal is to save your life. And by that measure, the data, now from hundreds of millions of people who've gotten vaccinated for COVID, by telling us that the vaccines are working to save people's lives, we just need to make sure people are up to date with them. Because if you're under vaccinated or unvaccinated, that's when you're risk of complications and death increases. Important message. Now, one might argue that an even bigger epidemic is upon us regarding our mental health. And that's why you've rolled out a framework for workplace mental health and well-being in some staggering numbers in there, Dr. 76% of US workers reported at least one symptom of depression or anxiety. That's up 17% in just two years. Why did the pandemic have such a negative impact on our mental health? Well, David, thank you for asking. This is one of the great concerns I have about our country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,90,2022-10-31 20:19:10
4492," Why did the pandemic have such a negative impact on our mental health? Well, David, thank you for asking. This is one of the great concerns I have about our country now and going forward is how do we address the mental health crisis that is impacting so many America's particularly young people. And I think a couple of things that are worth saying here, when it comes to COVID itself, COVID added so much strain to people's lives. Not only were people worried about their health and the health of their loved ones, but their lives were turned upside down, especially in the early days of the pandemic. So I had so important that we worked hard to get our kids back to school and give people the opportunity to see their loved ones again. That's an important part of your mental health and wellbeing. But the workplaces worth focusing on in particular, because keep in mind, people who are working full time spend, you know, close to half of their waking hours at work. And your work affects your mental health, but it also turns out that the mental health of workers impacts an organization. It impacts their productivity of workers and impacts creativity. It impacts retention. So the reason I issued a certain general's framework on workplace mental health and wellbeing is to lay out five key essentials that organizations can use to build a foundation for mental health, which will not only help workers, but keep in mind what helped the bottom line and the longevity of organizations themselves. So what's the most important thing employers can do? And how does remote work impact that? Yeah, so the most important thing that employers can do is to bring workers into the conversation about how to improve mental health, bring them to the table and make sure that their voice is helping shape your approach to mental health and wellbeing. You can take the framework that we put forward and use it to begin that conversation by asking workers how the organization is doing on those five fronts. And those five essentials, by the way, include protection from harm. That's a physical and psychological harm. A second involved building connection and community at work, third work life harmony, fourth ensuring that people know that they are valued, that they matter at work, and fifth, making sure that people have opportunities for growth. You know, we recognize some companies are doing great in some of those areas. In other areas, they have areas to improve. We wanted to put this framework forward so people knew what that roadmap was because now more than ever, we've got to invest in mental health for the sake of individuals, organizations and societies a whole. Means a lot. I wear my mental health struggles in the past as a badge of honor. I have suffered from depression and anxiety most days quite frankly. How do we address the stigma that's attached to mental health in the workplace? And is there any way to address affordability and access? Well, they first thank you for your courage in sending up and sharing your own story. I say that is somebody who not only cares about this, but has struggled myself with mental health concerns over the years, especially when I was a child. And look, I think the way we address the stigma, it starts with people stepping up and sharing their stories. It starts with leaders and organizations helping people understand not just in words, but in deeds that we're going to support people with their mental health and wellbeing. Look, if somebody fractured their leg and needed to be out for few days for surgery and recovery, we would say that's seen perfectly understandable in the workplace. Yet too many workers do not feel comfortable. They're having a mental health crisis saying, you know what, I need a little bit of time to go see it therapist to get some help. We have to change that and leaders can change that again, but with the force of their example. And finally, just keep this in mind as well. At the time where I know workplaces are feeling like they have a lot on their place, a lot they have to deal with. It's important that we recognize that mental health is really when we invest in it in the workplace, it's a win-win for both workers and for the workplace in a short and long term. But also a lot of these measures that we're talking about in the framework I put forward, they don't require heavy capital investment. Sure, there are some areas like providing paid leave to employees, ensuring that they have adequate time off to rest. These may require some investment of time, but when it comes to building an environment where people can come to know one another, building a culture of gratitude and appreciation, ensuring that people know that they are valued and ensuring that there's a bound to be in work and non-work time that's respected, these are things that we can do with little capital investment, but they return huge dividends. Really appreciate what you're doing on mental health in the workplace. One tip on addressing the triple-demick in the workplace, see this pocket square? It's actually a mask. See that?

4493," On tip on addressing the triple dynamic in the workplace, see this pocket square? It's actually a mask. See that we can encourage that. And boom, what do you think doc? Well listen, I'm glad you brought it up because one thing that we have learned is that masks are an effective tool at reducing the risk of spreading, not just COVID, but other viruses as well. So particularly for those who are at higher risk or if you're living with somebody at higher risk, during this time when there are a lot of respiratory virus is circulating, using that mask and being effective way to reduce the risk to you and the people around you. And a way to stay in style. US Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, great to have you, sir. Really appreciate the time. Thanks so much Dave. Great to be with you today. All right, good to see you.

Now here's that look inside the NASDAQ where we see some halves and halves not. Have nuts, apple up 11%, Tesla down 14%, Amazon down 9%, Nvidia up 11%, and one of the standouts here, the big one, meta down 31% for the month. And that is down about 75% from its high. And I just want to show you the leaders as well because here we're seeing some more halves and at least one have not. They have not, K-web, China. That is its own story that has to do with President-G assuming that unprecedented third term as a premier or as the prime minister over there. In the forefront, we have MJ. That is a cannabis ETF.

We see some of the smaller ones like diamond back resources. That's up 30%, Devon resources, that's up 28%. And look at the banking sector, not as big a number as but still impressive. We got a number of earnings beats here and also a couple of some source buys here but JP Morgan's still up more than 20% bank America right behind it. Goldman stacks up over 17%. And as I like to do, I'm just gonna end on travel here and we're seeing for the most part except for this Chinese.trip.com that's down 17% some big gains. Royal Caribbean up 40%, United up 32%.

It's a seasonality play but whenever we have huge October's a lot of times we take a little bit of a backstop in November. So lots to unpack here. Overall a slightly bullish tilt, Richelle to the markets. Indeed, but obviously no match for your very fine pocket square that I noticed you did at our very own. Thank you. Thank you for reporting there. Thank you, Dave. Nicely done. Well let's take a look at what's happening with wheat futures. They're off to the races. They're up almost 6% today as Russell withdraws from the Black Sea grain export steel. Now the finances Rick Newman has been following this story so Rick, where do things stand right now? So let's back up and review why Russia is getting out of this deal. Ukraine apparently used some naval drones to attack some ships at Russia's big port in Crimea where their Black Sea fleet is headquartered. So pulling out of this deal to allow the range shipments out of Ukraine's Black Sea coast that is supposedly retaliation. Because I guess Russia thinks that even though they are trying to obliterate Russia's power sector with daily missile barrages, Russia's Ukraine should not be allowed to retaliate on their ships that are launching some of those missiles. So this is escalating beyond the battlefield. I mean, this is clearly what you would call a full on hybrid war now between, it's really not just between Russia and Ukraine. It's between Russia and Ukraine and Ukraine's allies and then third parties such as countries in Africa in the Middle East that need the grain and other food products coming out of Ukraine. So this is just continues to be a complete mess. And the latest thing I saw in this guys was, Ukraine is now saying that Russia has actually fired that Russian naval warships have fired on some tugboats that were escorting green barges, or tugging grain barges out of Ukraine through the Black Sea. And there may be some casualties associated with that. So I saw that on social media just a few minutes ago, we'll see if that pans out. But in addition to the shooting war, we have an energy war, we have a food war, and we probably have other types of wars that Russia is planning at this point as well. Rick, can you quantify just how significant a move it would be in terms of the grain exports from Ukraine? How significant would a blockage of that be? And this just your opinion, your guess, would this prompt US or UN action? Probably not, probably not prompt UN action, or it wouldn't be US, it would be NATO action. I'm in the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,93,2022-10-31 20:32:11
4495, action probably not it would probably not prompt you in action or or Nate wouldn't be us it would be NATO action yeah and the I mean the reason I say that is because we've already been through this drill and there what and the action would be things such as NATO escorts for grand ships coming out of the black sea so we were at that decision point before and it did not happen so I mean if this were to become a dire starvation level issue maybe that would change and that could happen but just to to go back to your question about context and how much does this matter you you crane is a major source of several types of food products including things like sunflower oil called that cooking oil a grain other types of grown products and because we have a type food markets in some parts of the world you know marginal changes in supply can make a big difference so we're talking about difficulty getting food in some parts of Africa in the Middle East so I think it depends how long this would go on and this gets more complicated it gets into will insurers cover the ships they're carrying the grain if they're concerned that Russian warships might shoot at them probably not so Russia can do harm just by making threats because then those ships can't sail so we're going to have just a complete mess of a war in many different varieties through the winter and for many months to come indeed we know that food scarcity can lead to more conflict so certainly don't want to see more of that as well Rick Newman thank you so much all right coming up rising mortgage prices are shaking up the housing market a broker tells us what changes she's seeing from buyers and sellers when we come back so so rising rates have led to tough times in the half,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,94,2022-10-31 20:36:29
4496," Rising rates have led to tough times in the housing market, both buyers and sellers stuck on the sidelines with the 30-year fixed north of 7 percent for the first time in 20 years. There are some exceptions to the rule, however. Alyssa Helmut is a broker for my Southern View. Alyssa nice to see you. So the Wall Street Journal, Emerging Markets Index, lists Johnson City, Tennessee. I feel like I should sing it every time, thanks to Derrius Rucker. That's number one on the list ahead of Vesalia, California, Elkord, Indiana, North Port Florida, Fort Wayne, Indiana, round up the top five in Yorktown, Raleigh, North Carolina, Crack in the Top 10. What do these cities have in common in terms of real estate markets? Absolutely. So I think the biggest thing that you're seeing with rising rates is affordability has gone dramatically down. So when you look at markets like Johnson City, like Brawley, the one thing that a lot of those places have in common is you can still find affordable homes and compete in a way that a lot of these really competitive markets such as San Francisco, Chicago, places where buyers were really priced out, they can still with higher interest rates compete and afford in some place like Johnson City or Brawley. Now it's interesting because Alyssa, we know a lot of people move to suburbs, they move to other areas for affordability reasons when they were able to work remotely because of the pandemic, but do you think that's going to be the case now as employers put more pressure on some workers to return to the office? I do. I actually have seen 2021 and 2022 both were years where I saw a dramatic influx of relocation buyers coming to Raleigh, not unlike many of the other markets that you guys mentioned, but part of that was getting priced out in these bigger markets. Right now, when you look at interest rates, you're talking about the average 30 year fixed being 7%. That means that 85% of current homeowners have a lower rate. And so it doesn't make a lot of sense for those folks to move. So when you start looking at affordability, how can I afford my next place? Where do I want to be for five, 10 years? A lot of those other markets are really coming into play and coming into the conversation where folks are saying, maybe I want to be closer to family. Maybe I want to be somewhere else where my paycheck isn't stretched as thin as it is in other markets. In particular, those first time buyers who really been priced out, I think those are the ones you're finding in that top 10 list. So let's talk about the underlying issue here, which of course mortgage rates continue to get worse. If you can put in context, what a mortgage rate means when it's north of 7% in terms of how much more an average monthly payment has gone up. And if I can tack on to that, how high do you expect rates to get in the next six months? Yeah. So I'll answer the second part of that first because I think it's the less scary answer, I guess. My attitude is I think we've probably seen interest rates peak. I think that they've risen dramatically in the last six months and in a way that really wasn't predicted. The other element to that is we got pretty spoiled. Rates being lower than 4% for long periods of time, which we saw in 2020, 2021, a good portion of 2022. That's not the norm. It's not normal to see rates. It wasn't that long ago that I was closing homes at 2.75 or 3%. Those are dramatically low, low rates when you look at the history of where rates have been. So I do think that we've probably capped out where we're going to be. I don't think that we'll see a decrease back down to that necessarily 3% or 2.5% even, but I do think that we'll start to see a leveling off. The first part of your question, though, is a big change. Homeowners are paying dramatically more just based on interest rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,95,2022-10-31 20:40:43
4497," off. Um, the first part of your question though, it's, it's a big change. Um, homeowners are paying dramatically more just based on interest rates. What I'm having to have a conversation, especially with a lot of first time home buyers about is if they got approved with a rate at three and a half, four percent, I'm having to say to them, you really need to speak to the lender again, before we go ahead and write an offer because rates have risen so much that it's actually priced some first time home buyers and some, um, just in general buyers, uh, completely out of the price point they were looking. So they're having to just adjust the price point altogether. And I want to ask you about the inventory picture because obviously if you're a homeowner and you're seeing with these mortgage rates ahead and you, you want to sort of sit tight, enjoy your equity or perhaps, you know, wait till the market's frothy again. What is the expectations for inventory given the slow pace and the lack of confidence we've been seeing from home builders? Yeah, I actually think that's had a lot to do with this slowdown. Um, it's less about rates and more about, um, where a lot of sellers are. We had a, um, insanely low inventory, especially in Raleigh for years, um, due to the feeding frenzy that these low, low rates were causing. Um, people were saying I'm not going to move because I don't know if I can compete in this craziness that the market is. Now you're seeing people saying rates have gone so high. I'm locked in it three and a half percent or four percent. Why would I go out and upsize or downsize and be in a mortgage that's going to be more expensive at that rate? So I think you're seeing a lot of sellers stay put. But that said, real estate is one of those basic human needs that is always going to function. So even in, you know, the recession of 2009, you saw people buying and selling homes. It still happens. We're still seeing need-based moves. We're still seeing people out there saying, Hey, now that there's a little fewer buyers out there, maybe I can actually compete. Maybe I'm up against less competition. So there's some really good opportunities. If you can find the right mortgage rate, the other element to that that I think is really important is we're so used to saying, Okay, I'm closing on this house. I've gotten my mortgage and now I can forget about mortgage rates until I'm ready to buy again. That's not what we're advising anybody to do now. Instead, I'm saying go ahead, find the lowest rate that you can. But once you've bought, keep your eye on rates. When you see them start to decrease, look at refinancing and save yourself some money there just because you buy at the rate at a current rate right now. Doesn't mean that that's the rate that you have to stay at throughout the course of you owning that home. Refines of all, but disappeared at the moment. Alyssa Helmer, nice to see you. Thanks so much. Coming up, the oil industry has not met its commitment to the American people. These are the words of President Biden as he addresses high oil prices and corporate profits as the mid-term loom.

Let me know which machine to do with this machine. Oil trading lower this afternoon on concerns over demand from China. On the domestic front, President Biden has accused the oil industry of not meeting its commitment to the American people. His comments renew his attack on the oil majors, saying the profiteering needs to end. It comes as the midterms draw ever closer and with Americans still paying more at the pump than this time last year. Biden has slammed the likes of Exxon, Mobile and Chevron for not raising production as profits boom, though fresh data shows US output jumping to pre-pandemic levels. Lots of strands to join together there. We're joined by Claudio Gallimberti, Rice Dad Energy Senior VP of Analysis and Oil. Thank you for joining us today. We do keep hearing this conflation about oil profits and what that means, whether you can pause those on to the actual consumer at the end of the day when it comes to gas prices. What do people need to understand about this picture? Well, thank you for inviting me. When it comes to the high profit of the oil industry, we need to remind ourselves where we were just two or three years ago when the situation was completely opposite to oil prices at some point in time in 2020 were negative. So we need to put these things into perspective and realize that everything needs to be seen from the perspective of what's the average in the past four or five years. Currently, obviously, profits are really high. And the expectation is for the oil producer to produce more. But this comes another twist, which is you cannot just turn the top on and immediately have more oil. So the oil investment like cycle take years. So it's understandable that the public, the administration is frustrated, but this situation is years in the making and cannot be solved in just one or two months. Yeah, and the president's saying today that these record profits are a quote, windfall of war. We are just a couple of days out, I guess, less than eight days from the midterms. And we all know control the Senate and the House remains up for grabs. And no chance, frankly, that the Democrats hold onto both. So is this a serious policy proposal? Well, I'd say we are really close to the midterms. So it's really all everything can work in a sense, right? So they're trying their best to grab as many votes as possible. I don't think that putting a windfall tax on oil companies right now will generate more supply in the future. So this is a simple math and simple economics if you want as a matter of fact, if you want more oil, probably you need to consider to do the opposite. It is counterintuitive. It might sound very unpopular, but these are clearly the laws of supply and demand in economics. So when he comes...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NpLu_aghw,97,2022-10-31 20:49:36
4499," positive. It is counterintuitive. It might sound very unpopular, but these are clearly the laws of or supply and demand and economics. So when it comes to the midterms, it's clear that this could be a kind of a last-ditch move from the current administration to try and gather as many votes as possible. But in terms of policy proposal, I don't think it goes into the right direction, frankly, because yes, Biden said we need more oil. You don't get more oil if you surtax the companies. So what is the solution here? Obviously, the blame game isn't helping bring prices down and Biden is accusing all companies of not investing in the US, but at the same time, he's also trying to push for clean energy. What is the actual solution here? The solution has to be taken with the long-term into perspective. So first of all, the energy crisis was not borne out of the invasion of Ukraine, so it was a long, long way coming. We were already in an oil and energy crisis before the invasion of Ukraine and what the invasion did was to heighten things that were already brood in the background, which is too little supply against the demand that after the pandemic was growing really, really strong. I'm talking both about oil and gas, but specifically oil. So what needs to be done is a situation in which the administration says that at least for the time being, even if they ran on a green, put on poor green ticket, the reason they need for more votes of fuel. And these fossil fuel are going to solve the current crisis, the current energy crisis. But even with that in mind, it may take quite a few quarters. For instance, the oil production in the United States was supposed to grow right now. We were supposed to be producing more that we currently do. And that's due to the supply chain issue. So even if you are in a situation where the regulators is supportive and so far the regulator has not been that supportive, you may still encounter supply chain issues. And this is what the situation will currently in. On top of that, of course, we are in the international arena, if you would, OPEC class decided to cut their production in order to support prices. Therefore, I mean, that's the current situation. So it's very tough for just one government to wish the oil prices lower. It requires much more than that. And on top of it, we're nearing 12 million barrels per day in August, which is near the pre-pandemic eye of 13 million undercutting a bit of that argument. Our thanks to Claudio Gallemberte, Riceat Energy, Senior VP of Analysis, and oil. Appreciate that. Let's take a look at what's trending after hours. IMAX shares under pressure after company reporting. Look at that down about 6% after hours reporting revenue for the third quarter in line with analysts' expectations. But it's lost widened from a year ago. The company's seeing revenue come at at $68.8 million. That's up 21% year over year. IMAX's gross box office increased 25% year over year to 177.1 million with 30% of the box office coming from local language blockbusters. On the flip side, Avis budget group shares rising just less than 3% after hours. After an earnings beat, the company posting earnings per share of 2170, handily beating the estimate of $14.17, Avis's revenue narrowly beat estimates as well, coming in at $3.55 billion, $3.55 billion. Chief Executive Joe Ferraro noting his company is seeing increased demand in both the commercial and the leisure segments. He adds the outlook for the holiday season remains optimistic. Rounding things out, good-year tire shares are trading lower after reporting third quarter earnings. Good-year tire missed out on adjusted EPS. The company reporting 40 cents versus an estimate of 56 cents. Quarterly sales of 5.31 billion, which beat the analyst's consensus estimate of 5.29 billion. The company expects raw material cost up about $500 million in the fourth quarter.

Now, the right-hailing giant is reporting earnings ahead of the open tomorrow. Revenue is expected to show a 70% gain from a year ago with losses narrowing. And while the ride sharing part of the business is rebounding, the company's food delivery business is expected to show slower growth after the pandemic fueled boom. And lists are watching the food delivery business closely, not just for Uber, but for its rivals, including DoorDash. That stock hitting an all-time low today ahead of its earnings report on Thursday. Be keeping an eye on those for you.

4505," ==== Gate ==== Shares of Uber are leaping higher this morning by 16% after revenue jumped 72% year of year. EBITDA came in higher than projected as well. Wedbush Security is managing director and senior analyst Dan Ives joins us with more on Uber's numbers. Dan, it's great to see you. First of all, the company predicted that bookings are going to continue to expand in the fourth quarter. What we've been talking about and what we're really curious about, is there any sign of pushback on pricing from Uber, which has gotten a little bit higher here. We're not seeing the same level of promotioning that we were. Yeah, I think that's an important dynamic. I mean, we're not seeing as much promotion driver shortages or in the rearview mirror. And really what's happening is that consumers are really starting to accept those higher price points. That's important for anyone that's seen peak rides in major cities, mean price points are up significantly. This is a tailwind for Uber. And I think in terms of that, God, and this is a shock to the upside. I mean, street was skeptical going in. And I think this is Dara and Uber flex their muscles coming out of the pandemic. Dan, if they're flexing their muscles, what does this mean for Lyft? Because I think we've learned maybe in the second quarter, Uber is doing so well right now that may be coming at the expense of Lyft. Well, Lyft continues to be the little brother to Uber. And I think that's been an issue for them, promotional activities continue increased. And remember, Uber has the global platform. Lyft continues to be domestic. Now, in theory, this bogewell for Lyft, but that's when they continue to trip over their shoelaces in next week's and important earnings for them to really prove it after it's been a choppy road. Of course, there's a lot of attention on the mobile and delivery. But some of the new tests that we're seeing Uber roll out might suggest that they're interested in getting more into the ad space. And some users saying push notifications for other companies via Uber, what type of net add on could this mean for Uber? And is that something that customers have even been asking for? Yeah, I think Brad speaks to like any of these global platforms, the advertising is going to be an opportunity. And I think that's something under the radar, Uber is going to further and further build this. They're going to control the software and the ecosystem, which is positive not just for the company, but even for drivers down the road. And look, they're trying to walk a tight balance here because drivers need to be happy on the platform. Obviously, the labor law in terms of the Department of Labor employee contractor issue. So Uber.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,1,2022-11-01 13:48:47
4506," high balance here because drivers need to be happy on the platform obviously to labor law in terms of department labor and employee contractor issue. So Uber knows that that's in the background have to continue sort of increase the monetization of the platform and let drivers make as much money as they can. Let's talk about that department labor issue for just a moment, right? Do we get any commentary about that from the company and how are you modeling that? How likely do you think that there'll be some changes on the regulatory front? Yeah, look, it's a big issue. Now, not as owners as we'll see the Prop 22 issue in California that ultimately went, you know, Uber and Lyft's way, but this is an issue. I mean, coming from the beltway on the federal side, but I do believe the bar is a little worse than the bite. I think Uber and Lyft there are some ways around this in terms of the contractor employee issue. If ultimately, if drivers are able to see where the rides are picking up and where they're going, gives them more flexibility. And some of these are sort of loopholes that I think Uber is getting ready for because instead of battling this all out and for it, I think there are some business model changes, slight, which could ultimately get around this. And this is going to be playing out for next 12 to 18 months, but so far, Barx worse than the bite. Dan, while we have you here, you're a big name, big presence on Twitter. How much would you pay to keep your checkmark and use Twitter each month? Okay, I think we can talk about the $20. I think in some, you know, obviously many have come out to beating that. I mean, I think it's a smart move, right? And in terms of the monetization of Twitter, and even if you get a subset of that that ultimately came with that blue checkmark, it just starts to move this forward in what's been a treadmill platform in terms of Twitter. From monetization perspective for the last five to six years. Dan, we were talking earlier with Lauren Goodwin of New York Life, and particularly about some portfolios that have shifted purely defensive, but in tech, do you believe that we've started to see some of the bottoms be set in, or is there still more room to the downside that bar should be whereup? I personally believe the bottoms in the rearview mirror attack. I think numbers have been cleared, decks have been cleared in terms of numbers. I think a lot of portfolios are positioned very underweight pack. And I think as we go into early 2023, even if there's a slight pivot from a Fed perspective, I think tech ripped higher. And I think it's the most negative I've seen investors go back 2008. And so far, this earnings season, despite last week on large cap, which was generally a hard show, especially with meta and Zuckerberg in the head striker moment, it's not been as bad as feared. And I know you're looking at the particulars for these companies, Dan, but you've got to think that higher interest rates is going to continue to be challenging, at least perception wise, for many of these companies. Oh, no doubt. Look, obviously, raising capital is almost becoming possible now. And this is all just pen year driven, right? The yield that continues to be arbitration on tech stocks. But I do believe relative to where the valuations are, what growth looks like going into next year. And now, as they start to sort of come out of this as we go into the look on the other side, the economic storm, I think a lot of these companies are going to be better positioned than they were, even pre sort of economic storm. But it's going to, it's not all going to be treated the same, right? If you even if you look at last week, you got Apple, then you compare that to meta. So those are going in a totally different direction. So I do think, Julie, it's going to be more of a bivocation of tech, rather than all goes down or all goes up. And I think that's where starting to see play out during the earnings season. See how goes, Dan, good to see you. Ed Bush, minister and director and see your equity analyst always good to get some time with you. Well, coming up despite housing market flowdown, Saas has got a hot take on home depot. I wonder if the Trek's report is shaking his face.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,2,2022-11-01 13:52:45
4507," Music Music Music Nice. With the housing market slowdown and 30 year mortgage rate over 7%, Sasi, Shun Light on an interesting meeting between city analysts and the management team at Home Depot, including the Museo, the appropriately named headdecker. We didn't say it was Ted Trex. It's Ted Decker in this case. Ted Decker. Now this note by the team over at City, Steven Sacon is a lead analyst. I really caught my attention because of how absolutely bullish it was, just given everything we've seen like Julie mentioned on rates and the housing market slowdown. A couple of reasons why just this really meet distilling some of the notes or tea takeaways from this note from Steven. Home Depot really seeing home price appreciation over the past decade as a key driver of its business. Old homes, older homes or just old stocks in the US means the potential for more remodeling as these homes get sold. Low housing inventory suggests more supplies needed to build more homes in this country. And lastly, opportunity to get more business from contractors. This is an area of Home Depot's business, a growing and always been a very important part of their business, especially relative to lows, which has started to make a lot of enrollments into the pro business. Looking at Steven's analysis and ratings here, he has a buy rating on Home Depot, $340 price target on the company and he has a neutral rating on lows. But look, I think my take is this. And it fits into what we heard from Trex today and a lot of the suppliers like we've talked about, Home Depot stock is down 30% this year for reason. In the area of the Home Depot apron, very, very cool. I really dig that one. Home Depot is one of my favorite stores. But rates are higher, how home sales have slowed, people are pulling back on remodeling activity, we saw in a whirlpool, we saw it in Gen. Rack and we certainly saw it within Trex today. Well, it also comes back to sourcing materials and being able to get the necessary materials to actually get the products developed that come into the store. And that's a byproduct of all of the relationships that they have with suppliers as well. And so, from the supplier part, getting materials and then from the different manufacturers of those products that go into...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,3,2022-11-01 13:57:20
4508," of the relationships that they have with suppliers as well. And so from the supplier part, getting materials, and then from the different manufacturers of those products that go into a home depot store, then it comes down to the contracts that they're able to get to actually push that product through to so many of the contractors that they work with. Yeah, you know, this, what we're seeing right now with Home Depot, took you back to us and analysts actually covering Home Depot during the great financial crisis. And what I underestimated and do not properly account for is when the housing market really starts to turn in a negative a way, it will take a couple quarters for it to show up and Home Depot's results. So you could week be having this conversation in the middle of next year and maybe Home Depot sales are slightly only increasing in terms of same store sales or just flat out falling. Not talking about crashing sales, but again, not the Home Depot and even lows that we have become known for. We have been seeing the past two to three years. All right, well, quickly what I mentioned in the economic data that we got in the past few minutes and that's the PMI, the purchasing managers index from S&P, global to the final read for October, coming in at 50.4 versus the 49.9 that was estimated. So in other words, expansion, an unexpected expansion in that number. We're gonna be getting the ISM read on that in just a moment. Coming up on the other side of the short break, we've got some breaking economic data on Java, job openings on the other side. And ISM. And ISM. Foto. Foto, that's the same feeling. Yeah. Good night. Welcome back to Yall Finance. I'm Brian Saisi here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Another earnings heavy morning with the likes of Pfizer, so fine Uber giving up beat outlooks. All three major industries are in the green right now following some of those better than expected earnings reports. But Julie now let's let's start on some breaking news on the jobs front. Yeah bad news for the Fed job openings in the US to 10.72 million in September. That's it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,4,2022-11-01 14:01:56
4509," expected earnings reports. But Julie, now let's let's start on some breaking news on the jobs front. Yeah, bad news for the Fed job openings in the US to 10.72 million in September. That's an increase from 10.28 million and it's higher than about the 9.75 million that economists had been estimating. Why is that bad news for the Fed? They have been trying to put their foot on the break pedal. Slow down the US economy to such an extent that inflation will fall. They do not want this hugely expansive job market that we have seen and of course we're getting another read on this on Friday. When we get the monthly jobs reports, so not only that, we also just got the ISM manufacturing survey 50.2 50.2 was the reading there. That's two tenths of a percentage point better than estimated prices paid though. Here's a little glimmer of hope. Prices paid in the ISM manufacturing report 46.6. So below that 50 measure and much better than estimated also below what it was the month before New orders ticking up a little bit to 49.2 in that report. An employment ticking up as well. So on balance what is perhaps good news for the economy is perhaps bad news for the interest rate outlook. Yeah, and one huge thing, especially as you were mentioning employment that sticks out to me a moment ago as we were thinking about where the key areas are for us going into this monthly jobs report on Friday to keep a close eye on where we were still seeing some actual tick higher in notable job gains and leisure and hospitality and health care. Where the other sectors are, where that starts to edge lower here as we've started to see some companies have inclination to actually pull some jobs off the table or more massively as we've heard right now in some of the hiring freezes. That largely shows up more in the Joltz data. And so it's going to be interesting week for employment more broadly as a whole as we get some of that preliminary data kind of coming into the big cajona of the mall if you will on Friday with the monthly jobs reporting employment situation. Yeah, it was just interesting, Julie. As soon as you were reporting the Joltz data, you saw the market really tick lower. So you almost have to, I think, be rooting for a not so good jobs report on Friday. But this data would suggest that data or that jobs report might come in pretty strong again. Yeah, it could do, which again, we might not see a positive market reaction to your point. Absolutely. Taking a look at the markets here as, well, they're holding on to gains right now early on today's session. Shifting gears here are just briefly the three ships, three ships left Ukrainian ports under the Black Sea grain export deal today. And the second day of sailings after Russia suspended its participation, that's according to the initiatives United Nations led coordination center. The bottleneck of ships waiting for Russian inspection, easing now that it is out of the operation. But the big question is, will that boost in grain flow hold? The tech forum finds president, tech forum funds president and CEO Sal Grivarty joins us now. Sal, great to speak with you as always. First and foremost, just a huge view of what's going on there. What is the need to know about the situation? Well, I think what people need to know is Russia pulling out, actually, as you just mentioned, Brad, a sped up delivery. Yesterday, you had more ships and more grain tonnage basis, leave Ukrainian ports than since the agreement started. So Russia was slowing things down, perhaps intentionally or not. But they were an impediment to grains flowing more freely. They are now flowing freely. You've got a lot of ships there trying to get out. They are loaded. You're going to see a burst of exports coming from Ukraine, which is much needed. Ukraine is well ahead of their corn export pace from last year, which is interesting. They're behind, but catching up on their wheat export pace. And you'll see a lot of ships leave there in the next several days. What moves forward is going to be tough. With Russia pulling out of the agreement, it runs a lot of risk. It's a wartime area. You will see insurance rates go up. You'll see shipping rates go up. You may see people avoiding sending their ships back into Ukraine to pick up more grain. That will be a problem. That said, Russia has got plenty of grain. You just have to go a little bit east in the Black Sea and you get the Russian ports. And you can pick up all the grain you want, but there are payment problems there. People are afraid to get into the payment system with Russia. There's a big slowdown. And people are afraid their money will be inadvertently frozen. So it's not illegal to buy grain or fertilizer from Russia. But people are afraid to do...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,5,2022-11-01 14:05:46
4510," with Russia, there's a big slowdown, and people are afraid their money will be inadvertently frozen. So it's not illegal to buy grain or fertilizer from Russia, but people are afraid to do it. It's now their supplier of last choice, yet they are the world's largest holder of exportable supplies of both wheat and fertilizers. So talk to us out on balance, and hi, by the way, on balance, what is the supply demand equation look like as we go in, and particularly the supply, look like as we go into the winter here, it sounds like still relatively well supplied, even with these threats from Russia. That's right. We are well supplied, but understand the global balance sheets are tightening. I think we've said this before, and we've got confirmation from the USDA in their October report that this will be another year where the world produces a record amount of wheat, yet we also will use more than we produce. So if you let that sink in, producing a record amount, yet it's not enough. That means global balance sheets over time are tightening, and the big issue for wheat is that if wheat backs up in Ukraine, if ships don't go back in there because we're in a wartime environment, and Russia's pulled out of the deal, there's too much uncertainty now for ship owners and traders to go back in there. If we're in a wartime environment, and people aren't buying from Ukraine or from Russia for that matter, if they're the sources of last resort, which they will be because of the risks involved in sending ships into the Black Sea, what you're going to do is back up supplies that are sitting there, and you can only hold wheat for so long. It'll go bad. Farmers have already planted this year's crop. They plant in the fall, this winter wheat, but apparently Ukraine has planted 40 percent less. Russia probably has another record planting. But if we don't pull the wheat out of there in the next, say, six months to nine months, next year, when they go to plant, they may not plant as much. And with the global balance sheet tightening to have reduced wheat plant things is going to be a major problem moving forward next year to two or three. So I'll give in this environment, what's the read through to consumer prices? I think that, again, we've spoken about this before. Energy has a bigger effect on your box of cereal, say, than does the actual price of the grain. But I think in terms of overall consumer prices, you've got a floor on the wholesale price of grain. The cost of production is higher. And right now, there's too much uncertainty in the world and too much of a tightening balance sheet for grains to go back to their old levels that we saw, say, two years ago, where we were at cost of production. You've got an underlying floor on grains. And China appears to be short food. They're importing. They're buying. They're selling wheat out of their stocks. And sometimes they only sell certain percentage. They sold 100 percent of that wheat this week that they offered. That may be locking their people down because of commodity, particularly food shortages in different areas. It could be a problem. So between China and the supply issues and risk issues in the Black Sea and China's demand, global supplies of grain are going to continue to tighten in the future here. To create on funds, President and CEO, Sal Gilbert, thanks so much as always for that inside and perspective, Sal. Appreciate it. Pleasure. Everyone, shifting gears and taking a look at the major averages here as we are about 38 minutes into today's trading session. Let me pop out of there real quick and give it on us over to the U.S. major averages. The Dow Jones industrial average is actually slipped into negative territory. That's now down by about a quarter of a percent. And we'll take a look at the intraday chart here. There you can see we started off higher on the day, but have taken a bit of a nose dive here to the downside. And the NASDAQ composite, that too. Now a negative territory flat, but to the downside right now about seven points in the red. But you can see the move that's really taking place there on the far left side of your screen. And then the S&P 500 also flat, but to the downside. But again, same case there about 10 a.m. we got some economic data that poured in. And so the market's starting to react to that. But I also want to take a look at some movers that we've got here on the day. And particularly, there is one mover that I want to zero in on. And it comes in the form of Activision Blizzard. I'm just going to locate their ticker symbol very quickly here. It's up by about 1.2 percent. And also keep an eye on Microsoft shares with regards to a ton of news that's coming out from the companies today, particularly around the review of this acquisition. And of course, the EU is setting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,6,2022-11-01 14:10:08
4511," Microsoft shares with regards to a ton of news that's coming out from the companies today, particularly around the review of this acquisition, of course. The EU is set to conclude their review of this on November 8th, and it seems that the latest out of this review is that considering Sony was said to be worried about Call of Duty here, that the EU has not had any concessions received from Microsoft there. So it seems like the review is going to move forward, Activision shares reacting positively here. Microsoft shares they were holding onto gains earlier in today's session, but we've seen a lot of movement take place as well as we've gone on throughout the rest of today's trading activity. Also some new Call of Duty stats that came out today. I'll share those on my Twitter later on. All right, I'm ready for the retweet. Always a big game. All right, before we head to break, we're keeping close eye on Airbnb. Head of its earnings do out after the close today. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney is reiterating an outperform rating into the print, says Mahaney, to see upside to these streets, Q3 gross bookings, revenue, and night estimates given overall positive trends in third-party data, such as TSA throughput. Worth noting here, Airbnb has been among the top-crediting tickers on the Alpine platform among or over the past 12 hours or so. Here are the other headlines we're watching now in business and beyond. A federal judge has blocked Penguin Random House from buying rival publisher Simon and Schuster. That deal would have been worth $2.18 billion and would have joined together two of the five largest book publishers in the US. The Biden administration had argued that the acquisition would hurt competition for publishing rights to top-selling books and the judge agreed. Penguin Random House owner Bertels Minnes has it will appeal the ruling. It's on the hook for a $200 million fee to Simon and Schuster's owner, Caramount Glove.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,7,2022-11-01 14:14:35
4512," In the judge agreed, Penguin Random House owner Bertelsman says it will appeal the ruling it's on the hook for a $200 million fee to Simon and Schuster's owner, Paramount Glow with global if-to-deal, indeed ultimately does not go through. Pilots of Delta Airlines are calling for a strike unless an agreement can be reached between the Pilots Union and Delta. Negotiations are continuing with the union saying it's still driving to an agreement, and the airline saying progress has been made. The news comes as airlines overall struggle with labor negotiations, particularly in the wake of COVID. In Johnson & Johnson, a Johnson announcing it will buy a biomed, which makes heart pumps designed to help treat heart conditions in a $16.6 billion all cash deal. That buy will add to Johnson & Johnson's medical device portfolio, including contact lenses and implants. All this is the company's bulk of its medical device offerings. It plans to eventually separate its consumer-facing brands like Band-Aid and Tylenol into a new independent company. And the Supreme Court temporarily blocked Congress from obtaining former President Trump's income tax returns from the IRS. That decision by Chief Justice John Roberts came a day after Trump's lawyer filed an emergency application seeking not delay. A federal judge had previously ordered the IRS to hand over the tax returns to the committee, which I said it wants them as part of a probe of how the agency audits presidential tax returns. South? Cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, helping to fund Elon Musk's deal for Twitter to the tune of $500 million. Binance says it hopes to help Twitter buy better and corporate crypto into the platform. Here to talk about that prospect, tank, peng, Zhao, founder, and CEO of Binance, and our very own crypto reporter, David Hollerith. CZ, always good to see you. Thanks for giving us some time here. Is this more of a bet on Elon Musk or more of a bet on the future of Twitter's platform? I think to be honest, it's a bit of both. I think, first of all, we want to support free speech. And this is one of the best choices, best chances to do that. Elon Musk is a very strong entrepreneur. We want to support him too. And crypto, Twitter is a ton square for crypto and most of the worst hard topics. So it's a good place to support free speech. And CZ, Elon Musk has gone back and forth, at least, from what we've seen in court documents that showed his text messages. He was initially talking about doing a blockchain Twitter to improve some of the problems he's laid out for the company. And then he also has said that maybe that's not possible, maybe it just won't work. And I'm curious to this juncture, what you're thinking about a crypto implementation or Twitter might look like and how realistic you think it is. I think Twitter today is a centralized platform. So moving that in one giant step into a fully decentralized platform is going to be quite difficult. I think we've got to get there in incremental steps. And for any entrepreneur or any company in today's environment, we've got to make many adjustments as time goes on. So it's very natural for his stock process to change over time. But overall, Elon is a very strong entrepreneur and we want to support him. CZ, Elon has been making some strategic moves with regard to who he's placing within Twitter, who he's bringing over from Tesla into the new Twitter that he sees moving forward. He's even said previously that the Twitter board that he decides to put together won't be paid if he was successful in acquiring the company. Post acquisition and knowing how much you believe that Twitter could improve with some of the same technology that Binance already has, perhaps, and the same ethos as well. Is this a position that you would want on Twitter's board? I'm not against it, but I'm also not actively pursuing it. I'm not very good sitting on boards. I don't enjoy those topics like long meetings, etc. But if my help is needed, I'm happy to, but I'm pretty busy running Binance. We want to give all the support we can, but we'll see what Elon decides. Speaking of sticking to your knitting and running Binance, we see, obviously Elon Musk, who is running a couple other companies, now he's doing Twitter. The initial reports coming out, frankly, have the feel of throwing spaghetti against the wall, as we say. In other words, maybe we'll...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,8,2022-11-01 14:18:45
4513, in a couple other companies now he's sort of doing twitter and the initial reports coming out frankly have the field of throwing spaghetti against the wall as we say in other words uh... maybe we'll charge people for the check marks maybe we'll take away free ads from twitter blue like there's all this stuff sort of field sort of trickling out it doesn't feel like there is a unified strategy coming from us right now at twitter as an investor what do you and as a user what do you want to see so i think that's very very normal uh... as a investor as a user and as also a fellow entrepreneur i think it's very common to just like you know have many different ideas and see what sticks um... so it's really literally likes throwing spaghetti on the wall and just hope something sticks um... that's entrepreneurship um... so many i'd different ideas should be tried and should be tried quickly uh... i think that my as a user my biggest problem with twitter is over the last year or couple years um... there hasn't been a lot of new features being introduced there should be new features every month every week every day um... and we just see what sticks uh... that's very normal what would what would be the thing that you would want to see from twitter in terms of a new feature actually agree with a lot of what you know you lost ideas edit button um... the way the list blocks band bots there's a lot of bots that spammy my comments section when i when i open my account uh... twits for comments and uh... blue tics uh... they should become more they should be a cost to it i actually really support that idea so all of this should shouldn't really take more than a week to implement each um... so we should have done that like you know a year ago so i'm very supportive of Elon's idea let's let's move quickly let's try new ideas yeah to that point too it's one of the largest uh... uh... benefactors of cryptocurrency trading volume um... thinking of this whole bot situation there you know there are we know from uh... the crypto side of twitter that there are plenty of accounts that share um... you know uh... uh... coins and and pump the price and things like that so i'm curious uh... given that you're also thinking about the free speech mentality on twitter um... how do you think that problem is solved uh... now that you have a financial stake um... i think um... there's a balance between free speech and also pump and dump marketing manipulation uh... hate speech uh... just or just pure lying or or fake information so there has to be a line that to be drawn um... it's not an easy problem to solve to be honest but i think Elon's in a much better position to solve that problem than the uh... look to the screen currently there's too many spam bots on twitter today and so with regard to the hate speech though do you think that there is a significant policy change that needs to be enacted in order to make sure that that is removed from the platform that it is not just a place for free speech but also a place where free speech is not convoluted with hate speech on the platform i think that's a very fine line to draw um... it's gonna be tricky um... i think between hate speech and free speech that's a very fine line but some of the other stuff are much more clear um... fake news um... spam... spam much easier yeah so you see uh... one part of making a good return uh... on an investment like this is Elon running an effective business uh... whether it's sales or profits do you support him laying off 75% of that twitter workforce to get those profits um... i think there's those are two different things i think uh... laying off a portion of the staff it's just to become more efficient um... twitter today doesn't have a very strong business model but it could potentially have very strong business models so i think those two things are separate it's not to say i think uh... revenue is not by saving cost uh... not revenue doesn't come from saving cost um... that's i think twitter's ability to generate revenue far exceeds the it's cost center today um... there's many new revenue models that can be implemented on twitter like charging for blue ticks uh... even charging for comment issue nfts uh... for each tweet um... usually untalking in the future so all of those things can generate revenue for twitter and uh... it's not limited by the by the by the cost savings i happen to think charging for blue checks is a really bad idea but we'll take that offline cz uh... discuss another time by nc o cc o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,9,2022-11-01 14:23:05

CZ always good to catch up with you along with Yahoo Finance's David Holler. I appreciate it guys. Coming up, retail roundup. We'll speak with Bank of America's Lorraine Hutchinson on her top retail picks for a holiday season that's shaping up to be a lot weaker than last year. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. Retailers gear up for the holiday shopping season. Our next guest, though, expects sales to be weighed down by heightened inflationary pressures as non-discretionary prices continue to rise. Bank of America retail analyst Lorraine Hutchinson joined us now. Hi Lorraine, thanks so much for being here. I mean, we all know the pressures that are out there, right, from rising prices for things you need. So you have less to spend on things that you want. So talk to us about the holiday season and how all of this plays out. Do you expect people to be buying fewer things or less expensive things or all of the above? Thanks good morning. Our holiday forecast calls for just over 1% sales growth. We do expect people to be using their money more frugally given the pressures they're facing on the non-discretionary parts of their budget. What we're also expecting is on the discretionary side, a lot of their money has been used this year on vacations, eating out. Things we couldn't necessarily do a lot of last year. So it makes for a little bit of a tougher holiday for the consumer. We would expect them to be much more focused on value and much more focused on looking for deals this holiday season. Does that signal that household balance sheets are not healthy as some banks have told us this year on season? Look our, you know, our BAC core data and the work of our institute says that the balance sheets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,10,2022-11-01 14:27:41
4515," Are not healthy as some banks have told us this early season? Look, our, you know, our BAC card data and the work of our institute says that the balance sheet still are healthy. It's just a little, we've seen a little bit of pullback in spending in September and we think that that bodes poorly for the interest in really spending up this holiday season. So we think the consumer's still in good shape, just a little bit more cautious than last year and allocating their dollars to different things. Lorraine, one key problem in retail, head of this holiday season, we were just showing the chart on inventory growth. The retail industry is a wash in inventory. There is a lot of discounting in this environment who sees the biggest gross profit margin pressure, operating margin pressure, and who's at risk of, you know, coming out in early January and issuing a major earnings warning? Yeah, look, we have earnings coming up for retail. We think that they will issue pretty cautious outlooks for 4Q because retail inventories are at all time record highs. Now, some of this is because they brought in inventory early. Remember last year the shelves were bare. They stocked out of a lot of goods, so they wanted to make sure there were in stock. But a portion of it is also they were forecasting demand that just hasn't materialized. So we've seen the consumer take a little bit of a step back in mid June and then we've seen some slowing since then in September. So we think there is too much where we see the biggest risk or those retailers targeting the lower income consumer. You've seen excess inventory levels at retailers like old Navy like coals where the consumer is just has it's just a little bit tighter on the good news side who cleans up those messes the off price retailers. They really thrive on problems with the inventory and and excess thereof. So we think that retailers like TJ Maxx, Burlington, Ross Stores will be getting a tremendous amount of really high quality well branded inventory really starting this quarter. The rain that's the glass half full part of the equation. I want to go back to the glass half empty part of the equation because we all have been getting this sort of increasingly desperate emails right from some of the retailers offering heavy discounting some of the retailers. The big guys like Target and Walmart, they've said we're really addressing this inventory build up. But across the board and retail, do you think that the inventory glut is going to get worse before it gets better? Are is the discounting working to work off that inventory? So we expect the mismatch between supply and demand to peak in the fourth quarter. So we do think holiday will be very promotional. You will get some great deals and that'll help us stretch to consumer. We do expect though that as we hit the end of the fourth quarter so for retail that's end of January that they will have worked through it. I think January will be a very heavy clearance period as most of the retailers are laser focused on exiting the winter season with appropriate levels. When we look to the first half of fiscal 2023, most retailers already had a chance to cut orders. So when spending pulled back a little bit in June and July, most retailers called their factories and their partners and told them to make less they cut they canceled. So we do see some improvement in that in the first half of 23 now that doesn't mean that they'll be pristine. But versus 4Q we think they'll be in much better shape. All right, one of your top picks is Starbucks. Now there's this new CEO getting ready to take the hell there. Have you met with him? Have you talked to him about his plan for the company looking out over the next few years? Starbucks is actually covered by one of my colleagues that it was one of our top holiday picks in my sector. My top holiday pick is tapestry, which owns coach and Kate spade. So, well, to give us more details on this is do you think in general that the higher end consumer is going to be more resilient here? And that's why you like tapestry or do you think tapestry is doing something in particular right even in the luxury universe? I think a little bit of both actually, you know, we think tapestry is one of the few retailers that really did transform during the pandemic. And they took a few actions that we think are really important for the staying power of their earnings. They cut a lot of costs and reinvested those in marketing. They eliminated the bottom 40% of their styles to make their assortment more efficient. And they also added an e-commerce business to their outlet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,11,2022-11-01 14:31:41
4516," they eliminated the bottom 40% of their styles to make their assortment more efficient. And they also added an e-commerce business to their outlet business, which we think added a new customer, a younger customer. So those things combine to give us more confidence in the sustainability of their high teens margins and with those high teens margins come great cash flow. So we're expecting tapestry to buy back 7% of its stock and pay a 3% yield every year. And given the stock is near trough multiples at five times EBITDA, we think that sets up really nicely into holiday and into 2023. New customer, younger customer, it me, buying gifts out here. Thank you, America, retail analyst, Lorraine Hutchinson. Appreciate the time, the conversation is always. Thanks. Coming up, everyone, sort of being through earnings season, we've got some more auto-movers on tap. But earnings reports from get this, Davis, good, you're tire and rubber, we got both of those next. Now We've got some more to more movers to get to this morning here that we're tracking. Just so excited here. We got to start with the shares of Avis though. This one's a big mover on the day down by about 10.10%, 10.2% right now. The rental car company moving lower after reporting an 18% rise in revenue year over year and earnings that actually beat expectations. So it was a beat on the top and a big beat on the bottom. The stock was up at first when these numbers came out but it seems like maybe that they were helped by one time items that are not going to last. That seems to do what they analysts are saying. This was so the earnings $21.70 versus consensus of $14.02. I mean they blew it out of the water but to your point Julie Morgan Stanley out with note just now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,12,2022-11-01 14:36:21
4517," $21.70 versus consensus of $14.82. I mean, they blew it out of the water, but to your point, Julie, Morgan Stanley out with note just now, I think kicking, you know, putting a holdent in this quarter here, to your point saying this might be driven by one time, one time expense savings, and the bigger concern here is that the used car price index, the man-hime index is starting to decline from all time highs, big red flag. Yeah, basically, you saw more depreciate. They're expecting the cars to depreciate more. I believe is if I'm reading this because the cars that they carry on their balance sheet, you know, the value fluctuates, and their saying going forward, it might be less favorable to them, that sort of fluctuation. So, that seems to be the... I don't think it's high on the travel recovery though. Yeah, and then on the travel recovery, it really leans back towards where it's this mix in demand of the corporate travel that's starting to come back, rent more cars, and then additionally, people who just want to be able to continue to maintain if they're traveling in and out of destinations and want to continue to adhere to their own kind of precautionary measures, that leans them right directly into a service of an Avis budget or even a Hertz, if you will, as well. And we've been tracking shares of Hertz to entangle them with this entire industry. All right, let's keep on driving, shall we? Good year, Tyron, remember, also reporting third quarter earnings, taking a hit from the stronger dollar and the spiking cost of raw materials and speaking of taking a hit, the shares are down by 15%. And basically here, coming out and just missing estimates by pretty wide margin, 40 cents a shares, what the company reported, 56 cents is what analysts had anticipated, sales missing estimates as well. And the company just having challenges here and the company commenting on this in the statement saying, we face many ongoing challenges in the quarter, including persistent inflation, at the same time new challenges emerge, including a less certain outlook in Europe and the effects of a stronger US dollar. I tweeted this last night, I'm shocked by now this stock is trading at about a 45% discount to book value. That is just tremendous. It's not something you see historically in the market, but not historically you see with a name like a good year in a leadership position in the tire market, but maybe some simple analysis will help here. It looks like it just pushed through higher prices and their volumes are starting to take a hit. And, adotally, I was pricing some new tires for my car over $1200 for four new tires. I have gone crazy. They have gone crazy, crazy. Now, you need them, but still do you need good years? Yeah, I don't know that you're cheaper tires. I'm sure that that seems. It's expensive though. Do you put the same fancy tires on your car that you put the fancy gas in your car that maybe you don't really know? Is this a low profile? Do you need to ask, I'm not getting cheap tires. You're probably going cheap tires. You're probably going run flats, right? Yes, for this car, yes, run flats, yes. Exactly, all right. I haven't know what that means. Oh, keeps going. Essentially, if you get a nail in it or something, you could probably go for what? 50 more miles. Oh, why? We actually have to do a run flat. It is. It is. All right, well, let's say on cars here, shares of Kavanaugh are ripping higher up about 17% this morning after the used car retailer got an upgrade from underweight to neutral over at JPMorgan, saying investors have digested the risks around the stock. Kavanaugh has become one of the most hated stocks on Wall Street. Wall Street hates this stock. And so it is surprising to see this upgrade. I think the overall gist of JPMorgan here is that our Kavanaugh may not need to race capital in the near term, and that is triggering their upgrade. Yeah, look at the stock performance year-to-date now down, 93%. And even as we're continuing to watch how investors are evaluating Kavanaugh, this does come back to the same conversation of about what the depreciation of some of the inventory looks like, getting inventory that they're actually going to be able to sell through as well. And at what price consumers are actually going to take price and move some of those vehicles off the lot, especially at a time where there's a shift in the sentiment, or at least in going towards some of the more electrified models. And we've seen that show up early in Carvana's numbers earlier this year. Carmikes has reported on the success that they've seen with regard to some of their EV sales, even as you're starting to see the early churn in adoption there, or a churn that is moving more of those vehicles into a Carvana landscape, at least. Want to make a bad financial decision by a used TESO at 60,000 miles on it from Carvana? I mean, that just has all the makings of potential battery. Just not go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,13,2022-11-01 14:40:31
4518," into a Carvana landscape at least. Want to make a bad financial decision by a used Tesla with 60,000 miles on it from Carvana. I mean, that just has all the makings of potential battery just not going well. But let's look at the markets here. Let's do a quick market check. We're seeing the markets really come off a little bit today. You know, earlier on the show, we were talking about a little bit hotter than expected Joltz report. ISM coming in reasonably well. Perhaps the Fed not liking to see that. They'll have to stay a little bit further along on their rate hikes. But right now, we're seeing all three major indices in the red coming up. We'll check in with Winxstop CBL as the chain turns out those bonus wings for football Sundays. We'll be right back. Winxstop is coming off a better than expected quarter for sales. As diners embrace, the company's new chicken sandwich. It also helps from a profit perspective. The chicken wing prices have star two or they have flown lower. Let's check in with Winxstop CBL, Michael Skipper. Mike, good to see you. As always, last time we talked to you, you guys were really one of the first restaurants to call out deflation. Are you still seeing those deflationary prices? And how long do you think will last? Brian, we are. We're enjoying meaningful deflation in our business today. Just as we wore back when we spoke a quarter ago. And as we look at some of these leading indicators around our overall supply chain, it seems to suggest a backdrop of continued favorability from a commodity perspective for the balance of 2022. And into the beginning of 2023. A lot of new menu items that you've rolled out over the course of this year, Michael, how do you continue to kind of look through some of the performance indicators and in different markets as you kind of continue to look through the menu and what consumers, even regardless of pricing, what they're gravitating towards right now. Yeah, Winxstop's in a really unique spot in that in the second quarter, our business was hit with the perfect storm. And we were able to lean into a proof.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,14,2022-11-01 14:44:57
4519," Now, yeah, Wingstop's in a really unique spot in that in the second quarter, our business was hit with the perfect storm. And we were able to lean into a proven value playbook, as well as pull some unique growth levers that we have as a brand. And one of those being leaning into menu innovation and introducing chicken sandwich to consumers out there. First time we've done that as a brand. And we think that's a meaningful long-term sustaining sales driver for our business. And just launching that along with some of the other levers we pulled, translated to a 6.9% SamStore sales growth in the third quarter. And what's really great about that growth is the majority of that came with transaction growth. I think we talked to you about this last time, Michael, with the prices, the raw material prices coming down for you guys. I don't imagine your cutting prices for consumers, but I imagine maybe you're keeping them steady. How long do you do you, I mean, for the foreseeable future, do you think we'll see some stability there? We've talked about the unique spot we're in this year, where we haven't had to take any price, where the rest of the industry to manage their margins has had to take meaningful price this year. And you're seeing that start to impact some of the transactions in their business. And we've been able to lean into that value playbook and not necessarily take any price this year. And percent consumers with meaningful value so that they can enjoy that indulgent, wingstop occasion. Michael, my team here doesn't think I watched football, but I, in fact, do. And I was watching football and I've seen you guys start to pop up on TV. Are you getting return on that investment in the NFL? And what does it look like? We are, Brian. We're seeing a meaningful increase in our investment and advertising this year, the back half of this year, we're increasing our investment over 35% and you're seeing this as you mentioned, show up in a big way in an NFL, as well as the NBA that's just kicked off in live sports. And that's helping us close the gap that we have in brand awareness to other national brands that are out there. And again, another one of those multiple sales driving levers that we have that give us confidence in our ability to deliver our 19th consecutive year of same-store sales growth this year. Are people coming in store? Are they ordering through digital app? What is that touch point? Especially when you think about that customer acquisition cost and the awareness generation that you're ramping up right now? Yeah, wingstop's been an industry leader from an investment in digital and we had a really strong digital business before the pandemic hit. And then obviously we saw explosive growth during the pandemic in our digital business already a business that was heavy off premise. Over the last three years through the third quarter, we've seen ourselves grow north of 36% in that digital business that I referenced is over 60% of our business today. And that's a stickiness that we've been able to really hold since consumers have started to normalize their behavior a little bit to pre-pandemic behaviors. But those digital customers that we've brought into our brand, we've been able to hold on to them and continue to build from there. Michael, good to see you. Thanks for stopping by. Michael Skipworth, the wingstop CEO and president. Well, from chicken wings to your Thanksgiving turkey, the Thanksgiving dinners about to take an even bigger bite out of your wallet this year. With the cost expected to rise by nearly 15% over last Thanksgiving. That's according to a new report from Wells Fargo out just this morning. Now, I'm going to finance his book to Pomema is here with the details. So what's gotten where are we seeing prices go the most higher for the various Thanksgiving components, Brooke? Julie, well, first let's start with the star of the show. Of course, that is the turkey. The turkey is expected to be cost rather 23% more than this exact time last year. And that's according to the US DA, of course. Here, we're looking at frozen, which is what most consumers get this time of year for a frozen whole hand customers can expect to spend a dollar 64 per pound. Now, that's for an eight to 16 pound hand, of course, larger families going for those 20 plus pound hand. So it certainly does add up. Of course, it's time of year. We're also taking a look at some stocks behind turkeys. We have whoremel foods behind Jenny. Oh, when Applegate farms, of course, seaboard also owns a steak and butterball. But according to Brad Ruben, a Wells Fargo, he told young who finance that if you're.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,15,2022-11-01 14:49:01

I hope finances own. Thanks for joining us with the news about Turkey coming up Herbalife. Yeah, it's down right now. Half per cent after the company pulled out. That's nice. That's nice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,16,2022-11-01 14:53:36
4521," B Welcome back everyone. Cypher Cut for Times, ReStories, one minute each. We start with this on the day. Herbalife Nutrition has renamed Michael Johnson as Chairman and interim CEO following news that Chief Executive John Aguinovi would be stepping down. Johnson has already served the CEO from Herbalife from 2003 to 2017 and from 2019 to early 2020. The company also announced it is withdrawing its full year 2022 guidance and will periodically reassess when they believe future performance can be reasonably estimated. All right. The return of the CEO, um, call it a comeback. Yeah, talk about everything you don't want to see in an earnings release. Your CEO essentially kicked out. You have no guidance. Oh, yeah, your quarter-ostal stunk. Uh, you know, I covered this company way back when Bill Ackman said it was going to go to zero and famously shorted it. He ended up throwing in the towel on that eventually. Carl, I can't remember had taken the other side of that trade. And honestly, after a while, I stopped paying attention to it because it did that, right? It's been going down now for a couple of years. And so it didn't go to zero. But it's a smaller company than it was. Remember this is a multi-level marketing nutrition company? And I could talk for a long time. Pyramid? I'll leave it. Allegedly. And checking it on Moulson Chores, beverage company shares, infocus, falling a beat on Q3 revenue as net sales grew 4%. The beer maker also reaffirmed its full-year outlook as it continues to navigate the higher cost environment and overall global inflation pressures. Uh, decent quarter from Moulson Chores. I wouldn't say it was as good as what we heard from AB Inbef earlier in the week and then even what we heard from Constellation Brands a couple weeks ago. By do like the fact that Moulson Chores is putting Chores light, Miller light and Chores banquet in the premium beer category to me, I enjoy all those beers and they taste very premium in my humble view. I didn't get as deep into this one but did they say anything about where the consumer tastes might be changing or shifting? Because I mean, liquors, wines or wines and spirits rather. That has been something that I think consumers gravitated towards during the pandemic and then we saw kind of a little bit of a move away from that and towards some of the new canned cocktails as well here. Yeah, ready to drink. I mean, that's been one of the biggest drivers of the whole industry. It's great to that new Jack and Coke in a can comes out from Coca-Cola in the first part next year. That could be pretty big. That's innovation in this fine form. It's not already out? Not out. It's launching a little bit in Mexico but soon in the US early next year. I'll fake one then. All right. Speaking of returns, could we see the return of Vine Twitter's new owner, Elon Musk, reportedly is thinking about bringing back the short firm video app that Twitter had bought and abandoned. He tweeted out of poll yesterday asking users if they thought he should bring back Vine 69% of the near 5 million voters say yes, they want Vine back to Napster. I know that sauce is a big fan of this. Big. I'm sort of agnostic on Vine. You like Vine? Well, this set me back to some of the Vines I posted in 2014. They are out there on the internet and why I liked it and I remember it was just simple to use. You put your finger on the button and you make a Vine. It wasn't as complicated as with TikTok. Instagram's okay, but you know, Vine, which is very simple and very intuitive. But why would it be a separate thing if he's acquiring Twitter? Of course, yeah. You could have a separate app experience, but why not fold it into the same app and be able to just have similar to what Instagram has with a different button for reals. Just have that for Vine within the same Twitter experience. Like I said, Spedgetting against the law, people. But according to CC, that's how you do it when you're an entrepreneur. Thank you to Binance tweeting out our article, really blowing up there on Twitter. Sure. Okay, we're going to leave it there. Let's take a look at Stocks, shall we? Because we started things out today higher and now we are seeing Stocks lower. And Blame it on the economic data that we got at 10 a.m., which was stronger than estimated. More job openings, more manufacturing activity, bad news.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,17,2022-11-01 14:57:52
4522," Blame it on the economic data that we got at 10 a.m. which was stronger than estimated. More job openings, more manufacturing activity. Bad news, perhaps, for the feds supposed coming sometime pivot, sometime. Let's go get that course light. Let's do it up. All right, we'll move. I'm in. All right, coming up, Brian Sonny. He's gonna be back. He's gonna charge your blickery to speak with the sofa. CEO Anthony Noto, as he mentioned, on the back of that company's earnings report, you don't wanna miss it. Happy Tuesday, everybody. Who got it? That's Qiu Qi. Here we go. Where did the.... Welcome to Yahoo Finance. It's 11 a.m. in New York. I'm Jared Blyckery in for a Kiko Fajita. And here's what I am watching today. Uber shares accelerating to the upside the ride sharing and delivery company reporting a bigger than expected third quarter loss. But revenue clocking in higher than Wall Street estimates. We're going to be breaking down those numbers for you. And so far is surging the FinTech company boosting its outlook reporting stronger than expected third quarter earnings. So five CEO Anthony Noto will join us later in the hour and Musk's Twitter takeover. Elon is reportedly bringing more than 50 Tesla employees to help build his vision for Twitter. But at what cost to Tesla? We have all the details coming up. But first, first we're going to take a look at the stocks and we can see Dow's down on about 188 points. S&P 500 in the NASDAQ are each down about half a percent. And if we take a look at the bond market, we're saying yields across the curve a little bit depressed right now, except for the 13 week T bill yield. That's not shown on your screen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,18,2022-11-01 15:02:46
4523," percent. And if we take a look at the bond market, we're seeing yields across the curve a little bit depressed right now except for the 13 week T-bill yield. That's not shown on your screen. However, we do have that eclipsing to the upside of the 10 year T-bill yield of 4.04 percent. We're going to be talking about that with a number of analysts in a second. And now we are taking a look at some of the latest corporate earnings starting with Uber. The ride sharing company surging after beating revenue estimates in the third quarter and delivering adjusted EBITDA well above its guidance. Here to break down all of this and more is YAHU Finance's prize supermanian and Angelique Kimlani. So give us a skinny on Uber here. Yeah, so you know very strong quarter here. There's that revenue beat up $8.3 billion up 70 percent compared to a year ago. They missed on the adjusted EPS last year but I kind of invested shaking that off. I mean, this is a strong quarter overall with like a lot of their side businesses too. CEO Darik Khazashwari said in the statement quote, our global scale and unique platform advantages are working together to drive more profitable growth with gross bookings growth of 32 percent record adjusted EBITDA 516 million. So they guided that adjusted EBITDA at 600 to 630 million next quarter. Also a guided gross bookings to jump 23 to 27 percent versus a year ago. So strong, strong, strong kind of numbers there. And also driver supply. We're seeing that up 70 percent year over year. So that's good for them. Now we have that Department of Labor, Labor, Rule potentially coming on a classifying gig workers as a full time. We'll see if that goes through but that's kind of an overhang there. But so far so good right enough, Rubar. And what about some of its competitors. We're expecting results from lift and the likes of door dash and they're also subject to that same potential regulation. Excuse me, rules coming down with respect to those gig employees. You know, I think that they're not as well situated, especially it lifts compared to Uber because Uber has, look at this mobility bookings of 13.7 billion delivery bookings of 13.7 billion freight bookings almost two billion last quarter. These are all like delivery and freight or side businesses that lift just doesn't have. Uber is also international and they also have a car rental sort of service with a color partner. So Uber's just way more broader in terms of their offerings and they're able to sort of weather this storm of any kind of macro headwinds. But also, I mean, just popularity of mobility right now, bright share and also delivery is huge. Yeah, I got to tell you, I'm still waiting for the price that's coming down across the board after just surging like mad over the last year, year and a half here. But we want to shift to the healthcare sector where we're looking at Pfizer. They topped estimates in the latest quarter and, Anjali, what can you tell us about these earnings? Well, first let's start off with Pfizer because that is just a very interesting story down on revenue, but beating estimates and definitely a little bit of attention still on their COVID products, really updating the guidance through the end of the year based on the vaccine as well as the treatment packs. Low bid packs. Low bid is flat. They outlook at 22 billion, but Commernady, the vaccine up to billion to 34 billion. And that is still based, of course, on government purchase, the company is looking to pivot to the private market next year, but still a lot there. And the company knows that it is really under the watchful I have investors right now looking to see what it can do outside of the COVID platform. We got comments from the Pfizer CEO, Albert Borla saying what we recognize that some are questioning Pfizer's longer term growth prospects, particularly in the 2025 to 2030 timeframe. That is based on some patent clips that the company is facing. They're currently expecting a negative impact of approximately 17 billion in revenue from that, but we did hear of course about some of the recent acquisitions and the potential to fill that got based on those acquisitions. So that's where things stand for the company right now. A really interesting quarter, really strong quarter. And that's sort of the story for the company, as it seems. All right. Well, how about the story behind Eli Lilly? I believe this company is coming off record highs, but it is suffering about a down day today off about 5.4% as you can see on your screen there. It did completely opposite story there where they shifted guidance downwards for the end of the year also looking at a hit from the stronger dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,19,2022-11-01 15:06:22
4524," You understand that? It did. Completely opposite story there where they shifted guidance downwards for the end of the year. Also looking at a hit from the stronger dollar, about 300 million there. The company also has had an interesting story when it comes to a strong COVID product and platform. The monoclonal antibody from the lily lily is one of the only ones remaining that has any kind of protection against new variants. So that's one positive there for the company. They also have a new diabetes drug that's been looked at for weight loss as well. And so there's a strong demand for that product. And that's where some of the strength comes from that company right now. All right. Thank you for those earnings reports, pro supermanian and angelic kimlani. Now turning to a broader look at the market, US job openings rose to 10.7 million in September. Surprise into the upside and indicating the hot labor market is not cooling us quickly as a Fed may have hoped. Turning us now is Guaralfe Malik, state street global advisors, chief investment strategist. Thank you for joining us here today. Just want to get your take on what you think the FOMC, the Fed has us, has in store for us when it announces its decision Wednesday and then what we might expect in that chair presser later on that afternoon. I don't think we should expect any surprise from the Fed. So I think 75 basis points as advertised. I suspect they will focus their attention more on being data dependent. I think that will be a very reasonable part to take as it is still a couple of prints to go between now and yet end. And I think the pricing of about a terminal rate of 4.75 to 5 now seems in line with the expectation. So I don't think there's any surprise to expect from the Fed. I think the challenge for them is going to be the straight up between inflation and growth. So the focus is very much on what it would call spot numbers. So what's going to occur with the CPI? With as some of the leading indicators beginning to indicate a slow down. The lever picture of course creates a separate complication for the Fed. And let me ask you about the yield curve here because as I indicated at the top of the show, the 13 week T bill yield climbing across 4% for the first time since I believe 2007 at according to CBO data. I'm just wondering what this is. This is the inversion that the Fed is really paying attention to when the 13 week on the short end rises above the 10 yield on the long end. And that is happening as we speak. What are the implications for this? I mean, generally when you think about, so clearly, Fed is focused on this. But generally when you think about inversion in our experience, you're looking at past recessions. And as you think about recession activity, I think the 10s, 2s is what matters a bit more. We generally see flattening starting to occur about 3 to 5 quarters after the first hikes. So if you think about March, that would suggest to us that maybe we start thinking about flattening some point of time occurring in Q2 of next year, the Q1 Q2 of next year, which may set us up for Fed talking about perhaps growth concerns and maybe about rate cuts towards the end of the year. So that's I think how we're seeing this play out over the next several months. And I got to ask you about two of the major headwinds that markets have faced this year. One is the strong U.S. dollar taking a little bit of a breather recently. And the other is China. We know that the Chinese stocks took a huge hit this year. And part of that is their idiosyncratic story with respect to President Xi taking on a third term over the year. But what is the strong dollar in weak China mean for you and any potential inflections there that you see on the horizon? Yeah, I mean, I think that one is that I mean, I get it that there was quite a lot of negative reactions from the conference. I think our approach is let's wait and see sort of like the news that came out today a little bit about that maybe there's COVID relaxations. We do see signs that maybe that is the part that the Chinese authorities will take. I think if you look at the dollar and play in sort of throwing China in the bigs, there's our two supports for the dollar. One is the caddy trade. We know that peak some point in time between now and say, Q1 of next year. And the other one is the growth trade off that the US is removed from Russia, Ukraine issues, energies a lesser of a concern than other parts of the of the world. But the Fed is focused squarely on bringing down down growth in the US.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,20,2022-11-01 15:10:45
4525," energy is a lesser of a concern than other parts of the of the world. But the Fed is focused squarely on bringing down down growth in the US. Conversely, in China's case, there's only upside, right? I mean, we're probably going to see somewhat near-truth growth as we look at this year from last time by that somewhere between three and a half. Next year, we do see prospects of both physical easing. We see prospects for COVID reopening that gives a chance to say that perhaps Chinese growth misapprise on the upside. We have that pegged about four and a half to five as we look at next year. I think that growth differential matters a lot because as investors have spoken of the growth differential, perhaps we start seeing a peak and maybe even a decline occurring in the in the dollar, which should be positive for non-US assets that would be Europe and of course EM and China that whole complex tends to benefit with that with that with that trade. So it's definitely worth by too much of attention to what occurs in China and we just encourage people to wait and see what actions get taken rather than just the rhetoric. Well, we're going to have to leave it there, but we thank you for your insights here. Guadolph-Malik, State Street Global Advisors, Chief Investment Strategist. Well, we just talked to Uber earnings. We got to talk DoorDash. Those shares getting a boost thanks to Uber's strong third quarter report. DoorDash shares have been battered this year. US emerges from the COVID pandemic as investor caution on consumer spending grows. The delivery service releases its third quarter results after the bell on Thursday, analysts are expecting a loss of $0.7 per share on revenue of $1.6 billion. Now, coming up after this, the Fed has begun the first day of its Q-Day meeting. We'll discuss their plans for interest rates, what those might be up next. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,21,2022-11-01 15:15:12
4526," MUSIC Welcome back. As the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates by 75 basis points for a fourth consecutive meeting. Let's bring in Yahoo finances. Alexandra Seminova for more on what this could mean for the economy moving forward. So 75 bits priced into the market. All kinds of conjecture on the press. But what should we be expected? Yeah, Jared. Unlikely that we'll see any surprises on Wednesday. Markets already pricing in that fourth 75 basis point rate hike, which will bring the Federal Funds rates to range of 3.75 to 4%. Now the key thing for investors will be what Jay Powell says in the post meeting press conference and the accompanying policy statement Wall Street will be looking for some insight about what they can expect in December. Now some Federal Reserve officials have raised the possibility that at one point it will make sense to talk about slowing the pace of rate hikes as we reach this inflection point in the economy. And especially because their impact is a bit lagged. Economists, Goldman Sachs actually said that they expect Chair Powell to hint that the FOMC is likely to sell the pace to 50 basis points in December. But it's unlikely that Powell will outright come out, come on and talk about any kind of policy shift. It's still too early and December is a bit of a coin flip at this point. If we keep seeing economic data that surprises to the upside like Joltz today, manufacturing today, we could get another 75 basis points in December, but it also could be 50. It could be 25. So let me get this straight. 75, 50 or 25 didn't hear 100 in there. So maybe that's good news for stocks, which could be bad news for stocks. The way we interpret these things as well. But what about that pivot? We've been talking about that. It's something that seems a little bit more distant off into the future in actual pivot, but maybe just a little bit of softening is what the market is expected. Yes. So the consensus is that they'll start discussions about a pivot in 2023 and at least about slowing the pace of hikes. But Wall Street keeps pushing back against this idea that a pivot is imminent. We have the big bang certainly pushing against that idea. Goldman Sachs, even though it's projecting a 50 basis point hike in December, actually raised its forecast to another 25 basis point increase. So we're looking at 50 in December, 25 in February, in 25 in March. In addition to that 75 point hike tomorrow, it actually raised its federal funds forecast to up to 5%. Bank of America, JP Morgan, also saying that the Fed won't pivot until into 2023. And this is because the reality is inflation is still high. It's well above the Fed's target of 2%. We still got that 8.2% figure in the CPI print. We certainly do. We got some more figures ahead. But everybody, stay tuned. We're going to bring this to you live tomorrow in about 26 hours, something like that. I'll do the math tomorrow. All right. Continuing this with the busy week and the job openings and labor turnover survey, also called Jolts. That was released this morning. Joining us now to break it all down is the labor market. On the labor market is Alice in Boxer. She is a US economist, economist for PIMCO. Alice, and thank you for joining us here today. We've been handicapping the Fed. What might happen with that big decision tomorrow and the Powell Presser? Lots of people saying don't expect a big change, but the devil is in the details here, right? Yes. Well, first of all, good morning. Thanks for having me. Completely agree. You know, we're not expecting any big surprises on rate hikes. We don't think there's a lot that the Fed's going to surprise in terms of the statement. So really, the question all comes down to chair Powell's comments during the press conference. We think the question is, it's not really around PIMMIT. But really that the Fed is likely to pause as we think about interest rate hikes early next year. And I think the Joltz data that came out this morning that you mentioned really underscored the difficulty that I think the Fed faces in communicating this over the next few months. Joltz data suggested there's still plenty of economic momentum behind us. And I think that's why it's going to be so challenging for the Fed to ultimately communicate what we think will be a rate hike pause at some point in early 2023. Well recently, within the last couple of months, we had Neil Keshe-Karig come out and say, flat out that the Fed didn't like the reaction when stocks were up on a particular Fed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,22,2022-11-01 15:19:27
4527," Yeah, I was within the last couple of months. We had Neil Kashkari come out and say, flat out that the Fed didn't like the reaction when stocks were up on a particular Fed announcement day when they had to deliver bad news. So I'm just wondering, what are the chances that Powell comes out in tomorrow's press or end just kind of reiterates his Jackson Hole thesis, which is I'm standing, I'm sticking to my guns and we're going to hike until something breaks here. Yeah, I think the Fed tends to, you know, in general avoid commenting on specific parts of the market. And really if you take a step back, they use the sort of broader financial conditions framework. And I think that what chair Powell is going to be trying to accomplish, you know, it's really this idea of trying to move financial conditions sideways. So we've seen, you know, we've seen a lot of financial conditions tightening so far. We think that they ultimately want to get Fed funds up to a restrictive rate and then pause likely in probably four and a half to five percent range. But I think the difficulty with that is what we've seen with markets recently. You know, there, there starts to be any sort of hint or commentary around this idea of pivoting or the fed slowing the pace of hikes. And you've seen markets and financial conditions start to ease. So I think that's the challenge that the chair Powell has to has to do with it communicating tomorrow. And really ultimately, I think that means that the Fed can't let financial conditions ease too much. And that's why, you know, again, we're focused on on the on the ultimate pause probably not until next year. I want to focus in on some of that labor market data. You hinted at the Joltz numbers that came out. We also have the non-farm payrolls. That's that big monthly report coming out this Friday. Unemployment expected the unemployment rate expected to take up to 3.6 percent. And the payrolls that number coming, I think the street is estimating something like 195,000. How does this report fit into your thinking and what the Fed might do for December? Because this is going to be in the rear-view mirror about two days now from the Fed announcement tomorrow. Yes, I think the Joltz data suggests that there's still plenty of momentum in the US labor market. And in particular, you know, we think that the Joltz data is consistent with this idea that companies sort of exited the pandemic period understaffed. There were a variety of reasons why it was difficult to fill openings in 2021. So we think the US labor market is playing a little bit of ketchup. You see that with elevate in openings. You see that with expectations that we're going to get another strong employment report for October. But to go back to the Fed, I think it's important to keep in mind that the Joltz data, the openings data, employment reports do tend to be lagging indicators. And just because we've seen really strong momentum so far, it's not a guarantee that this is going to continue forever. We do ultimately think that the tighter Fed policy is going to slow the labor market. But at least for now, Joltz is very consistent with strong momentum. Question of if I actually question of when, not if really appreciate your thoughts there, Ellison Boxer, PIMCO US economist. Thanks again. Well, coming up, visaencrypto.com, teaming up for the World Cup, find out what they have in store for soccer fans. Some would call it football event up next. Thanks again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,23,2022-11-01 15:23:57
4528," Kon routines pin Kak Welcome back. Visa and Crypto.com are partnering up ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in a two-part sponsorship, including with an FT auction featuring digital art inspired by iconic World Cup goals with more on all of this is Yago Pance's David Hollerith. So David, what is the skinning here? It seems kind of interesting. Yeah, so it's a two-part sponsorship and the first is an NFT auction that Visa has sort of created these. They've taken historic goals scored by former World Cup players and the goals range anywhere from 2002 goal by Jared Borgetti. It was a header. It was pretty awesome shot to 2015 goal. And so what they've done is they've taken these shots and with the players and an artist turn them into abstract arts, art, which has then been turned into an NFT. So they're selling these at auction on Crypto.com ahead of the World Cup. Then actually in Doha, Qatar during the World Cup, Visa is going to have sort of this live activation they're talking about, which is where they've set up a football pitch and fans can go there and they basically don't wearable sensors and they can they just play soccer and their movement can be interpreted by an algorithm that then turns it into an abstract or picture image that is then minted into an NFT. So the whole thing can be read one way. It's just Visa's latest experiment at introducing Crypto to a global audience, but it's also a bit of it flexing its own growing Crypto technology prowess. But this also sort of underlines just what's been going on with Crypto marketing and sports in general. And since the bear market, we might even be seeing the most innovative marketing efforts happening from these players that are less exposed to Crypto, which is kind of an interesting development. Last year they described it as a spending gold rush where Crypto firms would put so much money into sports sponsorships and that's declined about 30% this year based on data that's tracked by IEG, IEG only tracks sports sponsorships from Crypto firms for the US big four leagues, which is the MLB and others. But the interesting thing to point is that the number of sports sponsorships by Crypto firms this year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,24,2022-11-01 15:28:19
4529," and others. But the interesting thing to point is that the number of sport sponsorships by crypto firms this year, 90 percent happened in the first half of the year before token prices were collapsed. And since then, we're seeing a huge difference between the number of active deals and the number of deals that actually result in a contract that's signed. So this, these didn't actually disclose the cost of this sponsorship, but it is not something like a naming right steel that we saw last year, which is estimated to be far more expensive than something like this. But the interesting thing is that this is actually potentially a more interesting use of sort of taking the technology and testing it. And it's kind of fascinating that Visa is doing this and not a crypto firm itself. These crypto firms when they're looking at sport sponsorships, they're looking more for household recognition sort of the Visa, of course, at this point is really just trying to get the technology in the hands of people. Well, yeah, you got to imagine, too, David, that there's a lot more to come with this and that the prices will be even higher. These deals will be even higher once that crypto winter, that dreading crypto winter is finally in the rear view mirror. All right. Thank you for that, David Hollerith. And we're going to stick with the topic of crypto and go to our chart of the day. And it is the top dog or should we say top doge? Take a look at this chart, meme token dogecoin leading the crypto path by more than doubling in price in October, finishing the month with 17 times Bitcoin's gain and doge rose more than 100% during the month while ether gained 80% in Bitcoin, still the largest cryptocurrency by market value. It was up by just over 5%. And this is as Elon Musk's $44 billion Twitter deal drove speculation in the Shiba Inu breed themed meme coin. Now, Twitter's new owner couldn't resist tweeting a picture of his own Shiba Inu flow key dressed up as the bird app for Halloween. Coming up, Sofie shares are popping.

4530," Music Welcome back. Shares of SoFi surging this morning after the financial services company topped analyst expectations for Q3 and raise their full year guidance. So for the third straight quarter, joining me now to discuss the results of CEO Anthony Nodot and Yahoo finances Brian Sasi also in the house. Anthony, just want to ask you about the results here. Double your gap net revenue of 56% to $424 million. How would you describe these results? The results really reflect the diversification that we benefit from because we are one stop shop for financial services products and that we provide the ability to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect. So we're seeing businesses like personal loans, asset businesses like home loans and student loans in addition to our SoFi checking and savings account. We're offering 2.5% on checking with direct deposit and 3% later this week on savings. Driving really strong account openings, which leads to deposits and leads to more spending. We're seeing very strong trends in invest, which is also diversified. We have single stocks as well as cryptocurrency, Robo accounts and ETFs. And we also have a credit card insurance product. So the continued growth that we're seeing with our 6th consecutive quarter of revenue is a reflection of our ability to overcome market volatility, the macroeconomic backdrop because of the diversification of the businesses that we have. Anthony mentioned on the earnings call a little while ago that you haven't really had a year where everything came together. Do you think you have that year next year? I think from a SoFi operating standpoint we do. This year was spent transitioning to a bank. Last year was spent transitioning to a public company and navigating the process with a SPAC merger into a public company. The year prior to that we were still in build out mode on the technology stack platform. Our Gale and Texas businesses are doing quite well. And that was a big part of the story back in 2020. And in all that time really dealing with a depressed student loan refinancing business because of the federal student loan moratorium. So the economy is definitely volatile and there's a lot of uncertainty. If it stays at a contraction of minus 2 or minus 1%, I think we're going to be well positioned to continue to drive great trends, especially with the student loan moratorium ending in December. And when that does end in December, Anthony, what does that mean for your first half results next year? Is it a profit boom? What does it look like? You know, there's so many variables that we'd have to know to answer that question. I think if the environment is exactly the same as today, which is unlikely, we definitely benefit from our resurgence in student loan refinancing demand and still strong trends in the businesses that are doing well now. And we believe our homeland business will be in a much better position by early next year given the number of changes that we've made in the technology and the ability to close faster on a purchased mortgage, which is more critical than in a refinancing market. So I feel like we're going into the year set up to do really well and set more records. If the economy stays where it is or slightly less from a contraction standpoint, we're going to really, really good spot. We want a compound growth, we grew 51%. This quarter and a year of your basis in revenue with really strong profits and 61% member growth. We want to keep those growth rates quite high. Anthony, your company is growing strong. I want to know if there's anything in your earnings results that would indicate trends, maybe that reflect what's going on in the larger economy, something that might surprise us or just kind of confirm what's going on. The big picture here. Well, the higher interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising them to try to also actually pretty improved the economic growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,26,2022-11-01 15:36:46
4531," Economy is something that might surprise us or just kind of confirm what's going on. The big picture here. Well, the higher interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising them to try to offset inflation and cool down the economy is driving a refinancing boom for personal loans. People are refinancing at a revolving rate debt and to fix rate term debt. And so that is, that business is definitely benefiting from, from that trend. The interest rates that we're providing on checking at 2.5% and 3% on savings later this week are a direct result also of higher interest rates. We are passing on the rate increases in our other products and the deposits that we're getting are allowing us to do that at a lower, lower cost. So there's a lot of complimentary elements of our business where one fuels the next. We call that the financial services productivity loop. And that's what you're seeing play out in our results. And I think switching gears just a little bit as the former CLO and CFO of Twitter, what is your take on everything we've been seeing there? I would say first and foremost, I think Twitter has unbelievable potential and that potential needs to be unlocked through the right product innovations. I think historically, you know, the company what I've seen as great potential, it has the best content in the world. Regardless of what's happening in the world, you can see that on Twitter. The challenges, the content is there. It's hard to extract it through the product interface. And there's always been this challenge of getting consensus view wherever on a onboard inside the company or at the board level. And I think for the first time, you have a single owner and a single leader that could be decisive. And the reason that's so critical is you need to iterate at an incredibly fast pace to figure out what types of product changes will actually unlock that value. And it's really hard to do in a state where there are so many stakeholders that have a say. Now, there's one that gets the control of decisions and the consequences and the accountability. And I think that's the right form of whether it's the right team and they pick the right things. They execute well, I have no perspective. What type of products do you think would work? Well, does charging 50 bucks to get on the platform or for the blue check mark? Does that make sense? You know, I was having fun with the debate on Twitter hopping into that conversation. I have a lot of insights of what would work, but it's not really my position to talk about them. It's really up to that team to execute the way. They see fit. I think they should have billions of users given the content they have that's so valuable and they should be valued in hundreds of billions of dollars, not tens of billions of dollars if they can unlock that value. Looks like we've got time for another one. I happen to be reviewing your Twitter feed earlier this morning. I know you're a big affixionado of the NFL having served in an executive capacity there at one time. Any predictions for the season? I don't have any predictions for the season. So then we really love our relationship with Stan Kronke, the Los Angeles Rams and Dean Spanos from the Los Angeles Chargers. It's been a great partnership with them. It's really provided us with the leverage and building our brand awareness that we thought it would. They far exceeded expectations with what they have at the venue that just announced two shows of for Taylor Swift at the end of her tour, which will be phenomenal. We had the Super Bowl last year, the Olympics will be there as well as the World Cup and this year the College Football Championship. So I call the eighth wonder of the world. It's an iconic platform. Every artist, sports league will want to play in that platform and it's for an agreed partnership that's brought us really strong credibility and awareness. So it couldn't be happier with the relationship. I'm excited about the New Taylor Swift album. Big fan, big big fan huge. I'm excited about anything that causes you guys to cover, SoFi Stadium for a media standpoint. Well done sir. Talk about it as much as you can. We're all getting excited. I really appreciate you stopping by. SoFi CEO Anthony Nogo and Yahoo Finance is Brian Sasi. Thank you for that. Coming up, Elon Musk reportedly tapping Tesla for workers to help beef up the ranks at Twitter. We have all the details up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,27,2022-11-01 15:41:00
4532," Welcome back. Uber shares getting a nice little pop there. You can see up about 12% on your screen. Follow its third quarter earnings report. The ride sharing company reported a greater than expected net loss of 1.2 billion but revenue. Top analyst estimates joining us now is Richard Kramer, managing director and founder of Arate Research. Thank you for joining us here today. Want to ask you about your first impression of the results? Well, I think this is a doctrine of relatively low expectations. For Uber and I think most of the tone of the questions on the call was about whether they were starting to see a macro slowdown and that was the real fear. And given the guidance for the coming quarter was reasonable in terms of sustaining a mid-20s underlying growth rate in gross bookings and continuing to show the progress that management needed to deliver to frankly keep their jobs in moving towards profitability, proper profitability for the business. Well, that was a bit of a relief. Well, you mentioned you alluded to the possibility of somebody maybe losing their job. What are the stakes here? What are the kind of numbers that investors want to see out of Uber to achieve that true profitability or I guess enhanced profitability? Whatever you might call it? Well, certainly. You know, Uber has been an investment banking darling for a lot of reasons. Mostly because it creates a swirl of transactions from a very transaction-oriented management team. It has a long track record of steep losses and on a gap basis it had nine billion of losses thus far this year. And they've laid out targets that in 2024 they're going to have a steady march towards you know, four to five billion of adjusted EBITDA. Now we can debate the adjustments. They are stock based comp. They are restructuring charges. They are right off of many of the stakes that were a few years ago being.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,28,2022-11-01 15:45:56
4533," We can debate the adjustments. There are stock based comp, there are restructuring charges, there are write-offs of many of the stakes that were a few years ago being promoted by the investment bank analyst as a great sum of the part story. But the guidance that you're showing under screen right now shows that they are continuing to put up reasonable growth numbers in what people thought would be a much weaker consumer discretionary environment. And I think management absolutely needs to execute on this because there's not another act for Uber. If they're not able to deliver a profitable marketplace business on a cash flow, a free cash flow basis, then you'd probably think of other fates for the company. Well, that's interesting. Well, let me ask you about another company, Lyft here, and maybe these fates are intertwined somehow. They're expected to announce earnings very soon. I believe this is a company you cover as well. We've got some other competitors in marketplace, but what's going on with Lyft? So Lyft, we had a sell on for a very long period of time. We've gone neutral on it because the enterprise value of a company got down to a level low enough that you can actually see it as an acquisition target at some stage. And it really depends on whether the founder CEOs want to throw in the towel and join up with another food delivery company, another logistics company, an auto company, or any manner of options. But you're down to a low to mid-single digit billions of enterprise value for the company. It has a brand that people recognize. And so the thought would be that Lyft might pursue the synergies that Uber seems to be getting now, finally, between its delivery and mobility businesses with, by finding a partner. So Lyft is one that I don't think there's a case to aggressively buy it, but at the same time, it's a potential acquisition candidate. So it doesn't really stand out as a potential short. It sounds like we could be sitting here in a year or two years debating a different kind of field here in terms of mobility. Really appreciate your insight, Richard Kramer, of Arrete Research. All right, we want to stick with Mr. Mosk. He's reportedly tapping Tesla for Twitter talent. Now, who finances Alexis Keenan is here with the details and Alexis. All right, you're the CEO, the most highly paid, richest man in the world. You have this new company, Twitter. Why not borrow a couple of engineering execs from this great EV company and put them over here, see what happens, mix them all up. This is all legal, right? Why not? Very interdisciplinary, right? So this report is coming from CNBC. And what they have learned is that these employees are on loan from Tesla and other of Mosk's companies. They say that 50 plus Tesla employees have been authorized to work at Twitter, along with two boring company employees and also one from Neuralink. Also saying that the goal here is to really staff up quickly enough to learn very quickly to redesign eventually Twitter that we've all been talking about that so much lately. What is he going to do with what is Elon Musk going to do? How is he going to reinvent this company? So there's talk about these employees trying to understand the source code, what is required for content moderation. That's a big one, not only in the US, but globally. And also the requirements for data privacy. So there's also some mention though by CNBC saying that, well, Tesla uses different scripting language for its coding than Twitter does. So there might be a learning curve there for some of these folks who are on loan at this point. Now let's just take a look at some of the more specific roles from Tesla. One of these employees has said to be a director of software development, another one director of software engineering, also director of autopilot engineering from Tesla. And also there are Musk associates that are on board to try to weigh in brainstorm at this company new ideas that had a Musk's family office, also Angel, investor Jason Callicanis, also a former PayPal COO and now VC David Sachs. Also there's a couple of Musk's names in there. We don't know if they are relatives of Musk one who had worked at Palantir and one who had worked at Nureling. So also reporting that from Bloomberg coming that some of the Twitter employees managers that were already there were asked to make some significant cuts especially to the product teams at Twitter as much as 50%. It's..",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,29,2022-11-01 15:49:52
4534," Twitter employees, managers that were already there were asked to make some significant cuts especially to the product teams at Twitter as much as 50%. Well, it's really interesting that somebody from the autopilot team might be going over to Twitter and, you know, AI, you got to think that maybe some of the algals are fungible. But my big question is, when are we going to see SpaceX, engineers, and Cosmonauts descend on Twitter? I'm kidding. Elon must made some changes to the Twitter Blue Service. Not the Blue Chex, but the Blue Service. I think this is a relatively new offering here. What are the changes? What are the details? Right. So this is coming from the Wall Street Journal and they're saying that Elon Musk has officially decided to end those free articles that the subscribers to Twitter Blue would receive with their 499 a month subscription and they were basically given access to hundreds of publications, news articles along with that service, but that is officially going to end. Like that service has only been in operation for approximately a year, so you can't expect that the company has all so many subscribers there. They don't disclose their numbers in their SEC filings, but they did in that category year of year from 2021 to 2021 to 2022 have a loss in that category, a revenue loss. You got to expect that there are going to be a lot more changes ahead for Twitter and who knows? Who knows? Maybe Tesla too, maybe SpaceX. We're going to have everybody here to track it for you. Yeah, who finance? Starting up, voters head to the polls one week from today, but what many voters may not realize is that President Biden may have accomplished more than most people think. Stay tuned. Welcome back. Midterms are just a week away and this year more people than ever were be voting with their wallets.撈石 Who finance?

4535," Welcome back. Midterms are just a week away and this year more people than ever were be voting with their wallets. President Biden in mind, Yahoo Finance, senior columnist Rick Newman has taken a close look at some of the positive under this administration. Hi, Rick, what should we expect? Well, I think everybody knows inflation is a huge problem for President Biden. It's probably going to mean setbacks for his Democrats. But we typically assess a president's record around the time in the midterms. He's almost two years in. And there are some things that Biden has done pretty well that I listed an article that's on our site now. First, I think Biden has made the federal government stable and boring again, which I think is a good thing in the way that I think about this is through trade. So if you think back to 2018 when President Trump launched his trade war against China and other countries, you and I are covering that here. And I mean, it was like on a weekly basis, markets would go up, markets would go down based on what tariff, the latest tariff Trump was threatening to impose. And then markets would change again based on whether the threat actually materialized. I mean, that went on all the way into 2020 and nobody knew how bad that was going to get. We just don't have that anymore. That does not exist anymore. I mean, Biden does have a trade policy that's emerging. He is getting tough on China, but it's happening in a kind of a consistent basis with no real surprises to the market. And then when we do get something new, then they step back and say, we're going to see how that works. Just a couple of other things I think Biden has done well. I think the CHIPS Act is actually an important pivot in the direction of industrial policy, which free marketeers don't like, but every other country is doing it. So the United States has to get on board. The big inflation reduction act, silly name for a bill that's really about climate investments and green energy investments. But that is going to pay dividends for probably decades. And I think Biden has also done a pretty good job with regard to the war on Ukraine. He has clearly the United States as Ukraine's most steadfast and important ally. Some people think he should do more. Some people think he should do less, which he's probably got it about right at this point. So I don't think this is going to help Biden and the Democrats on November 8th. It looks like they're going to lose the House and maybe the Senate. I think he's doing okay on some of those things. You mentioned Ukraine here, but also want to talk about China because that has the ability. There's some black swans potentially sitting in there. I've heard some rumblings about an invasion of Taiwan. These are just rumors. Could be years off. Could never happen. But what is Biden's stance with China right now? How is that relationship evolving and what do you think could happen? It's a really important topic and it is evolving. So when Biden came into office, he left the Trump tariffs on Chinese imports in place. He removed tariffs on imports from some other allies in Europe, for example, but he kept those Trump tariffs in place. And then just earlier this month, I think we got, we saw the biggest change in the Biden administration policy toward China, which is these very strict export controls on advance chips, semiconductors, and American technology and know-how and expertise. So that indicates that Biden is going toe-to-toe with China. He does not want them to get the most advanced artificial intelligence, advanced weapons and things like that. And I think that this policy is going to stay in place for a long time. I mean, it could outlast Biden. Tough on China is the new tough on Russia and every administration is going to have to be at least as tough as the one before. So that is an important change. It's going to last. Tough on China kind of emerge a little bit before Trump, but accelerated with him and probably a fixture for years to come. Really appreciate your insights here, young finances, Rick Newman. And in studio and before we leave, we want to get a quick check of the market. I'm going to look at the Wi-Fi interactive here where we see the Dow down about half a percent. So is the S&P 500 NASDAQ down about 71 basis points. By the way, the Toronto exchange up about 1% had some troubles earlier, some electronic troubles with their orders. And here we are seeing the spider sector action for today in the S&P 500. Energy in the forefront. I talked about that energy process here. I heard you policy here and then consumer discretionary taking in the rear. And that is going to do it for us here.

I'm going to put it on the top right corner. I'm going to put it on the top right corner. Thank you for watching. Now, for a global look at the economy, investors have turned cautious after the disappointing release of China's manufacturing and non-many manufacturing PMI, both unexpectedly contracted in October, 22 more economic headwinds ahead. This, as China continues to grapple with COVID-19 lockdowns, we mentioned earlier today that Disney Shanghai also shut its doors to comply with COVID-19 prevention measures. Our next guest, warns a China's economy, will not grow fast enough to compensate for the boost in export demand. It's all from state home orders during COVID. Joining us now with our insight is Waley, BlackRock Global Chief Investment Stragist. Thank you so much for being here. Appreciate it. So as we look at the China situation, we are still seeing lockdowns there, renewed wave of lockdowns seemingly. At the same time, the economy is sort of struggling to break out. So, first of all, I guess, when do you see the lockdowns may be starting to end? And secondly, even when they do, what happens with the economy there? I think it's really important to recognize that there are some structural headwinds to growth right now in the case of China. So, yes, of course, the zero-covid policy has weighed down on growth expectations so far this year. But it's not just zero-covid policies, also export drivers that have been such a big contributor to China growth. During the COVID pandemic period, there is now fading away as the rest of the world switches back on. So as the export drivers kind of fade, actually, that represents a structural kind of headwinds to China growth, which is why we're forecasting just slightly above 3% for this year. And higher than that, of course, next year as China reopens, but not very high. So we're not going to see a V-shaped rebound in the case of China. Should investors just avoid investing in China at all right now? I think the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,32,2022-11-01 16:02:52
4537," this year and higher than that of course next year as China reopens but not very high so we're not going to see a reshaped rebound in the case of China. Should investors just avoid investing in China at all right now? I think the the the the tactical and the strategic case for investing in China right now is challenged because of this also focus from not just growth to broader issues like national security all of that representing a bit of a headwind for structural growth but also in terms of how that headline growth can translate into corporate profitability which is why earlier on in the year we downgraded China from overweight to neutral and actually currently strategically there is a underweight allocation to China government bonds because the yield pick up attractiveness versus US government bonds has been eroded away as we now get paid by holding US government bonds. Are we just not going to see any of the kind of tit-for-tat tariffs that we had seen during the US-China trade war over the past couple of years and even going into 2020 waiting for some type of resolution on where that would move forward or we just not going to have those conversations reemerge and actually for it to get worse before there's any inkling that it may get better. I think it's very optimistic to hope for a resolution around the trade war and tit-for-tank between US and China. In fact if anything we have seen acceleration of some of that geopolitical tension so thinking about the focus on cheap manufacturing, thinking about that the broader kind of decoupling and moving further apart of the spheres of influence between US and China. So I think that is going to be the base case underpinning our structural kind of expectation on the geopolitical front and for investors thinking about investing in China from a global portfolio perspective we need to think about what that means from a risk premium perspective when we construct portfolios. Let's talk about portfolio construction with regard to the US as well. As you mentioned a moment ago we're now finally getting paid to hold US funds which is an experience we haven't had in a while. In fact the US Treasury website has been crashing on occasion as retail investors try to get on there. At the same time obviously there's a puzzle here for the Federal Reserve as it is raising rates. What is your rate outlook here in the US? What are you expecting here from the Fed on Wednesday? Well I think the 75 bits of rate hikes is a foregone conclusion that will happen but what really matters is how far rate hikes can go and also for how long that will stay and also what that means for growth. So early on in the segment you talked about the October rally. We believe the the October rally in risk assets is really on shaky grounds because markets previously were looking for a dovish pivot from the Fed and then they were looking for a pause from the Fed and now markets are getting excited about just the pace of rate hike decreasing which of course it will because you cannot keep hiking as the 75 bits per meeting. So if you select markets wants to see some positive development in terms of dovish message from the Fed but really we're not at that juncture yet because if you look at core inflation it's still very very sticky from last week's core PCE for example still really quite persistent and at the same time the focus of the Fed is really solely on the politics of inflation with inflation where things are the mandate is to fight inflation at all cost this year. So we believe that rates will continue rising it will peak at 5% and not to understate it that's a very very restrictive territory. In fact where we are now at 3.25% is already restrictive to the economy right so our belief is that in this current supply constraint environment the Fed is going to have to engineer a recession in order to bring down inflation. Our assessment is that if they were to want to bring down inflation to 2% reasonably quickly it represents a 2% shock to the US economy in 2023 it also represents a 3 million additional people out of a drop pushing unemployment rates to 5%. So this is the sort of the very heavy and high cost of inflation fighting in the current environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,33,2022-11-01 16:07:05
4538," additional people out of a drop, pushing unemployment rates to 5%. So this is the sort of the very heavy and high cost of inflation fighting in the current environment shaped by supply. And that's what we're looking for from the Fed. The acknowledgement of the tougher trade-off from this environment. The market's on shaky ground, like you mentioned, does, you know, just given the potential for more negative news into your end, do you think the gains we've seen in October get unwound? It's possible. Because a lot of the bad news really kind of starting to come together and they have yet to be reflected in market pricing. So I talked about the Fed and the economy, but we haven't talked about earnings season because the shocking kind of downside surprise of the big tech names last week. And yet earnings forecast are coming down, but not down enough. Next year, S&P 500, we're still talking about meat to high single-digit growth for US earnings in 2023. That is really not aligned with our expectation for recession next year. So earnings needs to come down. It's not yet in the price. And I think markets will wake up to that before finding a foundation to the radio. For investors that are still willing to have some type of risk component in their portfolio, they might look at speculative assets that are highly kind of deteriorated from some of their peak values. And I think about crypto. BlockRock has its own kind of blockchain-based ETF as well. We believe you've launched two of them over the course of this year, but I guess more broadly speaking, is this still a time to be kind of looking at crypto even though the valuations are highly depressed from where we began even at the kind of early points of the year here? Well, with regards to crypto, there is a demand. That's why we issue the products to address that demand. The assumptions on return and risk needs to be really positive for crypto to justify even a small, very, very small allocation in a hope of all your contacts. So to your point about where to deploy risk, currently we are underweight development activities, but we're just modestly underweight. We're overweight investment-grade credit. In this environment, we believe that investment-grade credit offers you income and also are pricing in a version of the growth slowdown that we're forecasting. So this is where we want to deploy risk budget at this point. Really great conversation. Waley, BlackRock global chief investments strategist, thanks for coming to studio. We appreciate it.

4539," Alan Jope joins us now. Alan, good to have you on the program here. We talked a lot to a lot of different consumer products companies in recent weeks and trying to get a sense of the consumer is trading down, giving the inflation the R-seeing. What are you seeing in your business? Alan, I think you're muted. Apologies, Brian. Thanks. We had another good quarter of growth. We've raised our guidance, as you said. It's coming in line with our strategic priorities. In particular, our big brands are doing very well. You don't even have 12 billion euro brands. Those brands grew 14% in the quarter. To directly answer your question, our portfolio is made up about 35% of our businesses in premium segments, 50% in the middle of the market, and 15% in what we would consider value offerings. We're not seeing trading down. The premium end of our portfolio is growing at least as fast as the value segment. I think that may be a moment in time. We've invested a lot in our brands in quality and in marketing support. I don't think we're anywhere near the end of the inflation period. We are preparing for potential future downtrading. We're not seeing it right now, Brian. For the customers, as of right now, are you looking at where prices are having to be passed through them and where they're continuing to take those prices versus where they're pushing back on those prices and which product categories are you seeing that most? The first thing to say is that we're extremely sensitive to the situation that the ordinary household is finding itself in around the world and price increases are our last resort, not our first resort. We are doing everything we can to take waste and cost out of our own business. We are very far from having passed along all of the inflationary costs that we have felt to the consumer. One particularly important thing to look at is there are most of the markets of the world outside the US are experiencing simultaneously commodity inflation and currency devaluation. In those markets, we are seeing mid to high-teens price increases, places like Latin America, Southeast Asia, Turkey. In countries with harder currencies like the US, of course, it's just the commodity inflation that is being passed through and even then not at 100%. As far as our retail customers are concerned, we're working in partnership with them so far. It's been very collaborative and we all have the same thing which is to try and provide great value to the consumer. Remember, value is not just price, it's a function of quality and price. Alan, it's Julie here. I have some question about Unilever's structure. If you will, we know that Nelson Pelt is now on the board of the company. We know that you are leaving at the end of next year. What does Unilever look like five years from now, three years from now, as a result of the big change in leadership as well as perhaps changes that he's pushing for? Yeah, I would like to just confirm that Nelson is turning out to be a great member of the board. I'm thoroughly enjoying working with him and as far as he tells me he's enjoying working with me, we recently made a radical, before Nelson joined the board, actually, we made a significant change to our structure. We moved from a rather complex matrix organization that we've had for about a couple of decades actually and we moved to five divisions, each somewhere between eight and 12 billion euros of revenue. Interestingly, after all the work we've done in our portfolio, shedding slower growth businesses like spreads or tea and acquiring into higher growth spaces like luxury beauty or health and well-being. Each one of those five business groups has the potential to grow ahead of Unilever's overall growth over the last five years. So we've done our tinkering with the organization. We've got five very focused business units and Nelson is very supportive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,35,2022-11-01 16:15:40
4540," five years. So we've done our tinkering with the organization. We've got five very focused business units. And Nelson is very supportive of that direction on org change. And Ellen, you know, leave a perhaps more than any other company of its size. Has pushed a lot into some of your units becoming B corporations. And I wonder if you've gotten any pushback either from PELTS or other investors. If there's any plans to sort of pull back on those kinds of efforts, there's been sort of a larger public backlash against some of those types of efforts, not specific to Unilever as well. What's your current thinking on it? You know, we are not an NGO. We're a for-profit organization. And the reason why we care so much about sustainable business, B-cops and other expressions of it is because we think it contributes to the bottom line. We're seeing our brands that offer consumers a sustainable choice are growing much faster. We've taken 1.2 billion euros of cost out of the business through sustainable sourcing. We know it reduces risk. A world on fire or underwater is not a great place to be selling soap or soup. And it's a magnet for talent. Our employer brand is in tremendous shape because of our commitment sustainability. We hear overwhelmingly from shareholders and board members, all of our board members to stay the course. BlackRock work with us on our carbon commitments, other investors work with us on our nutrition profiles, other investors are interested in our commitment to pay a fair living wage and our value chain. These are all actions taken to make Unilever a strong business into the future and improve the bottom line. They're not in any way an alternative to strong financial performance. Alan, is Nelson running the playbook he did when he shook up P&G? By that I mean, is it more of an internal changes in how things operate or is a different situation at Unilever where you might see asset sales within the next six to 12 months? We've been busy on portfolio changes, I already mentioned. We've committed to the market that we are not undertaking a major portfolio change for the next, for the foreseeable future. And our board is unanimously aligned behind the strategy that we've laid out in our last couple of earnings quarters and we will lay out again in our capital markets day. So please don't be expecting any surprises from Unilever. We've got five wonderful divisions, a business that's capable of delivering high quality growth. And that as you'll see from our performance standards, share prices rather resilient through the types of downturn that the world is going into right now. It sounds like Alan, you are enjoying working with Nelson. I do think you'll stay on longer than you expect. Look, I made a deal with myself and my family when I came into this job to do it for up to five years. I'm already four years in the end and next year is five years. We've accomplished a lot of the things that we wanted to accomplish. I am enjoying working with the board and with Nelson as a member of that board. But we've made our decision on leadership of this company and I'm sure the board will do a great job finding a wonderful successor. You know, we often ask executives such as yourself whether you're activating an economic downturn playbook or a recessionary playbook. But from what you're seeing in the data and the sales that comes through and across some of the core segments that you operate, are your consumers operating their own recessionary playbook? That is a great question. You know, not one of us in this show or in Unilever's business has lived through an operated business through a period of significant global inflation. But we have plenty of markets around the world that have operated through periods of inflation. So if you ask Unilever's managers in Argentina, or Brazil, or Turkey, or Parcestown Southeast Asia, we certainly have a playbook on what to do in inflationary times. And we are following it. I think one unusual characteristic of this downturn is it's a company by high levels of employment and things have to get pretty grim in a household before they start to materially cut back on the type of brands that we sell. So so far so good, we are not complacent and we're certainly drawing on our playbook.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,36,2022-11-01 16:19:59
4541," They start to materially cut back on the type of brands that we sell. So so far so good, we are not complacent and we're certainly drawing on our playbook from those other markets around the world. Alan, finally, we wanted to ask you just quickly about the dry shampoo recall that the company just issued affecting a number of different brands for potential presence of benzene. It seems as though benzene has been creeping its way into various kinds of consumer products and causing these kinds of recalls. How's that kind of thing happen? And then what do you do to address it? Yeah, we have an enviable track record for the quality and safety of our brands. It is true that we discovered very, very extreme low levels of benzene in the propellant of a number of dry shampoo's, our safety experts and independent experts have assessed that there is no safety risk to consumers, but out of an abundance of caution, we put safety ahead of any other value in the business. And so we are recalling a small number of these products. And we have the highest protocols for safety. But every now and again, something creeps through the net and we will be measured by our response and at the moment our response is the most cautious one we could possibly must start. Is there a financial right down that you expect as a result of the recalls? No, the financial impact is trivial. All right, you know, we have a CEO, Alan Job joining us here today. We appreciate the time, Alan. Thank you very much. Alan Mosquisting, no time making changes at Twitter, reportedly working and tweeting into the weekend to review everything from Twitter's code to its advertising. The recent staff trimming done for cause could present the company with another firestorm joining us now with Insight Rich Greenfield, partner and media and technology analyst at LightShed Partners, Rich, thanks so much for joining us. Let's start with some of what happened over the weekend on Twitter. And the verge saying that Twitter is charging, is going to charge $20 a month for verification. What do you make of that? Look, I think that there's a lot of power users of Twitter that would clearly pay businesses, you know, a lot of creators that use this as a business and use Twitter. I mean, you see a lot of influencers on social media. Twitter is where they speak to their fans. And so is there a large group of people that use Twitter, you know, from a business aspect and would absolutely pay every brand in America or every brand around the world, looks to see what people are saying about their brand? I don't care whether you're dealt to airlines or your HBO, you're listening to what Twitter is saying. And so are there lots of organizations and people that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,37,2022-11-01 16:24:28
4542," And then I'm care whether you're dealt to airlines or your HBO, you're listening to what Twitter is saying. And so are there lots of organizations and people that would pay for Twitter as part of and a sort of a premium product or premium tier with analytics and information, including a blue check mark. Absolutely. We've been talking about a subscription business for years. Obviously, they rolled out Twitter blue last year or over the last 12 months, which is certainly a step in the right direction. But I definitely think there's a bigger opportunity, you know, tweet deck is something that's never been monetized. There's a lot of parts of Twitter that sort of are begging for better monetization than just purely being advertising supported. So I like the idea whether the price point is right, whether the actual product that he's envisioning is the right ultimate product. I don't know. He's only been there a few days. But I do think that a subscription business makes a lot of sense to tack on to Twitter. What about on the advertising side because Elon Musk had tweeted out a letter to advertisers. Do you see changes there? You know, you think about what Cheryl Sandberg did at Facebook, you know, now called meta. But if you think about sort of Cheryl's legacy at Facebook, I really think it's what she was able to accomplish at Instagram, where she effectively was able to turn advertising into content. I think when you were scrolling through, you know, this is sort of before reels, but if you just scroll through your Instagram feed so much of the content was so well targeted that the advertising often felt like content itself. And that's really the holy grail for marketers, right? Like you advertise because you want people to actually love what they're seeing, not to disrupt and torture them. I think so much of TV advertising is torturous. I think Facebook did it right and really figured out a better way to advertise. And so I think for the read Elon's letter, his goal or his aspiration for Twitter advertising is it for to feel very native to the platform where it's not disrupt over interruptive of the experience. And you actually like the advertising that you're seeing. So I think that would be great. Again, whether he can achieve it, you know, it's very early days. I've seen a lot of not so great crypto ads and sports betting ads over the course of the last year on Twitter. So he's got a long way to go, but I love the vision. It's very early days, but there is a lot of watchers out there on what Elon Musk will do with the staff at Twitter. And we have seen headlines about the team that's building that $20 a month of verification. That they have to have that code by November 7th, otherwise they'd be fired. There's a lot of quite a bit of headlines and comments about Elon Musk kind of being almost tough, a very tough boss as he's coming into the company. What do you make of this? What are the challenges that he will be facing when it comes to any cuts at Twitter? You know, the beauty of a private company is that you don't report to shareholders like you don't have public shareholders anymore to deal with. You have one shareholder in Elon Musk. And so the ability to do things to do hard things, potentially firing people, potentially changing the direction of the company in terms of what products are focused on or not. This is the opportunity. I mean, I think there's a lot of companies that would love sort of to be private and to do sort of the hard lifting or the heavy lifting that is very difficult when you're trying to meet quarterly earnings estimates when you're trying to meet X Wall Street expectations going private and having the ability to sort of really invest in and theoretically, you know, just given the history of Elon Musk. We should have access to some of the world's greatest engineering talent to bring into Twitter. So there's tremendous opportunity ahead. Again, whether he screws it up, whether it works. I have no insight. I'm obviously not on the inside. So I have no idea. But I do think that there's a big opportunity to do things that Twitter hasn't been able to do as a public company. But do you think that the microscope is very much more so on Elon Musk more than ever because every tweet that he even replies to media reports. He had tweeted out headline about a conspiracy theory about Nancy Pelosi's husband and the intrusion there at their home. Then he raised that headline. There's so much focus on everything that Elon Musk is tweeting right now more than ever. I'd say, you know, one of the things Twitter has been criticized for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,38,2022-11-01 16:28:47
4543," So much focus on everything that Elon Musk is tweeting right now more than ever. I'd say, you know, one of the things Twitter has been criticized for is having a CEO that didn't really use the product. And, you know, certainly that was the, you know, that your chairman of the board who didn't use the product or board of directors like Now you've got a CEO. Similar to when Jack Dorsey was running Twitter, you have a really visible CEO who loves the product uses the product aggressively. He's clearly made some early mistakes or snowed out about it. Hopefully those become smaller in numbers as they go forward. But he loves the product and he loves using the product and you know, even his following. I mean look at his following versus Jack Dorsey. He is dwarfed. And so again, I think the thing that sort of gets lost in a lot of the press coverage of Twitter. Twitter is a pretty small product only 240 plus million people use Twitter on a daily basis. There's billions of people, multiple billions of people that use Facebook and Instagram every single day. There's more people using Snapchat every day than Twitter. Twitter is a relatively small product. And I think the aspiration is always to be something that could be the world's town hall. You're not achieving that with 240 million hot users. You need billions of users. And so can somebody who has a massive following help drive greater adoption of Twitter? That's certainly the hope. And so I clearly think or I could only believe he's going to use his his megaphone that he now has to draw attention to the platform and to get far more people engage with Twitter than ever before. And attention he is drawing with Elon Musk having 112 million followers. Rich Greenfield, thank you so much for joining us partner and media and technology analyst at Lightshed Partners. Thank you. Today a filing revealing he's dissolved the social media giant's entire board of directors except of course for himself. Now it's one of several big changes the billionaire is bringing to the now private company here to discuss more about what Musk might do is Steve Jang. Kindred Adventures Finalsi-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,39,2022-11-01 16:33:21
4544," course for himself. Now, it's one of several big changes the billionaire is bringing to the now private company. Here to discuss more about what Musk might do is Steve Jang, Kindred Ventures founding managing partner. So as we take a look at these initial steps, obviously, we know that Musk likes to turn to Twitter for polls and ideas about things. Are we getting now a clearer idea of what we can expect with a Twitter under Musk? Well, look, he overpaid for a social media company that survives off of online advertising. In this economy, he is performing one of the largest tech LBOs in history in a really soft and thrashy online advertising market coming into Q4. So he is created a big hole for himself to crawl out of. He's got a team around him that's pretty smart and they've been working at the HQ over the weekend and through this week to try to clean up the team in their view and create the team that will let him go back to running Tesla and SpaceX as well. So he doesn't want to do this full time long term. So he is in a crash course right now inside of Twitter probably. And you know, from what I'm hearing inside, is that, I know there are a lot of junior people that weren't exactly senior executives that are getting uplifted and as you've seen a lot of the senior people are out. Well, you're the perfect example, Steve, because that Steve Zhang is verified 40,000 followers. How much sir would you pay for the service that is Twitter and the verification? And if it's not the subscription model, how else does he build this new company that can re-emerge as a public company in five years or so? Look, I mean, on the topic of monetization, no one wants to be fully online advertising supported, whether it's, you know, becoming a marketplace and selling goods between supply and demand or whether it's creating subscriptions, that's the future of all of these social platforms. You look at what Facebook is doing. The reason why they're getting hammered right now is that they're investing like a startup wood in a totally new area that has a five to ten year story arc. For Twitter, I think monetization is not just about the blue check. It's about subscriptions around data analytics, creator, publisher, media tools, community follower management. All of these things are sort of out there as third party services, but they're not good. Twitter doesn't have a robust API anymore. So bringing all that back in, creating a natural developer API for media to use, for web three companies, for media streaming, for like the reddits, the discords of the world, even the Shopify's of the world. That is, they have such a huge opportunity. It's incredible. You know, if you think about media, web three, media streaming, all of these, they were some of the innovators 10 years ago in these areas. You're right to bring up wine. TikTok is essentially a better version of wine. You think about Reddit and Discord. That was Twitter's opportunity as well. And you know, if you look at the history of all social platforms, all these community services, if they succeed, it's because they eventually become a marketplace. Twitter has not crossed that chasm. They are not a marketplace yet. You don't go there to sell products. You don't go there to buy products. You go there to talk about them, but then you move off. And that's a huge opportunity as well. Yeah, they want to become this X app, almost like we chat some say, but you didn't answer the question. How much would you pay for Twitter? You know what? I would pay $100 a month for what I do. After capital, early stage venture capital, we find founders to back through Twitter. They come find us through what we talk about. I don't even blog anymore. Blogging just seems passé and time consuming. You know, we tweet about things. We can pull out our phone and tweet about things. So getting analytics, getting creator publisher tools around that, being able to manage and see who my followers are and what my community is. I mean, $100 sounds like a bargain. And we've seen that the price of Dogecoin, obviously one of Musk's favorite, crypto's that he likes to tweet about actually doubled in the month of October. Do you see him perhaps incorporating that into some of the payment systems as a way to really get more, I guess, get Doge more in the front line? I think that the Doge thing is a red herring and kind of a distraction. Look at their sugar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,40,2022-11-01 16:37:34
4545," get more, I guess, get those more in the front line. I think that the doge thing is a red herring and kind of a distraction. I look. He, Elon has always said that he has a love hate with crypto. So he's not a full web 3 believe it all. And also Jack Dorsey, you know, prior CEO, you know, he's about Bitcoin, but he's not necessarily a web 3 proponent. If you see what he's doing with block. So inside of that company, there are some web 3 proponents on the product side that are absolutely talented. It makes total sense for crypto wallet integration to happen for your Twitter profile and feed. It makes total sense to be able to have streaming media and NFTs and Dow's and all these things happening. Because guess what? The entire crypto industry, their conversation is happening on Twitter already. So it makes total sense. And I think, you know, this and, you know, there's some basic low hanging fruit too. Think about every time you click on on New York Times article link or a Wall Street Journal link and you get a paywall, even though you're a subscriber. Low hanging fruit, have an authentication into your account so that you never have to see that paywall. So these are the types of things that I think everyone inside of Twitter product engineering design. I think that they're eager to fix and I think I, you know, my hope is that Elon and team will allow that common sense and that product development to pick up again. I should sounds like Elon should give you a call. So Twitter like Uber moved on from its founder Travis Kalanick out. They report tomorrow. Curious your expectations for Uber after a really solid quarterly earnings beat last quarter. Stock down, though about 40% this year. Yeah, you know, look, Uber has a complex storytelling problem, one because of the past history and all of the drama, but also because they have a lot of stuff going on in terms of acquisitions and outside holdings with all these non cash charges. So if you strip away all of that last quarter for the first time to hit positive free cash flow, which is amazing. This was the major thing that people were saying this company can never go get profitable and they've proven that. They've also proven that they are the utility network globally for mobility and logistics. No one comes even close. D.D. doesn't come close. Door dash is great at delivery, but they're only in the US. Lift is only in the US for ride train. So this is really a proxy for whether or not, you know, mobility and logistics enabled by technologies can award. So this quarter is really important because this is where they show, hey, this edge, this advantage they have over all these other competitors should shine right now. Inflation is a driver in some ways for Uber. People want to go back to work. They want to earn more. They want to drive on the ride sharing and delivery side. This is very unique to Uber. So we'll see the numbers tomorrow, but my expectation is that Dara and team are pushing very, very hard for profitability to continue to show that. And they are going to be leveraging and really extracting value out of this dual network that they have. Yeah, they really curious to hear commentary from Dara on ads, both on the app and the app. And the tablets testing in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Steve Jain, great stuff. Appreciate you being here. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,41,2022-11-01 16:41:38
4546," you you you call that's according to Bank rate. Here to discuss that is Bank rate senior economic analyst, Mark Hammrich, Mark Goodesia sir, let's dive inside that number a bit. How does it break down among demographics, generations, and political parties? Well, good to see you as well. Generally speaking, younger Americans, and we weren't just surveying voters here, but we're really surveying across the landscape of the country. Younger Americans tended to be either fairing better from their own statements, and certainly Democrats were saying that they thought they were fairing better than the Republicans were willing to say. So it is quite, I think, interesting here that the polarization that we've seen for a number of years now in our country is representing itself in the way that people are assessing their own personal, financial plights. Now, Mark, I want to ask you about this one statistic is 69% place, at least a moderate amount of blame on President Biden for their financial situation. And keep it Mikey, came in in the middle of a pandemic, and then obviously you had Russia and Ukraine as well. But people seem to put the blame obviously more squarely on the president's shoulders. Why do you think that is? Well, I'd say a couple of things about that, Richelle and this great to see you again as well. First of all, I think that there is this notion of an all-powerful president that many people have come to espouse whether it's accurate or not. And there is the old saying that I believe was a hairy Truman put into the public's mindset, which was the butt stops here. And so we could probably talk for hours about the messaging that this administration has tried to employ with respect to the economy. But many Americans, I do think, are perhaps fixated to some degree on the presidency. And frankly, some lack the nuanced understanding of government and the economy to be able to sort of slice and dice where the blame might actually be cast. The number we put up and you discussed earlier was really my big takeaway from your survey that 56% of younger voters versus the 30 we see there. Why that matters is because who votes more and why does that matter? What are the implications for the midterms for Democrats? Yeah, I don't think it's a good implication for them because the thought has been that the turnout in this election will not be sufficient to give Democrats the kind of support that they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,42,2022-11-01 16:45:56
4547," for them because, you know, the thought has been that the turnout in this election will not be sufficient to give Democrats the kind of support that they saw in 2020. And as you say, younger voters have tended to be more disengaged in recent years than older voters. So, obviously, just like prognosticators do when they're anticipating the outcome of a big sports contest, we actually get to get through this election to see how it turns out. But some of the other survey information outside of the survey work that we do, I've seen indicates that broadly speaking, Republicans are seen as perhaps being more credible with respect to management of the economy than Democrats are, whereas the Democrats are seeing sort of playing strong hands-on issues like abortion and the student loan forbearance issue. And, you know, than the question is, is that enough for them to prevail in the sense of holding on to the house and at least holding on to that tie in the Senate? And I would say that the prospects for that are for them not good. And even looking ahead over the next two years, about one in three people expect their finances to be worse. When you look at what actually is making up the financial picture that they're talking about, what is it that they're holding and on with this? Well, we did not question them in this survey about that. But as you know, we survey Americans all the time at bank rate. And so between this survey, other surveys we've done, we know, for example, economically statistically that the excess savings that Americans had amassed during the early year or so of the pandemic, that excess savings is certainly dwindling. And inflation is stealing that cash as well as their purchasing power elsewhere. Of course, inflation broadly is clearly the number one issue on consumer minds. And for others, I would say that, you know, in some ways, this situation has come for everybody in one form or the other, including those who are wealthy, who by the way, in this survey, those with household incomes and more than 250,000 or more, we really saw a strong showing on their part here saying that their finances were better off. Yet they would be the ones who would tend to have lost the most wealth, even on a percentage basis per household, because they were more exposed to the stock market during this bear market that we've seen. So, I think there's fear. I think there is concern about the persistence and high level of inflation, not to mention the fact that, you know, economists broadly as well as many corporate executives are saying that the risk of recession are quite high getting into 2023. We'll really fascinating look at the psyche of voters and their finances heading into midterms. Mark Hamrick, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,43,2022-11-01 16:50:30
4548," you This would be Valdez Law Government Court. The end of the day. The end of the day. The end of the day. The end of the day. The end of the day. The end of the day. Lockdowns spreading across China many are asking is another COVID wave ahead for the United States over the holidays here to discuss that the RSV outbreak and mental health in the workplaces, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek, mercy doctor, really appreciate you being here on Yahoo Finance. Thanks so much. Mental Health really something that matters a lot to me, but let's start with COVID. It's faded from the minds of Americans largely speaking. Where are we in regards to putting it in the rearview mirror in your eyes? And what lies ahead do you think for the holidays? Well, Dave, thanks for that question. And it's the right question to ask. And let me put COVID in context for a moment. We have come a certainly a long way over the last two and a half years when it comes to COVID. Or deaths are down more than 90% from their peak. We have our kids back in school learning in person full time. And many people are able to see their families over the holidays and over weekends. This is all good news. But the reason that we have made this progress is because we've had critical tools we've built, namely, life saving vaccines and life saving medications. We've also used air filtration masks and other tools to help reduce spread. This is a time when winter approaches that we've got to keep that in mind because each of the last two winners we've seen cases rise. And so if you haven't gotten an updated vaccine yet, it's important to do that. And anyone's five and up is eligible, who's more than two months after out from their last shot. It's also important if you do get COVID, whether you're vaccinated or not, that you reach for treatments that you talk to your doctor, especially if you're older, above 65, if you have other medical conditions, because those treatments could save your life. We're also battling what some are calling the triple-demick COVID RSV and flu. It's a buzzworthy media turn, but how concerned is the administration about that possibility? Well, we're certainly working very closely on these viruses. We know that one COVID certainly has spread in the winters. We're already seeing flu moving up quickly. In fact, earlier than it typically does in RSV as well. It is affecting a significant number of children and is in fact filling up hospital ERs in many parts of the country. There are other viruses circulating as well. We see this in the fall. We're seeing it a bit earlier for some of these viruses in typical. And for me, this experience is personally just last week, I had to take my daughter into the emergency room because she was infected with one of these respiratory viruses. She's four years old and was having difficulty breathing. So I know what it feels like to be a parent in that circumstance. But here's a good news. When it comes to COVID itself, there are vaccines available for children six months of old and up. They can reduce your chances of your child ending up severely ill and God forbid losing their life. When it comes to the flu, which is also an issue now, there are vaccines available there too for kids six months and up as well as treatments if your child does get the flu. And with RSV, it turns out there, some of the basic precautions we've been talking about for respiratory viruses are more important than ever. Staying away from folks who may be sick, staying home if you're sick yourself, making sure you're washing your hands. These are all measures that we can take to help protect ourselves from RSV and other circulating viruses. Hope your daughter is doing better. Is there something about COVID that changed our perception or that made our immune systems more broken down and susceptible to flu and RSV? Well, that's a good question. You know, certainly a lot changed in the last couple of years in terms of our behavior patterns and that impacted what we were exposed to. You know, but we fully, you know, and you see when you look around the world at the pattern with which these viruses are now coming back, it is varying. I think they expect we'll settle into some sort of equilibrium.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,44,2022-11-01 16:55:15
4549," But we fully, you know, and you see when you look around the world at the pattern with which these viruses are now coming back, it is varying. I think they expect we'll settle into some sort of equilibrium here. But the bottom line is what has been shown time and time again is that when we use vaccines and the appropriate way when we say up to date with our vaccines, those dramatically reduce our chances of getting severely ill. And one thing I just want to underscore here is what the purpose of vaccines are. Many people say, hey, I got vaccinated, but I still got infected. Is that mean the vaccines don't work? Well, the goal of the vaccine, the most important goal is to save your life. And by that measure, the data, now from hundreds of millions of people who've gotten vaccinated for COVID, by telling us that the vaccines are working to save people's lives. We just need to make sure people are up to date with them. Because if you're under vaccinated or unvaccinated, that's when you're risk of complications and death increases. Important message. Now, one might argue that an even bigger epidemic is upon us regarding our mental health. And that's why you've rolled out a framework for workplace mental health and well-being and some staggering numbers in there, doctor. 76% of US workers reported at least one symptom of depression or anxiety. That's up 17% in just two years. Why did the pandemic have such a negative impact on our mental health? Well, David, thank you for asking. This is one of the great concerns I have about our country now and going forward. Is how do we address the mental health crisis that is impacting so many Americans, particularly young people? And I think a couple of things that are worth saying here, when it comes to COVID itself, COVID added so much strain to people's lives. Not only were people worried about their health and the health of their loved ones, but their lives were turned upside down, especially in the early days of the pandemic. So, I had so important that we were tired to get our kids back to school and give people the opportunity to see their loved ones again. That's an important part of your mental health and well-being. But the workplace is worth focusing on in particular because keep in mind, people who are working full time spend, you know, close to half of their waking hours at work. And your work affects your mental health, but it also turns out that the mental health of workers impacts an organization. It impacts their productivity of workers, impacts creativity, it impacts retention. So, the reason I issued a surgeon general's framework on work placement of health and well-being is to lay out five key essentials that organizations can use to build a foundation for mental health, which will not only help workers, but keep in mind, will help the bottom line and the longevity of organizations themselves. So, what's the most important thing employers can do? And how does remote work impact that? Yeah, so the most important thing that employers can do is to bring workers into the conversation about how to improve mental health, bring them to the table and make sure that their voice is helping shape your approach to mental health and well-being. You can take the framework that we put forward and use it to begin that conversation by asking workers how the organization is doing on those five fronts. And those five essentials, by the way, include protection from harm, that's a physical and psychological harm, a second involved building connection in community at work, third work life harmony, fourth ensuring that people know that they are value, that they matter at work, and fifth, making sure that people have opportunities for growth. We recognize some companies who are doing great in some of those areas, in other areas they have areas to improve. We wanted to put this framework forward so people knew what that roadmap was because now more than ever, we've got to invest in mental health for the sake of individuals, organizations and societies a whole. Means a lot. I wear my mental health struggles in the past as a badge of honor. I have suffered from depression and anxiety most days quite frankly. How do we address the stigma that's attached to mental health in the workplace? And is there any way to address affordability and access? Well, they first thank you for your courage in sending up and sharing your own story. I say that to somebody who not only cares about this but has struggled myself with mental health concerns over the years, especially when I was a child. And look, I think the way we address the stigma, it starts with people stepping up and sharing their stories. It starts with leaders in organizations helping people understand not just in words, but in deeds that we're going to support people with their mental health and well-being. Look, if somebody fractured their leg and needed to be out for a few days for surgery and recovery, we would say that seems perfectly understandable in the workplace. Yet too many workers do not feel comfortable. They're having a mental health crisis saying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,45,2022-11-01 16:59:06
4550," out for a few days for surgery and recovery, we would say that seemed perfectly understandable in the workplace yet too many workers do not feel comfortable. They're having a mental health crisis saying, you know what, I need a little bit of time to go see a therapist to get some help. We have to change that and leaders can change that again, but with the force of their example. And finally, just keep this in mind as well. That, you know, at a time where I know workplaces are feeling like they have a lot on their plates, a lot they have to deal with. It's important that we recognize that mental health is really, when we invest in it in the workplace, it's a win-win for both workers and for the workplace in a short and long term. But also a lot of these measures that we're talking about in the framework I put forward, they don't require heavy capital investment. Sure, there are some areas like providing pay leave to employees, ensuring that they have adequate time off to rest. These may require some investment of time, but when it comes to building an environment where people can come to know one another, building a culture of gratitude and appreciation, ensuring that people know that they are valued and ensuring that there's a boundary between work and non-work time that's respected. These are things that we can do with little capital investment, but they return huge dividends. Really appreciate what you're doing on mental health in the workplace. One tip on addressing the triple-demick in the workplace, see this pocket square? It's actually a mask. See that? We can encourage that. And boom, what do you think, Doc? Well, listen, I'm glad you brought it up because one thing that we have learned is that masks are an effective tool at reducing the risk of spreading, not just COVID, but other viruses as well. So particularly for those who are at higher risk, or if you're living with somebody at higher risk, during this time when there are a lot of respiratory viruses circulating, using that mask can be an effective way to reduce the risk to you and the people around you. And a way to stay in style. You have served in general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, great to have you, sir. Really appreciate the time. Thanks so much Dave. I'm very happy to be with you today. All right, good to see you. In this episode of influencers, Gina Remando, US Secretary of Commerce. The president has been very clear with us. We have to use every tool in our toolbox to help the American people and reduce inflation. We can't make nothing in America. Just we have to, the balance is out of whack. We've taken a ride off the ball. To be a strong, vibrant, global power, we need a strong, vibrant, advancement manufacturing industry in the United States of America. I really believe 20, 30 years from now, when we look back, or maybe even 10 years from now, when we look back at COVID, and we look at what are all the lasting negative impacts. The biggest one will be what happens to our kids. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirware, and welcome to our guest, US Secretary of Commerce, Gina Remando, here at the Department of Commerce, Secretary Remando, great to see you. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us. Thank you, happy new year. Happy new year to you. I want to jump right in and ask you about chips and the semiconductor shortage. I know this is top of mind for you, and understand where things are, but also to sort of ask you about the connection between the shortages of chips and these reports of very high inflation that we've seen lately. Oh, yeah, yeah. Thank you. This is a direct correlation. I mean, the inflation numbers came out yesterday. And higher, I think, than anybody would want to see. But if you did, if you get under the covers of the numbers, you realize that a third of the increase in inflation is due to car prices, which is stunning. A third is due to car prices. Why is that? Because last year, auto production of cars was down by almost 8 million cars, 7.7 million cars. So supply is down. Prices of cars are up 20%. And the reason, like the single reason or biggest reason that car production is down so much is because car companies can't get their hands on enough chips.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,46,2022-11-01 17:03:26
4551," Like the single reason or biggest reason that car production is down so much is because car companies can't get their hands on enough chips and they will tell you that. If you go to production facilities of cars and trucks by the way, you will see many, many cars fully assembled but for chips. So it's pretty simple supply and demand. You know I'm thinking back to X10 which I took 30 years ago. It's like we need to increase the supply of cars so prices will come down and in order to do that we need to increase in semiconductor chips. So there's really a direct link between the two and we need Congress to act so they can fix the problem. And so there is the chips act out there and I'm wondering where that stands right now and then how that would address this problem. Yeah so it's kind of stalled in Congress to be very honest that the Senate worked hard, got the chips act passed. I think last summer and it's been a little bit stuck in the house. Speaker says she's for it, I mean she does support it but we need to move it and so why does it matter? It is essentially it's incentives that the Commerce Department could provide to chips manufacturers so they will make chips in America. If you ever have time for kind of a really scary read you should learn more about how dependent the United States is on other countries especially Taiwan for our supply of semiconductors. Like right now in the United States we make zero none of the most sophisticated semiconductor chips, none of them. And we get the majority from Taiwan. So apart from the fact that we need to make chips in America so we can make more cars, we do some inflation, create jobs. As in national security issue as well we cannot be a secure nation economically or nationally secure if we get 60, 70% of all of our chips from a single company in Taiwan. So in any event Congress needs to move, they need to take action now. It will send money to the Commerce Department. We'll set up a program here where we work in partnership with semiconductor companies asking them to set up shop in America making chips in America. And so would this bill then prospectively help Nvidia AMD Intel, Micron, those US companies set up fabs here in the United States which cost a billion dollars they're very expensive. And also would there be money for foreign companies as well say like Taiwan semiconductor to build facilities here? So yes and yes, yes and yes, we need, they cost many billions of dollars as you said. I'm dating myself, I remember when they cost a billion, that's a lot more than that. It's multiple billions of dollars. And look at these companies could be building more fabs or fab is just a word for semiconductor facility where they make chips. They could build them now in Malaysia, Taiwan, lower cost settings. We want them and need them to build them in America, hiring Americans to make this stuff on our shores. And by the way, yes, we hope that one's Congress does its job and gets us the money. We hope, you know, Samsung, TSMC companies that are not American but in allied countries will be eligible if they put their facility in the United States of America. And just one more question about that. I mean, do you think companies really get it that the supply chain which was optimized for cost needs to be optimized for other factors as well like security? Yeah, I think they get it now. I think they get it now. As you say, so well said by you, I mean, there's been an obsession for decades with just in time, you know, obsession with efficiency and we're realizing that in a world of severe climate, this is definitely getting people to drive in that spice life money, the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,47,2022-11-01 17:07:49
4552," Decades with just in time, you know, obsession with efficiency. And we're realizing that in a world of severe climate change events where storms can take out a manufacturing facility or pandemics or other kind of disruptions, you need redundancy, you need resilience, frankly, you need stuff near you and near your customers, not all of it in Asia. So I think that absolutely, they've learned a very painful lesson. And if you talk to folks who run auto companies or trucking companies, it's been a really brutal year. I mean, like I said, their production is down so significantly. They've had to lay off workers. They have whole facilities filled with half-built cars and trucks. They can't finish them just because they can't get chips. So yeah, it's been a huge wake-up call for the private sector around how to build in resiliency, redundancy, just in case to their supply chain. Does all of it speak to a decline in globalism? And you know, you're the US Commerce Secretary. And I don't know what your thinking is on that. I mean, obviously you have China on your mind as well. Yeah. And they're the political considerations that impact supply chain. So what is your thinking on that? Yeah. I don't think it does. I did listen. I think globalism isn't should be alive and well. In fact, you speak of China. I mean, the president is very clear on this. We have to work with our allies as we confront the threat and competition from China. And we have to actually do a better job of that, working with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, with our allies in Europe. That being said, look, we have, the United States, over decades, has just watched our manufacturing base wither. I mean, quite literally, just wither. We've lost, I think, 30% of small and medium-sized manufacturers in America have gone out of business in the past few decades. So, you know, there is a balance. We need to work with our allies of these supply chains are enormously sophisticated and global. And they should be. I was in Malaysia at the end of last year, and I visited the semiconductor packaging facility of an American company. It's sophisticated. It's huge. Thousands of Malaysians work there. That is a good thing, but we can't make nothing in America. You know, it's just, we have to, it's the balance is out of whack. We've taken a right off the ball to be a strong, vibrant, global power. We need a strong, vibrant, advanced manufacturing industry in the United States of America with the workforce who can do those jobs. And that is a critical element.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,48,2022-11-01 17:12:18
4553, you you I want to shift gears and ask you about Oma Kron and the disruptions that that's causing and I'm curious whether the business leaders that you talk to consider this to be a long term problem a short term problem how are they? it's a very very good question I think look everybody's done with COVID you know everybody is willing to be done with ready to be done with the excuse me I think they see it as short term recently impact just this week the I've been doing around of check-ins with business leaders being in the new year folks are beginning to say it feels like we are peeking and gonna start to come down the other side of the curve it's anyone's guess how long it will take also we're all hoping that there's not yet another variant but I think this general view of optimism that these vaccines really do work we have to get everybody vaccinated there is increasing frustration from everyone including business leaders like why people still won't get vaccinated but I think this a view it's it's temporary and the labor shortages I know I should maybe be asking Morty watch this question but I'll ask you how do you see those right now getting worse getting better and what are business leaders saying to you about that as well getting better but still still a significant issue I would say getting better but still a real issue and the CDC reduced its quarantine guidance from 10 days to 5 days is that helping you think I think so yes I think so but still folks got to get vaccinated right I want to go back a little bit to inflation secretary Ramondo and ask you beyond chips are there other factors and why is this difficult to address perhaps or what is the best way to address it besides the chip situation so you know obviously the the primary lever with respect to inflation is held by the Fed you know so chairman Powell and his colleagues have their work cut out for them and I and I you know trust that they will do the right thing and use the tools in their toolbox to combat inflation that being said the president has been very clear with us we have to use every tool in our toolbox to help the American people and reduce inflation so some of that is getting all these supply chain disruptions behind us the ports congestion at the ports has been a huge issue we've leaned into it it is much better you know the shelves were full for Christmas but you know we have to put that behind us anything that relates to supply again back to econ 101 supply of goods has to go up to meet demand so prices can come down so whether that,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,49,2022-11-01 17:16:09
4554," It's to supply. Again, back to Econ 101. Supply of goods has to go up to meet demand, so prices can come down. So whether that is the actions the president took around meat processing, to increase supply, you know, if meat, whether that's chips, ports, anything we're doing to increase the supply of goods will fundamentally help to dampen inflation. Also, look, there are provisions in the president's billback better package that will increase the labor supply. You asked about labor before. We have to get more folks into the workforce. Women will be able to get back to work if they have affordable childcare, if they have affordable care for their elderly loved ones. Now, that's longer term. You know, billback better is kind of investing now for the future. But the supply matter, supply side matters. You get more folks working. We got to increase the supply of goods, so prices come down. You sound like you're using a lot of your Econ knowledge from undergraduate days. Were you an Econ major? I was. I think that's right. I'm an Econ major. Yeah. Going back. Yeah. Exactly. Sometimes they ask you, does any of this stuff do you ever really use it in the real world? Yeah. Well, I, you do. I went on to study. I wanted to get a doctorate, so I, I come back to it frequently in this job. Right. Absolutely. You talked about billback better. Are you optimistic? I am. About it. I am optimistic. I am realistic. I am optimistic. It's going to get, it has to get done. It will get done. It'll look different. Whatever the president signs. This is a prediction I'm willing to make. The final bill, the president signs law, he signs will look different than what he proposed. Will look different than what came out of the house. But fundamentally, it will be transformative. It will make these investments in climate, in workforce, in bringing down health care costs that we need. And yes, I think it gets done. Can I ask you about broadband and expanding access to broadband and you've kind of got two fronts there. People in urban populations who can't afford it don't have access and then the rural populations where it's an abomination quite frankly. Yeah. Where do you stand? I know that's part of your remit as well, right? It is. It is. That's a huge piece of business here at the Department of Commerce. The bipartisan infrastructure law sent tens of billions of dollars to the Department of Commerce. Our job is to use that to make sure every American has broadband. Rural, tribal, urban. You're exactly right. The issues are different. In urban areas, it's less about access and more about affordability. I was the governor of Rhode Island. There's no rural Rhode Island. It's a very, it's urban. It's densely populated. There's fiber everywhere, but it's not affordable everywhere. So in those places, we have to work harder on affordability. Also, I'm providing digital literacy to folks. In the rural areas and tribal areas, we have the lay fiber. We end, we have to use other technologies. Right now, it's so heartbreaking, Andy, to spend time as I've done in rural America. There is no broadband for miles, hundreds of miles, which means you can't work from home. You can't visit the doctor with telemedicine. Your kids can't have virtual school. In tribal lands, out west, teachers would literally drive work sheets once a week to their students. So the kids could do the work on paper and then mail it back or drive it back to the school. So anyway, yeah, we have to do it. We will do it. We'll do it in partnership with the providers. At the end of this mission, every single American ought to have high speed, affordable broadband.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,50,2022-11-01 17:20:40
4555," you you you you you you you you you also want to ask you about tech companies big US tech companies and their struggles with the EU and understanding and listing your help or asking for help from you. Google, Facebook, in particular. Where does that stand? Yeah. So I think everybody recognizes that there is a need for changes in the way we regulate tech companies. That being said, some of the provisions of being debated in the EU feel discriminatory. They're specifically designed to only affect three or four companies in the United States of America. And that doesn't feel right. And so what I'm saying is, yes, of course, update regulations, change regulations, be pro-competition, be pro-transparency, be pro-privacy. But don't just specifically take aim at four companies in the world. And also just.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,51,2022-11-01 17:24:50
4556," privacy, but don't just specifically take aim at four companies in the world and also just have an open ear to some of the legitimate concerns of American and American business. That must be a tricky balance to strike. I mean, they're not just four ordinary companies, right? Exactly. I mean, they're pretty remarkable with huge amounts of power and then there's people like Lena Kahn who have very perhaps different perspectives, perhaps, but certainly a mandate that would suggest that their power is maybe too large. And so how do you factor that in? Yeah, and by the way, that's true. You know, the president's been very clear about this. Like, we are pro-competition. We do believe there is, there's legislation working its way through the House and the Senate in America right now dealing with that. That being said, some of the provisions of what the EU is considering is, you know, as I said, there's not taking into account some of the very real concerns related to cybersecurity and privacy and security that American companies have and we're asking the EU to have an open ear to that. Right. So part of your portfolio are people not aware of Secretary Romando? Yeah, it's a big portfolio. Maybe everything we have to do with oceans and climate. So 40% of the Commerce Department is related to the ocean and the atmosphere. 40%? Yeah, it's big. It's a big piece of business, what we do here and that's all, of course, related to climate. So I spend a fair bit of my time. I was the governor of the Ocean State in Rhode Island. The Ocean State, that's right. The Ocean State, I love this. I really love it. So you're on the license plates? Exactly. The Ocean State, I grew up going to the beach, I grew up clamming, I feel we have to preserve the treasure of our coastal lands and our oceans. So in any event, I think people probably don't realize how much the Department of Commerce has to do with resiliency, climate, oceans, undersea efforts. You talk about being governor of Rhode Island. How is this job different from that job? Yeah, it's pretty different. You know, Rhode Island is a small place and you can make things happen quickly when you're the governor. So this is obviously, you know, just the building where we're sitting is gigantic and we have almost 60,000 employees just in the Commerce Department. So I'd say that is different. In many ways though, leadership is leadership. You know, you set a vision, you manage your team, you drive to results. So in that way, it's very familiar. Working with the legislature is also very familiar for me. I enjoy it. I like it. It's part of the job. I did that as governor. I'm doing that here. When you were governor of Rhode Island, you were out front back then saying that schools should stay open. I know you're not education secretary, but what are your thoughts on what's going on with their schools right now with the pandemic? I still feel kids need to be in school. You know, these vaccines are safe. That's be safety. Obviously, it's to keep our teachers safe and our kids safe. No doubt about it. That means good protocols, more testing. Everyone has to be vaccinated. But with those precautions, kids ought to be in school. That I really believe 20, 30 years from now, when we look back, or maybe even 10 years from now, when we look back at COVID, and we look at what are all the lasting negative impacts, the biggest one will be what happened to our kids, the mental health issues, how they have fallen behind in their education. And of course, this will just, this again will contribute to the lack of equity in America, because it'll be the children who didn't have broadband, whose parents couldn't stay home to teach them, who are already a little bit behind, who are just so much further behind. So I have religion on this time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,52,2022-11-01 17:29:26
4557," Parents couldn't stay home to teach them, who are already a little bit behind, who are just so much further behind. So, I have religion on this topic. I also have two teenagers. And I see it. We've got to get kids in school. There is a recent article out there talking about your future and being a bright light in the Democratic Party. I wonder what your ambitions are, Secretary Ramanda. To get through the week. I mean, like, I have a big, big, big job here. We just touched on it. So, this is what I'm focused on. Alright, and finally, a sort of related question, but a little different, I hope, isn't. What do you see as your legacy here and maybe personally? Gosh. Wow. Here, I think this, the broadband that we talked about will be, if I do it right, my legacy. This is fundamental. You know, this is this, this done properly. It will be comparable to any of the biggest infrastructure implementations in our nation's history. And as I look towards like the economy and the divide, the digital divide and how that plays into the economic and opportunity divide, there's a huge sense of urgency around getting broadband to everyone. So, I think in this job, that'll be a big portion of it. Focus on that. Yeah. Alright, US Commerce Secretary, Gina Ramanda, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. You've been watching Influencers. I'm Andy Sirwer. We'll see you next time. Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Sousa here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Another earnings heavy morning with the likes of Pfizer, so fine. Uber giving up beat. Alex, all three major industries are in the green right now following some of those better than expected earnings reports. But Julie, now let's, let's start on some breaking news on the jobs front. Yeah, bad news for the Fed, job openings in the US to 10.72 million in September. That's an increase from 10.28 million. And it's higher than about the 9.75 million that economists had been estimating. Why is that bad news for the Fed? They have been trying to put their foot on the brake pedal. Slow down the US economy to such an extent that inflation will fall. They do not want this hugely expansive job market that we have seen. And of course, we're getting another read on this on Friday when we get the monthly jobs reports. So, not only that, we also just got the ISM manufacturing survey. 50.2, 50.2 was the reading there. That's two tenths of a percentage point better than estimated prices paid, though. Here's a little glimmer of hope. Prices paid in the ISM manufacturing report, 46.6. So, below that 50 measure and much better than estimated, also below what it was the month before. New orders ticking up a little bit to 49.2 in that report. An employment ticking up as well. So, on balance, what is perhaps good news for the economy is perhaps bad news for the interest rate outlook. Yeah, and one huge thing, especially as you were mentioning, employment that sticks out to me a moment ago as we were thinking about where the key areas are for us going into this monthly jobs report on Friday to keep a close eye on where we were still seeing some actual tick higher in notable job gains and leisure and hospitality and healthcare, where the other sectors are, where that starts to edge lower here as we've started to see some companies have inclination to actually pull some jobs off the table or more massively as we've heard right now in some of the hiring freezes. That largely shows up more in the Joltz data. And so, it's going to be interesting week for employment more broadly as a whole as we get some of that preliminary data kind of coming into what is going to be the big cajona of the mall, if you will, on Friday with the monthly jobs reporting employment situation. Yeah, it was just interesting, Julie. As soon as you were reporting that the Joltz study, so the market really tick lower. So, you almost have to, I think, be rooting for a not-so-good jobs report on Friday. But this data would suggest the data or that jobs report might come in pretty strong again. Yeah, it could do, which, again, we might not see a positive market reaction to your point. Absolutely. I'm taking a look at the markets here as, well, they're holding on to gains right now early on today's session. Shifting years here, just briefly, the three ships, three ships left Ukrainian ports under the Black Sea grain and back out in April, zorogase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,53,2022-11-01 17:33:51
4558," Well, they're holding on to gains right now, early on today's session. Shifting gears here are just briefly the three ships. Three ships left Ukrainian ports under the Black Sea grain export deal today. In the second day of sailings after Russia suspended its participation, that's according to the initiatives United Nations-led coordination center. The bottleneck of ships waiting for Russian inspection, easing now that it is out of the operation. But the big question is, will that boost in grain flow hold? Back real finds, tech real funds president and CEO Sal Grivarate joins us now. Sal, great to speak with you as always. First and foremost, just a huge view of what's going on there. What is the need to know about the situation? Well, I think what people need to know is Russia pulling out. Actually, as you just mentioned, Brad, a sped up delivery. Yesterday, you had more ships and more grain tonnage basis leave Ukrainian ports than since the agreement started. So Russia was slowing things down, perhaps intentionally or not. But they were an impediment to grains flowing more freely. They are now flowing freely. You've got a lot of ships there trying to get out. They are loaded. You're going to see a burst of exports coming from Ukraine, which is much needed. Ukraine is well ahead of their core export pace from last year, which is interesting. They're behind but catching up on their wheat export pace. And you'll see a lot of ships leave there in the next several days. What moves forward is going to be tough. With Russia pulling out of the agreement, it runs a lot of risk. It's a wartime area. You will see insurance rates go up. You'll see shipping rates go up. You may see people avoiding sending their ships back into Ukraine to pick up more grain. That will be a problem. That said, Russia's got plenty of grain. You just have to go a little bit east in the black sea and you get to Russian ports. And you can pick up all the grain you want. But there are payment problems there. People are afraid to get into the payment system with Russia. There's a big slowdown and people are afraid their money will be inadvertently frozen. So it's not illegal to buy grain or fertilizer from Russia. But people are afraid to do it. It's now their supplier of last choice. Yet they are the world's largest holder of exportable supplies of both wheat and fertilizers. So talk to us out on balance and high, by the way. On balance, what is the supply demand equation look like as we go in, and particularly the supply look like as we go into the winter here? It sounds like still relatively well supplied, even with these threats from Russia. That's right. We are well supplied, but understand the global balance sheets are tightening. I think we've said this before and we've got confirmation from the USDA and their October report that this will be another year where the world produces a record amount of wheat. Yet we also will use more than we produce. So if you let that sink in, producing a record amount, yet it's not enough. That means global balance sheets over time are tightening. And the big issue for wheat is that if wheat backs up in Ukraine, if ships don't go back in there because we're in a wartime environment and Russia has pulled out of the deal, there's too much uncertainty now for ship owners and traders to go back in there. If we're in a wartime environment, if people aren't buying from Ukraine or from Russia for that matter. There are the sources of last resort, which they will be because of the risks involved in sending ships into the Black Sea. What you're going to do is back up supplies that are sitting there and you can only hold wheat for so long. It will go bad. Farmers have already planted this year's crop. They plant in the fall. This winter wheat. Apparently, Ukraine has planted 40 percent less. Russia probably has another record planting. But if we don't pull the wheat out of there in the next, say, six months to nine months, next year, when they go to plant, they may not plant as much. And with the global balance sheet tightening to have reduced wheat plant things is going to be a major problem moving forward next year to two or three. So I'll give in this environment what's the re through to consumer prices? I think that, again, we've spoken about this before. Energy has a bigger effect on your box of cereal, say, than does the actual price of the grain. But I think in terms of overall consumer prices, you've got to floor on the wholesale price of grain. The cost of production is higher. And right now, there's too much uncertainty in the world and too much of a tightening balance sheet for grains to go back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,54,2022-11-01 17:38:10
4559," on the wholesale price of grain, the cost of production is higher. And right now, there's too much uncertainty in the world, and too much of a tightening balance sheet for grains to go back to their old levels that we saw say two years ago, where we were at cost of production. You've got an underlying floor on grains. And China appears to be short food. They're importing, they're buying, they're selling wheat out of their stocks, and sometimes they only sell certain percentage. They sold 100% of that wheat this week that they offered. China may be locking their people down because of commodity, particularly food shortages in different areas. It could be a problem. So between China and the supply issues and risk issues in the Black Sea and China's demand, global supplies of grain are going to continue to tighten in the future here. To create on funds, president and CEO, Sal Gilberti. Thanks so much as always for that inside and prospective Sal, appreciate it. Pleasure. Everyone, shifting gears and taking a look at the major averages here as we are about 38 minutes into today's trading session. Let me pop out of there real quick and give it on us over to the US major averages. The Dow Jones industrial average is actually slipped into negative territory. That's now down by about a quarter of a percent. And we'll take a look at the intraday chart here. There you can see we started off higher on the day but have taken a bit of a nose dive here to the downside. And the NASDAQ composite, that too. Also now a negative territory flat but to the downside. Right now about seven points in the red. But you can see the move that's really taking place there on the far left side of your screen. And then the S&P 500 also flat but to the downside. But again, same case there, about 10 AM. We got some economic data that poured in and so the market's starting to react to that. But I also want to take a look at some movers that we've got here on the day. And particularly, there is one mover that I want to zero in on. And it comes in the form of Activision Blizzard. I'm just going to locate their ticker symbol very quickly here. It's up by about 1.2%. And also keep an eye on Microsoft shares with regards to a ton of news that's coming out from the companies today, particularly around the review of this acquisition. Of course, the EU is set to conclude their review of this on November 8th. And it seems that the latest out of this review is that considering Sony was said to be worried about Call of Duty here. That the EU has not had any concessions received from Microsoft there. So it seems like the review is going to move forward. Activision shares reacting positively here. Microsoft shares they were holding onto gains earlier in today's session. But we've seen a lot of movement take place as well as we're going on throughout the rest of today's trading activity. Also some new Call of Duty stats that came out today. I'll share those on my Twitter later on. All right, I'm ready for the retweet. Always a big game. All right, before we head to break, we're keeping a close eye on Airbnb. Head of its earnings do out after the close today. Evercore ISI analyst, Mark Mahaney. He's reiterating an outperform rating into the print, says Manie. You see, upside to these streets, Q3 gross bookings, revenue and nights estimates given overall positive trends from third party data such as TSA throughput. Worth noting here, Airbnb has been among the top printing tickers on the Alphine's platform among or over the past 12 hours or so. Coming up, crypto is taking a stake in Twitter.

A federal judge has blocked Penguin Random House from buying rival publishers Simon and Schuster. That deal would have been worth $2.18 billion and would have joined together two of the five largest book publishers in the U.S. Biden administration had argued that the acquisition would hurt competition for publishing rights to top selling books and the judge agreed. Penguin Random House owner Bertels Minz has a will appeal the ruling it's on the hook for a $200 million fee to Simon and Schuster's owner Paramount Globbel if the deal, indeed ultimately does not go through. Pilots of Delta Airlines are calling for a strike unless an agreement can be reached between the Pilots Union and Delta. The headlines are continuing with the union saying it's still driving to an agreement and the airline saying progress has been made. The news comes as airlines overall struggle with labor negotiations, particularly in the wake of COVID. And Johnson and Johnson, a Johnson announcing it will buy a biomed which makes heart pumps designed to help treat heart conditions in a $16.6 billion all cash deal. That buy will add to Johnson and Johnson's medical device portfolio, including contact lenses and implants, all this is the company's bulk of its medical device offerings. It plans to eventually separate its consumer facing brands like Band-Aid and Tylenol into a new independent company. And the Supreme Court temporarily blocked Congress from obtaining former President Trump's income tax returns from the IRS. That decision by Chief Justice John Roberts came a day after Trump's lawyers filed an emergency application seeking that delay. A federal judge had previously ordered the IRS to hand over the tax returns to the committee, which has said it wants them as part of a probe of how the agency audits presidential tax returns. South? Cryptocurrency exchange finance, helping to fund Elon Musk's deal for Twitter to tune a $500 million. Finance says it hopes to help Twitter buy better and corporate crypto into the platform. Here to talk about that prospect, Chang Peng, Zhao, Founder and CEO of Finance and our very own crypto reporter David Holler. It's easy, always good to see you. Thanks for giving us some time here. Is this more of a bet on Elon Musk or more of a bet on the future of Twitter's platform? I think to be honest, it's a bit of both. I think first of all, we want to sports free speech. And this is one of the best choices, best chances to do that. Elon Musk is a very strong entrepreneur. We want to support him too. And crypto, Twitter is a ton square for crypto and most of the worst hard topics. So it's a good place to support free speech. And CZ, Elon Musk has gone back and forth, at least, from what we've seen in court documents that showed his text messages. He was initially talking about doing sort of a blockchain.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,56,2022-11-01 17:46:59
4561," Elon Musk has gone back and forth, at least, from what we've seen in court documents that showed his text messages. He was initially talking about doing a blockchain Twitter to improve some of the problems he's laid out for the company. And then he also has said that maybe that's not possible. Maybe it just won't work. And I'm curious at this juncture, what you're thinking about a crypto implementation or Twitter might look like and how realistic you think it is. I think Twitter today is a centralized platform. So moving that in one giant step into a fully decentralized platform is going to be quite difficult. I think we've got to get there in incremental steps. And for any entrepreneur or any company in today's environment, we've got to make many adjustments as time goes on. So it's very natural for his stock process to change over time. But overall, Elon is a very strong entrepreneur, and we want to support him. So Elon has been making some strategic moves with regard to who he's placing within Twitter, who he's bringing over from Tesla into the new Twitter that he sees moving forward. He's even said previously that the Twitter board that he decides to put together won't be paid if he was successful in acquiring the company. Post acquisition and knowing how much you believe that Twitter could improve with some of the same technology that Binance already has, perhaps, and the same ethos as well. Is this a position that you would want on Twitter's board? I'm not against it, but I'm also not actively pursuing it. I'm not very good sitting on boards. I don't enjoy those topics, like long meetings, et cetera. But if my help is needed, I'm happy to. But I'm pretty busy running Binance. We want to give all the support we can. But we'll see what Elon decides. Speaking of sticking to your knitting and running Binance, I mean, we see obviously Elon Musk who is running a couple other companies. Now he's sort of doing Twitter. And the initial reports coming out, frankly, have the feel of throwing spaghetti against the wall, as we say. In other words, maybe we'll charge people for the checkmarks. Maybe we'll take away free ads from Twitter blue. Like there's all this stuff sort of sort of trickling out. It doesn't feel like there is a unified strategy coming from Musk right now at Twitter. Has an investor, and as a user, what do you want to see? So I think that's very, very normal. As an investor, as a user, and also a fellow entrepreneur, I think it's very common to have many different ideas and see what sticks. So it's really literally throwing spaghetti on the wall and just hope something sticks. That's entrepreneurship. So many different ideas should be tried and should be tried quickly. I think as a user, my biggest problem with Twitter is over the last year or a couple years, there hasn't been a lot of new features being introduced. There should be new features every month, every week, every day. And we just see what sticks. That's very normal. Like what's easy? What would be the thing that you would want to see from Twitter in terms of a new feature? I actually agree with a lot of what Elon's idea is, edit button. The way the list blocks spam bots, there's a lot of bots that spammy my comments section when I open my tweets for comments. And blue ticks, they should become more, they should be a cost to it. I actually really support that idea. So all of this shouldn't really take more than a week to implement each. So we should have done that like a year ago. So I'm very supportive of Elon's idea. Let's move quickly. Let's try new ideas. Yeah, to that point too, as one of the largest benefactors of cryptocurrency trading volume, thinking of this whole bot situation, there are, we know from the crypto side of Twitter that there are plenty of accounts that share coins and pump the price and things like that. So I'm curious, given that you're also thinking about the free speech mentality on Twitter, how do you think that problem is solved now that you have a financial stake? I think there's a balance between free speech and also pump and dump marketing manipulation, hate speech, just or just pure lying or fake information. So there has to be a line to be drawn. It's not an easy problem to solve to be honest, and also hurts so that they move. You can go to post my blocky page,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,57,2022-11-01 17:51:11
4562," hate speech, just or just pure lying or fake information. So there has to be a line that to be drawn. It's not an easy problem to solve to be honest, but I think Elon's a much better position to solve that problem than the look to this being currently. There's too many spam boss on Twitter today. And so with regard to the hate speech, though, do you think that there is a significant policy change that needs to be enacted in order to make sure that that is removed from the platform that it is not just a place for free speech, but also a place where free speech is not convoluted with hate speech on the platform. I think that's a very fine line to draw. It's going to be tricky. I think between hate speech and free speech, that's a very fine line. But some of the other stuff are much more clear. Fake news, spam, spam, much easier. Yeah. So, you see, one part of making a good return on investment like this is Elon running an effective business, whether it's sales or profits. Do you support him laying off 75% of that Twitter workforce to get those profits? I think there's two different things. I think laying off a portion of the staff is just to become more efficient. Twitter today doesn't have a very strong business model, but it could potentially have very strong business models. So, I think those two things are separate. It's not to say, I think revenue is not by saving cost. Not revenue doesn't come from saving cost. That's, I think Twitter's ability to generate revenue five seats that is cost center today. There's many new revenue models that can be implemented on Twitter, like charging for blue ticks, even charging procurement, issue NFTs for each tweet, issue on token in the future. So, all of those things can generate revenue for Twitter and it's not limited by the cost savings. I happen to think charging for blue checks is a really bad idea, but we'll take that offline. CZ, I'm discussing another time, finance CEO. CZ, always good to catch up with you along with Yahoo! Finances, David Holler. I appreciate it, guys. Coming up, retail roundup. We'll speak with Bank of America's Lorraine Hutchinson on her top retail picks for holiday season that's shaping up to be a lot weaker than last year's. We'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,58,2022-11-01 17:55:35

Bank of America Retail is a huge increase in the number of high-level prices that are out there from rising prices for things you need. So you have less to spend on things that you want. So talk to us about the holiday season and how all of this plays out. Do you expect people to be buying fewer things or less expensive things or all of the above? Thanks, good morning. Our holiday forecast calls for just over 1% sales growth. We do expect people to be using their money more frugally given the pressures they're facing on the non-discretionary parts of their budget. What we're also expecting is on the discretionary side, a lot of their money has been used this year on vacations, eating out, things we couldn't necessarily do a lot of last year. So it makes for a little bit of a tougher holiday for the consumer. We would expect them to be much more focused on value and much more focused on value and much more focused on value and much more focused on looking for deals this holiday season. Does that signal that household balance sheets are not healthy as some banks have told us this early season? Look, our, you know, RBC, Core Data and the work of our institutes says that the balance sheets still are healthy. It's just a little, we've seen a little bit of pullback and spending in September. And we think that that bodes poorly for the interest in really spending up this holiday season. So we think the consumer's still in good shape, just a little bit more cautious than last year and allocating their dollars to different things. Lorraine, one key problem in retail, head of this holiday season, we were just showing the chart on inventory growth. The retail industry is a wash in inventory. There is a lot of discounting in this environment who sees the biggest gross profit margin pressure, operating margin pressure, and who's at risk of, you know, coming out in early January and issuing a major earnings warning? Yeah, look, we have earnings coming up for retail. We think that they will issue pretty cautious outlooks for 4Q because retail inventories are at all time record highs. Now, some of this is because they brought in inventory early. Remember last year the shelves were bare. They stocked out of a lot of goods. So they wanted to make sure they were in stock. But a portion of it is also, they were forecasting demand that just hasn't materialized. So we've seen the consumer take a little bit of a step back in mid-June, and then we've seen some slowing since then in September. So we think there is too much. Where we see the biggest risk, or those retailers targeting the lower income consumer, you've seen excess inventory levels at retailers like Old Navy, like Coles, where the consumer is just, it's just a little bit tighter on the good news side. Who cleans up those messes? The off-priced retailers. They really thrive on problems with the inventory and excess thereof. So we think that retailers like TJ Maxx, Burlington, Rostor, will be getting a tremendous amount of really high quality, well-branded inventory, really starting this quarter. The rain, that's the glass half full part of the equation. I want to go back to the glass half empty part of the equation because we all have been getting the sort of increasingly desperate emails from some of the retailers offering heavy discounting. Some of the retailers, the big guys like Target and Walmart, they've said we're really addressing this inventory buildup. But across the board in retail, do you think that the inventory glut is going to get worse before it gets better? Is the discounting working to work off that inventory? So we expect the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,59,2022-11-01 17:59:55
4564," inventory, glut is going to get worse before it gets better. Are is the discounting working to work off that inventory? So, we expect the mismatch between supply and demand to peak in the fourth quarter. So, we do think holiday will be very promotional. You will get some great deals and that'll help us stretch to consumer. We do expect, though, that as we hit the end of the fourth quarter, so for retail, that's end of January, that they will have worked through it. We think January will be a very heavy clearance period, as most of the retailers are laser focused on exiting the winter season with appropriate levels. When we look to the first half of fiscal 2023, most retailers already had a chance to cut orders. So, when spending pulled back a little bit in June and July, most retailers called their factories and their partners and told them to make less. They cut, they canceled, and so we do see some improvement in that in the first half of 23. Now, that doesn't mean that they'll be pristine, but versus 4Q, we think they'll be in much better shape. All right, one of your top picks is Starbucks. Now, there's this new CEO getting ready to take the helm there. Have you met with him? Have you talked to him about his plan for the company looking out over the next few years? So, Starbucks is actually covered by one of my colleagues. It was one of our top holiday picks in my sector. My top holiday pick is Tapestry, which owns coach and Kate's paid. Well, to give us more details on this, is do you think in general that the higher-end consumer is going to be more resilient here? And that's why you like Tapestry? Or do you think Tapestry is doing something in particular, right, even in the luxury universe? I think a little bit of both, actually. You know, we think Tapestry is one of the few retailers that really did transform during the pandemic. And they took a few actions that we think are really important for the staying power of their earnings. They cut a lot of costs and reinvested those in marketing. They eliminated the bottom 40% of their styles to make their assortment more efficient. And they also added an e-commerce business to their outlet business, which we think added a new customer, a younger customer. So those things combined to give us more confidence in the sustainability of their high-teens margins. And with those high-teens margins, come great cash flow. So we're expecting Tapestry to buy back 7% of its stock and pay a 3% yield every year. And given the stock is near-troth multiples at five times EBITDA, we think that sets up really nicely into holiday and into 2023. New customer, younger customer, it me, buying gifts out here. Thank you for America, retail analyst Lorraine Hutchinson. Appreciate the time and the conversation is always. Thanks. Coming up, everyone, sort of being through earnings season, we've got some more auto-mubers on Tapestry. But earnings reports from Get This, Avis, good, your tire and rubber.

4565," here in the the company commenting on this in the statement saying we face many ongoing challenges in the quarter including persistent inflation At the same time new challenges emerged including a less certain outlook in Europe and the effects of a stronger US dollar. I tweeted this last night I'm shocked by now this stock is trading at about a 45% discount to book value That is just tremendous not something you see historically in the market but not historically you see with a name like a good year in a leadership position in the tire market but maybe some simple analysis will help here looks like they just push through higher prices and their volumes are starting to take a hit. You know anecdotally I was pricing some new tires for my car over $1200 for four new tires. I have gone crazy they have gone crazy crazy now you need them but still do you need good years. Yeah I don't know that I'm sure that that seems it's expensive though. Do you put the same fancy tires on your car that you put the fancy gas in your car that maybe you don't really do you need to ask I'm not getting cheap tires. You're probably going cheap tires. You're probably going run flats right. Yes for this car yes run flats yes exactly. I even know what that means. Oh keeps going essentially if you get a if you get a nail in or something you could probably go for what 50 more miles. Oh why? We actually have to service run flats. Yes all right well let's let's say on cars here shares of Kavanaugh are ripping higher up about 17% this morning after the use car retailer got an upgrade from underway to neutral over JP Morgan saying investors have digested the risks around the stock. Kavanaugh has become one of the most hated stocks on Wall Street Wall Street hates this stock and so it is surprising to see this upgrade. I think the overall gist of JP Morgan here is that our Kavanaugh may not need to raise capital in the near term and that is triggering their credit. Yeah look at the stock performance year to date now down 93% and you know even as we're continuing to watch how investors are evaluating carbon this does come back to the same conversation of about the we were having with automation a moment ago about what the depreciation of some of the inventory looks like getting inventory that they're actually going to be able to sell through as well and at what price consumers are actually going to take price and kind of move some of those vehicles off the lot especially at a time where there's a shift in the sentiment or at least in going towards some of the more electrified models and we're seeing that we've seen that show up early in car car vanes numbers earlier this year car mics has reported on the success that they've seen with regards to some of their EV sales even as you're starting to see the early churn in adoption there or a churn that is moving more of those vehicles into a car vana landscape at least. Want to make a bad financial decision by a used Tesla with 60,000 miles on it from car vana I mean that just has all the makings of potential battery just not going well but let's look at the markets here let's do a quick market check we're seeing the markets really come off a little bit today you know earlier in the show we're talking about a little bit hotter than expected a Joltz report ISM coming in recently well perhaps the Fed not liking to see that they'll have to stay a little bit further along on their rate hikes but right now we're seeing all three major indices in the red.

It also helps from a profit perspective that chicken wing prices have star two or they have flown lower. Let's check in with Winx Stop CEO, Michael Skipper. Mike, good to see you. As always, last time we talked to you guys were really one of the first restaurants to call out deflation. Are you still seeing those deflationary prices and how long do you think will last? Brian, we are. We're enjoying meaningful deflation in our business today. Just as we wore back when we spoke a quarter ago and as we look at some of these leading indicators around our overall supply chain, it seems to suggest a backdrop of continued favorability from a commodity perspective for the balance of 2022 and into the beginning of 2023. A lot of new menu items that you've rolled out over the course of this year, Michael, how do you continue to kind of look through some of the performance indicators and in different markets as you kind of continue to look through the menu and what consumers even regardless of pricing, what they're gravitating towards right now. Yeah, Winx Stop is in a really unique spot in that in the second quarter our business was hit with the perfect storm and we were able to lean into a proven value playbook as well as pull some unique growth levers that we have as a brand and one of those being leading into menu innovation and introducing chicken sandwich to consumers out there. First time we've done that as a brand and we think that's a meaningful long term sustaining a sales driver for our business and just launching that along with some of the other levers we pulled translated to a 6.9% Sam Store sales growth in the third quarter and what's really great about that growth is the majority of that came with transaction growth. I think we've talked to you about this last time, Michael, with the prices, the raw material prices coming down for you guys. I don't imagine your cutting prices for consumers but I imagine maybe you're keeping them steady. How long do you do you, I mean, for the foreseeable future do you think we'll see some stability there? We've talked about the unique spot we're in this year where we haven't had to take any price where the rest of the industry to manage their margins has had to take meaningful price this year and you're seeing that start to impact some of the transactions in their business and we've been able to lean into that value playbook and not necessarily take any price this year and present consumers with meaningful value so that they can enjoy that indulgent wingsdop occasion. Michael, my team year doesn't think I watched football but I in fact do and I was watching football and I've seen you guys start to pop up on TV. Are you getting return on that investment in the NFL and what does it look like? We are Brian. We're seeing a meaningful increase in our investment and advertising this year, the back half of this year we're increasing our investment over 30.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,62,2022-11-01 18:16:27
4567," We are Brian, we're seeing a meaningful increase in our investment and advertising this year. The back half of this year we're increasing our investment over 35% and you're seeing as you mentioned show up in a big way in NFL as well as the NBA that's just kicked off in live sports and that's helping us close the gap that we have in brand awareness to other national brands that are out there. And again another one of those multiple sales driving levers that we have that give us confidence in our ability to deliver our 19th consecutive year of same-store sales growth this year. Are people coming in store are they ordering through digital app? What is that touch point especially when you think about that customer acquisition cost and the awareness generation that you're ramping up right now? Yeah, we stopped spending industry leader from an investment in digital and we had a really strong digital business before the pandemic hit and then obviously we saw explosive growth during the pandemic in our digital business already a business that was heavy off premise over the last three years through the third quarter we've seen ourselves grow north of 36% and that digital business that I referenced is over 60% of our business today and that's a stickiness that we've been able to really hold since consumers have started to normalize their behavior a little bit to pre-pandemic behaviors but those digital customers that we've brought into our brand we've been able to hold on to them and continue to build from there. Michael good to see you thanks for stopping by Michael Skip where the Wingstop CEO and president well from chicken wings to your Thanksgiving turkey the Thanksgiving dinners about to take an even bigger bite out of your wallet this year with the cost expected to rise by nearly 15% over last Thanksgiving that's according to a new report from Wells Fargo out just this morning now who finances Brook to Palma is here with the details so what's getting where are we seeing prices go the most higher for the various Thanksgiving components Brook. Julie well first let's start with the star of the show of course that is the turkey the turkey is expected to be cost rather 23% more than this exact time last year and that's according to the US DA of course here we're looking at frozen which is what most consumers get this time of year for frozen whole hand customers can expect to spend a dollar 64 per pound now that's for an 8 to 16 pound hand of course larger families going for those 20 plus pound hand so it certainly does add up of course this time of year we're also taking a look at some stocks behind turkeys we have cornmouth foods behind Jenny oh and obligate farms of course seaboard also owns a stake in butterball but according to Brad Ruben of Wells Fargo he told Young who financed that if you're open to the idea of not doing a turkey this year this may be the right year to do it price of chicken up 17% pork up 6.7% but overall the entire Thanksgiving basket is expected to cost more of course this past year we've seen eggs butter flour fruits and veggies really go up in price of course those help create most of the Thanksgiving meal but consumers can also expect higher prices on two key items fresh berries this year due to weather conditions and higher impact costs those will likely cost more so Wells Fargo suggesting here to look at canned or frozen berries also potato crop was a bit smaller this year I farms across the US where sweet potatoes of course different than regular potatoes these from us potatoes this might be the year to see some vast sweet potatoes those have a surplus this year and so those can be a more budget friendly option hey bro I haven't figured out what I'm doing for Thanksgiving yet but should I just eat out is it cheaper to do it well that's something that Wells Fargo also looked into they did say that for perhaps a smaller group of people where a dining out seems like a bit of a luxury it actually might make of more financial sense here they pull data from the Bureau of Labor sticks it's of course we've been following those stats so from November to August of 2021 the cost of a Thanksgiving basket at home was up 14.9% but the cost of food away from home so dining at a restaurant only up roughly 6% so Brian if you're looking to skip that prep skip the cleanup and also take away the hassle of Thanksgiving dining out maybe an option they're seeing stronger value there instead of eating at home all right music and use for broke exactly",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,63,2022-11-01 18:20:34

Exactly. All right, we gotta get you hooked up too. I think we know. I hope you have a place to be, bro, Brooke. I look, I do. I've got plenty of force and knives ready for you, just for you, Brian Sazzi. I can almost feel the post-prandial, so I'm in the lunch coming on now, aka theitis. Brooke Sazzi. You did it again. I did it again. Brooke the bum of my gosh. You did it again. You did it again. You did it again. Okay, all right. Brooke DiPoma, Yahoo Finance's own. Thanks so much for joining us with the news about Turkey. Coming up, Herbalife. Yeah, it's down right now, half percent. After the company pulled its guidance and announced the leadership change, let's nice. She's gonna release it. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. Welcome back everyone. Cypher Cut the Times, three stories, one minute each. We start with this on the day. Herbalife Nutrition has renamed Michael Johnson as Chairman and interim CEO following news that Chief Executive John Aguanobe would be stepping down. Johnson has already served as CEO from Herbalife from 2003 to 2017 and from 2019 to early 2020. The company also announced it is withdrawing its full year 2022 guidance and will periodically reassess when they believe future performance can be reasonably estimated. All right, the return of the CEO call to come back. Yeah, talk about everything you don't want to see in an earnings release. Your CEO essentially kicked out, you have no guidance. I covered this company way back when Bill Lackman said it was going to go to zero and famously shorted it. He ended up throwing in the towel on that eventually. Carl, I can't remember had taken the other side of that trade. And honestly, after a while, I stopped paying attention to it because it did that. It's been going down now for a couple of years and so it didn't go to zero..",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,64,2022-11-01 18:25:16
4569," After a while, I stopped paying attention to it because it did that. It's been going down now for a couple of years and so it didn't go to zero. But it's a smaller company than it was. But it's a multi-level marketing nutrition company. I could talk for a long time. I'll leave it. It's all protein bars. And checking out on Mulsing Core is beverage company shares. In focus, falling a beat on Q3 revenue is net sales grew 4%. The beer maker also reaffirmed its full-year outlook as it continues to navigate the higher cost environment. And overall global inflation pressures. These in quarter from Mulsing Core, I wouldn't say it was as good as what we heard from AB Inbef earlier in the week. And then even what we heard from Constellation Brands a couple weeks ago. But I do like the fact that Mulsing Core is putting core's light in Miller Light and Cores Bank, which is in the premium beer category. I enjoy all those beers and they taste very premium in my humble view. I didn't get as deep into this one, but did they say anything about where the consumer tastes might be changing or shifting? Because I mean, liakers, wines or wines and spirits rather. That has been something that I think consumers gravitated towards during the pandemic. And then we saw kind of a little bit of a move away from that and towards some of the new canned cocktails as well here. Yeah, ready to drink. I mean, that's been one of the biggest drivers of the whole industry. Wait to that. New Jack and Coke. In a can comes out from Coca-Cola in the first part next year. That could be pretty big. That's innovation in this fine form. It's not already out? Not out. It's launching a little bit in Mexico, but soon in the US early next year. I'll fake one then. All right. Speaking of returns, could we see the return of Vine Twitter's new owner, Elon Musk, reportedly is thinking about bringing back the short for video app the Twitter had bought and abandoned. He tweeted out of poll yesterday asking users if they thought he should bring back Vine 69% of the near five million voters say yes. They want Vine back in App Store. I know that sauce is a big fan of this. Big. I'm sort of agnostic on Vine. I like Vine. This set me back to some of the Vines I posted in 2014. They are out there on the internet. And why I liked it. And I remember it was just simple to use. You put your finger on the button and you make a Vine. It wasn't as complicated as with TikTok. Instagram is okay, but Vine, which is very simple and very intuitive. But why would it be a separate thing if it's acquiring Twitter? Of course, yeah. You could have a separate app experience, but why not fold it into the same app and be able to just have similar to what Instagram has with a different button for Reels. Just have that for Vine within the same Twitter experience. Like I said, Spedgetting against the law, people. But according to CC, that's how you do it when you're not your prernor. Thank you to Binance, tweeting out our article, really blowing up there on Twitter. Sure. Okay, we're going to leave it there. Let's take a look at Stocks, shall we? Because we started things out today higher and now we are seeing Stocks lower. And Blame it on the economic data that we got at 10 a.m. Which was stronger than estimated, more job openings, more manufacturing activity. Bad news, perhaps, for the Fed's supposed coming sometime pivot, sometime. Let's go get that course, like, let's do it up. All right, we're good. I'm in. All right, coming up, Brian Sondi. He's going to join Jarrett Blickery to speak with the SOFI CEO Anthony Noto, as he mentioned. On the back of that company's earnings report, you don't want to miss it. Happy Tuesday, everybody. Who got it? Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,65,2022-11-01 18:29:14
4570," Now visit the Welcome to Yahoo Finance. It's 11 a.m. in New York. I'm Jared Blyckery in for a Kiko Fajita. And here's what I am watching today. Uber shares accelerating to the upside, the ride sharing and delivery company reporting a bigger than expected third quarter loss, but revenue clocking in higher than Wall Street estimates. We're going to be breaking down those numbers for you. And so far is surging. The Fintech company boosting its outlook reporting stronger than expected third quarter earnings. So far CEO Anthony Noto will join us later in the hour and Musk's Twitter takeover. Elon is reportedly bringing more than 50 Tesla employees to help build his vision for Twitter, but at what cost to Tesla? We have all the details coming up. But first, first we're going to take a look at the stocks and we can see Dow's down to about 188 points, S&P 500 and the NASDAQ are each down about half a percent. And if we take a look at the bond market, we're seeing yields across the curve a little bit depressed right now except for the 13 week two bill yield. That's not shown on your screen. However, we do have that eclipsing to the upside of the 10 year TBL to yield of 4.04%. We're going to be talking about that with a number of analysts in a second. And now we are taking a look at some of the latest corporate earnings starting with Uber. The ride sharing company surging after beating revenue estimates in the third quarter and delivering adjusted EBITDA well above its guidance here to break down all of this. And more is Yavu Finance's prize Supermanian and Angelique Kimlani. So give us a skinny on Uber here. Yeah, so you know, very strong quarter here, the revenue beat up $8.3 billion, up 70% compared to a year ago. They missed on the adjusted EPS loss here, but I kind of invested shaking that off. I mean, this is a strong quarter overall with like a lot of their side businesses too. CEO Darik Kaza Shawi said in the statement quote, our global scale and unique platform advantages are working together to drive more profitable growth with growth, growth of 32% record adjusted EBITDA 516 million. So they guided that adjusted EBITDA at 600 to 630 million next quarter. Also a guided growth booking to jump 23 to 27% versus a year ago. So strong, strong, strong kind of numbers there. And also driver supply. We're seeing that up 70% in a year over a year. So that's good for them. Now we have that Department of Labor, Labor, Rule potentially coming on a classifying gig workers as a full time. We'll see if that goes through, but that's kind of an overhang there. But so far, so good for enough, Uber. And what about some of its competitors? We're expecting results from lift and the likes of door dash and there are also subject to that same potential regulation. Right, excuse me, rules coming down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,66,2022-11-01 18:33:45
4571," There's were expected results from lift and the likes of door dash and there are also subject to that same potential regulation of law. Excuse me, rules coming down with respect to those gig employees. You know, I think that they're not as well situated, especially it lifts compared to Uber because Uber has, look at this, mobility bookings of 13.7 billion, delivery bookings of 13.7 billion, freight bookings almost two billion last quarter. These are all like delivery and freight or side businesses that lift just doesn't have. Uber is also international and they also have a car rental sort of service with a color partner. So Uber is just way more broader in terms of their offerings and they're able to sort of weather this storm of any kind of macro headwinds, but also, I mean, just popularity of mobility right now, a bright share and also delivery is huge. Yeah, I got to tell you, I'm still waiting for the price that's coming down across the board after just surging like mad over the last year, year and a half here. But we want to ship to the healthcare sector where we're looking at Pfizer. They topped estimates in the latest quarter and, Anjali, what can you tell us about these earnings? Well, first let's start off with Pfizer because that is just a very interesting story down on revenue, but beating estimates and definitely a little bit of attention still on their COVID products, really updating the guidance through the end of the year based on the vaccine as well as the treatment packs. They outlook a 22 billion, but Comronatty, the vaccine up to billion to 34 billion. And that is still based, of course, on government purchase. The company is looking to pivot to the private market next year, but still a lot there. And the company knows that it is really under the watchful I have investors right now looking to see what it can do outside of the COVID platform. We got comments from the Pfizer CEO, Albert Borla saying what we recognize that some are questioning Pfizer's longer term growth prospects, particularly in the 2025 to 2030 timeframe. That is based on some patent clips that the company is facing. They're currently expecting a negative impact of approximately 17 billion in revenue from that, but we did hear of course about some of the recent acquisitions and the potential to fill that got based on those acquisitions. So that's where things stand for the company right now. Really interesting quarter, really strong quarter. And that's sort of the story for the company as it seems. All right. Well, how about the story behind Eli Lilly? I believe this company is coming off record highs, but it is suffering about a down day today off about 5.4% as you can see on your screen there. It did completely opposite story there where they shifted guidance downwards for the end of the year, also looking at a hit from the stronger dollar, about 300 million there. The company also has had an interesting story when it comes to a strong COVID product and platform. The monoclonal antibody from Eli Lilly is one of the only ones remaining that has any kind of protection against new variants. So that's one positive there for the company. They also have a new diabetes drug that's been looked at for weight loss as well. And so there's a strong demand for that product and that's where some of the strength comes from that company right now. All right. Thank you for those earnings reports, pro supermanian and angelic kimlani. Now, turning to a broader look at the market, US job openings rose to 10.7 million of September. Surprise into the upside and indicating the hot labor market is not cooling us quickly as a Fed may have hoped. Join us now is Guaralfe Malik, state street global advisors, chief investment strategist. Thank you for joining us here today. Just want to get your take on what you think the FOMC, the Fed, has us, has in store for us when it announces its decision Wednesday and then what we might expect in that chair presser later on that afternoon. I don't think we should expect any surprise from the Fed. So I think 75 basis points as advertised. I suspect they will focus their attention more on being data dependent. I think that will be a very reasonable part to take. Because there is still a couple of brands to go between now and yet end. And I think the pricing of about a terminal rate of 4.75 to 5 now seems in line with expectation. So I don't think there's any surprise to expect from the Fed. I think the challenge for them is going to be the straight-off between inflation and growth. But the focus is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,67,2022-11-01 18:37:53
4572," If now seems in line with expectations. So I don't think there's any surprise to expect from the Fed. I think the challenge for them is going to be the straight up between inflation and growth. So the focus is very much on what I would call spot numbers. So what's going to occur with the CPI? Whereas some of the leading indicators beginning to indicate a slow down. The layup picture, of course, creates a separate complication for the Fed. And let me ask you about the yield curve here. Because as I indicated at the top of the show, the 13-week T-billion yield climbing across 4% for the first time since I believe 2007 at, according to CBO data. I'm just wondering what this is. This is the inversion that the Fed is really paying attention to when the 13-week on the short end rises above the 10-yield on the long end. And that is happening, as we speak. What are the implications for this? I mean, generally, when you think about a clearly Fed is focused on this. But generally, when you think about inversion, in our experience, you're looking at past recessions. And as you think about recession activity, I think the 10s do is what matters a bit more. We generally see flatting starting to occur about 3 to 5 quarters after the first hikes. So if you think about March, that would suggest to us that maybe we start thinking about flatting some point that I'm occurring in, call it Q2 of next year, the Q1 Q2 of next year, which may set us up for Fed talking about perhaps growth concerns and maybe about rate cuts towards the end of the year. So that's, I think, how we're seeing display out over the next several months. And I got to ask you about two of the major headwinds that markets have faced this year. One is the strong US dollar taking a little bit of a breather recently. And the other is China. We know that the Chinese stocks took a huge hit this year. And part of that is their idiosyncratic story with respect to President Xi taking on a third term over the year. But what is a strong dollar in weak China mean for you and any potential inflections there that you see on the horizon? Yeah, I mean, I think that one is that, I mean, I get it, that there was quite a lot of negative reactions from the conference. I think our approach is let's wait and see, sort of like the news that came out today a little bit about that maybe there's COVID relaxations. We do see signs that maybe that is the bot that the Chinese authorities will take. I think if you look at the dollar and playing sort of throwing China in the bigs, there's two supports for the dollar. One is the caddy trade. We know that big some point in time between now and say Q1 of next year. And the other one is the growth trade off. That US is removed from Russia, Ukraine issues. Energy is a lesser of a concern than other parts of the world. But the Fed is focused squarely on bringing down down growth in the US. Conversely, in China's case, there's only upside, right? I mean, we're probably going to see somewhat near tough growth as we look at this year from last time. By that somewhere between three to three and a half. Next year, we do see prospects of both fiscal easing. We see prospects for COVID reopening. That gives a chance to say that perhaps Chinese growth is a prize on the upside. We have that pegged about four and a half to five as we look at next year. I think that growth differential matters a lot, because as investors have spoken, the growth differential, perhaps we start seeing a peak and maybe even a decline in the dollar, which should be positive for non-US assets. That would be Europe and, of course, EM and China, that will complex, tends to benefit with that trade. So it's definitely worth much attention to what occurs in China. And we just encourage people to wait and see what actions get taken rather than just the rhetoric. Well, we're going to have to leave it there. But we thank you for your insights here. Guadalph Malik, State Street Global Advisors, Chief Investment Strategist. Well, we just talked to Uber earnings. We got to talk door dash. Those shares getting a boost, thanks to Uber's strong third quarter report. Door dash shares have been battered this year. US emerges from the COVID pandemic as an investor caution on consumer spending grows. The delivery service releases its third quarter results after the bill on Thursday. Analysts are expecting a loss of $0.7 per share on revenue of $1.6 billion. Now, coming up after this, the Fed has begun the first day of its two-day meeting. We'll discuss their plans for interest rates and what those might be up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,68,2022-11-01 18:42:13

4574," upside like Joltz today, manufacturing today, we could get another 75 basis points in December, but it also could be 50, it could be 25. So let me get this straight, 75, 50 or 25. Didn't hear 100 in there, so maybe that's good news for stocks, which could be bad news for stocks. So the way we interpret these things is well, but what about that pivot? We've been talking about that, is it's something that seems a little bit more distant often to the future in actual pivot, but maybe just a little bit of softening is what the market is expected. Yes, so the consensus is that they'll start discussions about a pivot in 2023, and at least about slowing the pace of hikes, but Wall Street keeps pushing back against this idea that a pivot is imminent. We have the big bang, certainly pushing against that idea. A Goldman Sachs, even though it's projecting a 50 basis point hike in December, actually raised its forecast to another 25 basis point increase. So we're looking at 50 in December, 25 in February, and 25 in March, in addition to that 75 point hike tomorrow. It actually raised its federal funds forecast to up to 5%, Bank of America, JP Morgan, also saying that the Fed won't pivot until into 2023. And this is because the reality is inflation is still high. It's well above the Fed's target of 2%, we still got that 8.2% figure in the CPI print. We certainly do, we got some more figures ahead, but everybody, stay tuned. We're gonna bring this to you live tomorrow in about 26 hours, something like that. I'll do the math tomorrow. All right, continuing this with the busy week and the job openings and labor turnover survey, also called Jolts, that was released this morning. Joining us now to break it all down is the labor market. On the labor market is Alice in Boxer. She is a US economist, economist for PIMCO, Alice, and thank you for joining us here today. We've been handicapping the Fed, and what might happen with that big decision tomorrow and the Powell Presser? Lots of people saying don't expect a big change, but the devil's in the details here, right? Yes, well, first of all, good morning. Thanks for having me. Completely agree, we're not expecting any big surprises on rate hikes. We don't think there's a lot that the Fed's gonna surprise in terms of the statement. So really the question all comes down to chair Powell's comments during the press conference. We think the question is, it's not really around PIMMIT, but really that the Fed is likely to pause as we think about interest rate hikes early next year. And I think the Jolts data that came out this morning that you mentioned really underscored the difficulty that I think the Fed faces in communicating this over the next few months. Jolts data suggested there's still plenty of economic momentum behind us, and I think that's why it's going to be so challenging for the Fed to ultimately communicate what we think will be a rate height pause at some point in early 2023. Well, recently, within the last couple months, we had Neil Kashkarig come out and say, flat out that the Fed didn't like the reaction when stocks were up on a particular Fed announcement day when they had to deliver bad news. So I'm just wondering, what are the chances that Powell comes out in tomorrow's press and just kind of reiterates his Jackson Hole thesis, which is I'm standing, I'm sticking to my guns, and we're gonna hike until something breaks here. Yeah, I think the Fed tends to, you know, in general avoid commenting on specific parts at the market, and really if you take a step back, they use the sort of broader financial conditions framework. And I think that what chair Powell is going to be trying to accomplish, you know, it's really this idea of trying to move financial conditions sideways. So we've seen, you know, we've seen a lot of financial conditions tightening so far. We think that they ultimately want to get Fed funds up to a restrictive rate and then pause likely in probably four and a half to five percent range. But I think the difficulty with that is what we've seen with markets recently. You know, there starts to be any sort of hint or commentary around this idea of pivoting or the bed slowing the pace of hikes. And you've seen markets and financial conditions start to ease. And so I think that's the challenge that the chair Powell has to deal with in communicating tomorrow. And really ultimately, I think that means that the Fed can't let financial conditions ease too much. And that's why, you know, again, we're focused on the ultimate pause probably not until next year. I want to focus on some of that labor market data. You hinted at the Joltz numbers that came out. We also have the non-farm payrolls. That's that big monthly report coming out this Friday. Unemployment expected, the unemployment rate expected to take up to 3.6 percent. And the payrolls, that number coming, I think this series estimating something like 195,000. How does this report fit in?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,70,2022-11-01 18:50:53
4575," 0.6% and the payroll is that number coming. I think the street is estimating something like 195,000. How does this report fit into your thinking and what the Fed might do for December because this is going to be in the rear-view mirror about two days now from the Fed announcement tomorrow? Yes, I think the Jolt State suggests that there's still plenty of momentum in the US labor market. And in particular, we think that the Jolt State is consistent with this idea. The company sort of exited the pandemic period under staffed. There were a variety of reasons why it was difficult to fill openings in 2021. So we think the US labor market is playing a little bit of catch up. You see that with elevate in openings. You see that with expectations. They're going to get another strong employment report for October. But to go back to the Fed, I think it's important to keep in mind that the Jolt State, the opening data, employment reports do tend to be lagging indicators. And just because we've seen really strong momentum so far, it's not a guarantee that this is going to continue forever. We do ultimately think that the tighter Fed policy is going to slow the labor market. But at least for now, Jolt State is very consistent with strong momentum. Question of, if I actually, question of when, not if, really appreciate your thoughts there, Alison Boxer, PIMCO US economist. Thanks again. Well, coming up, visaencrypto.com, teeming up for the World Cup, find out what they have in store for soccer fans. Some would call it football event up next. Ready, to say any questions right here. Welcome back. VISA and Crypto.com are partnering up ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in a two-part sponsorship, starting with an FT auction featuring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,71,2022-11-01 18:55:29
4576," VISA and crypto.com are partnering up ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in a two-part sponsorship starting with an FT auction featuring digital art inspired by iconic World Cup goals with more on all of this is Yahoo! finances David Hollerit, but David what is the skinning here? It seems kind of interesting. Yeah, so it's a two-part sponsorship in the first is an NFT auction that Visa has sort of created these. They've taken historic goals scored by former World Cup players and the goals range anywhere from 2002 goal by Jared Borgetti. It was a header. It was pretty awesome shot to 2015 goal. So what they've done is they've taken these shots and with the players and an artist turn them into abstract arts art which has then been turned into an NFT. So they're selling these at auction on crypto.com ahead of the World Cup. Then actually at Indoha Qatar during the World Cup Visa is going to have sort of this live activation they're talking about which is where they've set up a football pitch and fans can go there and they basically don't wearable sensors and they've just placed soccer and their movement can be interpreted by an algorithm that then turns it into an abstract art picture image that is then minted into an NFT. So the whole thing can be read one way is just Visa's latest experiment at introducing crypto to a global audience but it's also a bit of it flexing its own growing crypto technology prowess. But this also sort of underlines just what's been going on with crypto marketing and sports in general. And since the bear market we might even be seeing the most innovative marketing efforts happening from these players that are less exposed to crypto which is kind of an interesting development. Last year they described it as a spending gold rush where crypto firms would put so much money into sports sponsorships and that's declined about 30% this year based on data that's tracked by IEG, IEG only tracks sports sponsorships from crypto firms for the US big four leagues which is the MLB and others but the interesting thing to point is that the number of sports sponsorships by crypto firms this year 90% happened in the first half of the year before token prices were collapsed and since then we're seeing a huge difference between the number of active deals and the number of deals that actually result in a contract that's signed. So these didn't actually disclose the cost of this sponsorship but it is not something like a naming right steel that we saw last year which is estimated to be far more expensive than something like this but the interesting thing is that this is actually potentially a more interesting use of sort of taking the technology and testing it and it's kind of fascinating that you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,72,2022-11-01 18:59:33

Let's get you up to speed on the market action here because we are seeing losses across the board All three of the major averages in the red as we count down to the final hour to the final hour of trading You have the Dell off just around to 76 points giving up some of those earlier gains after that stronger than expected jobs number that we got that Jolt's number so any good news now markets not exactly like you that because that could mean we could get a more hawkish Fed We're seeing that reflected in the action today the S&B off just around a quarter of a percent in particular look at the Nasdaq 100 That's also moving to the downside off just around seven tens of a percent pulling up the action that we're seeing in the bond market You're looking at the 10-year yield off just around two basis points to 406 taking a look at the 30 year also moving to the Downside air at just around a 413 let's take a look at some of the sector action here because it certainly is a bit of a mix picture We're looking at energy and utilities holding on to the gains here followed by financials in the red though technology consumer discretionary consumer staples there Rounding out the biggest laggard in today's market taking a look at some of those individual movers I mentioned the gains that we're seeing the XLF the financial sector taking a look at some of the larger players in this FACI of JP Morgan I'm nearly 2% as well as Wells Fargo Goldman and Morgan Stanley both up just around 1% I also want to pull up some of the action that we're seeing in some of the social media news specifically the gains that we are looking at in meta you're looking at meta up Almost 3% and snap up just around 4% here the move to the upside coming after FCC commissioner reportedly calling on the government to ban tic-tox So we're seeing that reflected in those two stocks this afternoon again snap up just around a 4% Well as we await word from the Fed stocks are having a sluggish start to November a month technical analysts will remind you is usually a strong one for equities Now if you're thinking this year poses a different set of challenges including the imminent midterms you might be right But November is also known for being especially strong during election years Why? Well volatility tends to settle as volumes are higher the chopperness of the summer and back to school period is over And of course investors await the holiday season and any possibility of a good old Santa rally Well this time around we're contending with other things including unprecedented inflation and energy crisis Are will or won't they pivot discussion on the Fed and of course a battle for Congress that could mean legislative gridlock for the foreseeable future There's also of course the Fed decision tomorrow markets widely baking in a 75 basis point hike But still holding their collective breath for commentary from FedJJ Powell for any hints of a pivot or of course more walkishess We're also awaiting the October job report on Friday and another crucial CPI report as well An awful lot to sift through there for more on the broader markets We're joined by Mona Mahajan and we're Jones senior investment strategist nice to see you So let's put that all together Anything you're seeing in the markets or of course that jolt",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,73,2022-11-01 19:03:58
4578," About a market, we're joined by Mona Mahanjian and we're Jones senior investment strategist nice to see you. So let's put that all together. Anything you're seeing in the markets or of course that Joltz number that might change the thinking of the Fed as we approach that pivotal meeting. Yeah, you know what I think tomorrow's meeting, we're probably going to see that 75 basis point rate hike that would bring the Fed funds rate close to 4%. Keep in mind they've raised now 400 basis points or they will have raised after tomorrow. Nearly 400 basis points in a year which is really unprecedented and I do think it warrants perhaps a bit of a more gradual pace going forward just to see what that lag impact the real economy may be in the months ahead. Now the good news or silver lining of course for the US economy is as far we're starting really from a position of relative strength. We saw that not only in the US GDP report last week the labor report continues to be strong. We may see another meaningful report this Friday but the unemployment rate at 3.5% still near record lows, very strong wage gains, very strong increase in labor force participation is starting to creep up as well. And so broadly what we'd say is we're starting from a position of strength but the Fed has raised very quickly and probably there tends to be a 2 to 4 quarter lag impact to the real economy. We may start seeing that in the months ahead. But the good news is again if the Fed does indicate in any way that there is perhaps a more gradual pace for the December meeting that could be a positive. But the last caveat to keep in mind of course is that we've gone into tomorrow's meeting already up nearly 14% on the Dow, 8% on the S&P. The risk reward may be skewed the other way after tomorrow or at least in the near term. When we mentioned the fact that it could make sense in order for the Fed to slow down its pace of rate hikes, what about putting it on pause? Could that potentially make sense as we look out to 2023? Yeah, you know for that to happen I think we would need to see a couple things fall into place. And first and foremost of course is the inflation story. You know the Fed and global central banks are raising rates to bring down demand, to bring down the consumer, the consumption and ultimately to bring down inflation. So we would hope some of the underlying fundamentals we're seeing in terms of, you know, leading indicators like ISM prices paid, break even inflation rates, even supply chain indices are starting to show signs of easing. And we would hope over time that shows up in things like CPI inflation prints as well. So number one, we would need to see inflation cooling in a more meaningful way. And keep in mind we're starting to also see that a bit in the housing market where we're getting a little bit of, you know, some signs of cracking there as mortgage rates have doubled over nearly 7 percent now in the U.S. economy. The second thing we'd probably, you know, like to see in terms of a slower pace of fed rate hikes of course is perhaps some cracks in the labor economy or some signs that consumption has really started to slow. You know the Fed is trying to raise rates in order to cool that. I think any sign that either wage gains can moderate or perhaps consumer demand is rolling over whether we see that through earnings or economic growth. That will give the Fed a little bit of comfort that perhaps what they've done already may be enough. You know, we don't think the Fed necessarily wants to push the economy into an unnecessarily deeper, prolonged recession or downturn. And so we do think they're mindful of that, although we do think their rhetoric tomorrow will likely still be vigilant a little hawkish. And one of you mentioned that consumer and for some people it really has been a tale of two sets of consumers depending on your income bracket. What are we seeing in terms of the resilience of the consumer right now? Yeah, absolutely. You know, look, inflation has hit almost all consumers in the U.S. whether it's at the gas pumps, whether it's at the grocery stores and really in all walks of life, housing prices prior to more recently had been elevated as well. But generally, you know, when we think about consumption, you know, you look at personal consumption growth in the GDP report, for example, as really a gauge of consumer strength, that has shown some resilience. It was 2 percent last quarter. It fell to 1.4 percent this past quarter ending September 30th. Still, you know, moderating trends, but still, you know, relatively resilient. But interestingly, when you look under the surface there, what's driving that growth is a demand for services. And all the leisure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,74,2022-11-01 19:08:17
4579," you know, moderating trends, but still, you know, relatively resilient. But interestingly, when you look under the surface there, what's driving that growth is a demand for services. So all the leisure, hospitality, traveling we've been doing over the summer months has shown up as services demand. When you look at goods demand, that's where we're really seeing negative growth actually over the last quarter. So there's really been this shift in consumption and consumer pattern, consumer behavior away from goods, you know, all the Amazon packages we were buying towards services. So it'll be interesting to see in the months ahead, especially if that trend continues to hold or we do get a softening in the services and ultimately a softening in the consumer. Mona, I wish those Amazon boxes would stop showing up in my house. It's still every day. We get them too. I know you're watching the yields in particular, the spread between the 10 year and the three months, which you're telling you and ought to be telling the Fed what. Yeah, you know, it's interesting. The 10 year, two year curve had inverted months ago and actually since mid-July it's been negative. And that was our first kind of yellow to red flag that perhaps a slowdown is coming and keep in mind an inverted yield curve tends to mean that a recessionary period or downturn is forthcoming, but there's a lag again between six and 18 months. The one that we tend to pay more attention to and I think the Fed does as well is the 10 year, three month curve. The three month yield tends to track more closely the Fed funds rate and then the 10 year tends to tell you what the future of the economy and really inflationary pressures may be. And the three month has now exceeded the 10 year. And so we have an inverted curve there as well. And that's a signal as well that perhaps the Fed needs to go at a slower pace because what credit markets or parts of credit markets are telling them is that a slowdown is forthcoming. And so something to keep in mind, it's another one of those yellow flags that we've added to our list including leading indicators including a little bit of pressure on ISM including the housing market cooling that tell us that the economy is on track to slow below trend growth at least. And so the Fed is watching all these metrics closely as well and whether or not they hinted or not tomorrow will be interesting but certainly having a 50 basis point rate hike in December still an outsized rate hike is likely on the table for them at this point. And that's just we'll certainly be hanging on the words of J. Powell tomorrow. Thank you, Mono Maharjian for joining us this afternoon. All right, well details trickling out on Elon Musk's latest plans for Twitter. Just moments ago he tweeted as part of a thread, power to the people, blue for $8 a month. Musk adding that blue users will get priority and replies, mentions, search, ability to post long video and audio and half as many advertisements. Musk also including that if a paid blue account engages in spam or a scam that account will be suspended. It seems like obviously every day something seems to be trickling out. We know there was a lot of back and forth between him and author Stephen King about the price and clearly settling on $8 here. Is that reasonable? Is that something that you guys would be willing to pay, Sean? I would not be willing to pay. I don't know how much I would not be willing to pay much. I know that a lot of people out there were saying that they would pay a lot more than $8 a month. I think that that is still very expensive. It adds up very quickly, but my takeaway though is just from Elon Musk taking over at Twitter and the news flow and the changes that we have seen in just the past couple of days. He certainly is not wasting any time laying out his vision. He's making some changes. He's making known what he wants to do. We know subscription growth Dave has been something that has been very important to him. He's talked about when it comes to the future of Twitter. So not necessarily a big surprise. $8 though. A little steep for me. A little steep for me. I'm out on that. No thank you. Although again, we've pointed this out before. A lot of people would pay 20, 30, 40, 50 and Steve Yang yesterday said he'd pay $100 a month of founder and investor. So look, I think that is a lot of money. But if you can, the poll that they put out, their investor Jason Calicanas, 83% said they would pay zero for Twitter, blue or verification. But 10% of the 222 million people that voted said they would pay $5 a month and additional 2% said they'd pay $10 a month. So I'm just ballpark figures here, Richelle. There's a potential for...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,75,2022-11-01 19:12:38
4580," voted said they would pay five bucks a month and additional two percent said they'd pay ten bucks a month. So I'm just ballpark figures here, Richelle. There is a potential for north of a hundred million bucks a month in revenue if that poll is at all correct. So hey, you got to give Elon credit for figuring some way to bring in some revenue. Again, I think the vast majority would be in line with that poll saying no thanks. I won't pay a dime. But we didn't get your take. I think you'd pay nothing, right? Well, you already know I've paid nothing. I will say just as a quick caveat though, they did say it would be cheaper depending on where in the world you are. So if you're in a country where you don't earn as much, they would say that they would actually adjust that pricing even lower as well. A lot's to discuss and we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live, of course. Coming up, we dive into some of those issues that will sway investor sentiment most when the Fed releases its latest policy decision. And of course, we're also looking at New York City's pay transparency law now in effect. See how this changes the game for job seekers and employers alike. And earnings from Airbnb and advanced micro devices are on tap after the bell. We'll bring you the numbers as soon as they break. Don't come anywhere. We'll be right back. Two major airlines facing labor issues. United pilots rejecting a contract deal that would have given them a 15% raise over the next year and a half. But the union says the deal fell short of what the pilots deserve. The airline pilots association saying in a statement that roughly 94% of them voted against the agreement. Meanwhile, Delta pilots voting to authorize a strike if contract negotiations between the airline and its union do not yield an agreement. Now the union represents almost 15,000 of the Atlanta-based carriers pilots and says nearly all of them cast their ballots in favor of the strike. Earlier said then done however, as the under-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,76,2022-11-01 19:17:07

Earlier said then, done, however, as the under-US law pilots cannot walk off the job without permission from the National Mediation Board. So the story will continue to watch their delta shares under pressure today. All right, big businesses are reporting higher profits as Americans struggle under the weight of inflation. And back in June, Americans were showing out an average of $5 a gallon for gas. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobile's profit for Q3 are triple what they made last year. And the most they've made ever, President Biden, voicing his concern about oil profits at the White House yesterday. Oil companies, record profits today are not because they're doing something new or innovative. Their profits are a windfall of war. The windfall from the brutal conflict that's ravaging Ukraine and hurting tens of millions of people around the globe. It's time for these companies to stop more profiteering. Meet their responsibilities to this country. Give the American people a break and still do very well. Oil is not the only industry turning a profit on higher costs. Take a look at PepsiCo reporting prices for drinks and chips up at 17 percent year over year. It's saying its profits grew around 20 percent in the third quarter. Rick Newman is here to take a look at what this could mean, I guess, for the Biden administration targeting more industries given the fact that big oil is far from the only sector here reporting record profits. What do you think? Here's my favorite comparison. So I looked up Apple's profits. So Exxon Mobile, yes, getting windfall profits from high oil prices. It's probably going to earn around $50 billion in profits this year. It's full year and probably have a profit margin of about 12 percent. Now what do you think Apple's profits are going to be this year? I won't put you guys in the spot. Probably double that, probably $100 billion. And what's its profit margin going to be? Probably 25 percent, double Exxon Mobile. Who is calling for a windfall tax on Apple? Absolutely nobody. And who's calling for a windfall tax on Exxon? Only a few people right now. It's President Biden, a few liberal Democrats. And the whole thing is going to die on November 9th once the midterm elections are over. But he did address that in this speech. He did say it's not because of any innovation or technical-advancement. So he did address the difference between an Apple or an alphabet and a big oil company. The question is, is this actually a policy? Has he ever laid out how this would work? Tear point. There's no chance this gets through. It's probably Republican Senate, maybe, and House. But how would the policy even work? It's a fair question. There are two bills in Congress that would impose a windfall tax on oil companies. And you define a windfall tax on profits above some level that's like an aggregate of the averages of the last five years or something like that. It could be based on revenue. Revenue. She could be based on revenue to the company. Or it could be simply based on the price of the underlying commodity in global markets, which is oil. So you could do it in one of two different ways. There are many other ways you could do it. You have to think very hard about the unintended consequences because if you raise the cost of producing oil or the raised the cost to oil producers in the wrong way, you're going to just push up oil and gasoline prices. And there's some concern that if you did it wrong, that is exactly what would happen. So I would like to point out though that- And her production levels are all likely to be the same. And the thing Biden really wants is more production. It's not that he per se wants to punish the companies for making too much money. He wants more production so that we have more supply and the price comes down. And that's probably going to happen by- We're probably going to get to new record levels of U.S. oil production by next year. But just a- We're 12 million. You're 12 million. You're 12 million. You're 12 million. We're probably going to hit 13 by next year. But just to be clear, when Democrats controlled both House of Congress earlier this year and gas prices hit $5 a gallon, they're under $4 now, this did not get any money. Any serious play, there was talk about a windfall oil tax. So Congress would have to pass a law. They talked about it. It was never packaged into any serious legislative package. And I don't think even think Democrats could pass it. They would have enough votes among Democrats to pass it. So if you want to talk about, could it work?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,77,2022-11-01 19:21:20
4582," and I think, I don't think even think Democrats could pass it, they would have enough votes among Democrats to pass it. So if you wanna talk about could it work in theory, yes it could work in theory, is it politically plausible? Absolutely not. And by the way, when you started the show talking about oil evaluations and exLA evaluations, up today, up during the last five days, which means the market sees zero threat to oil industry profits from this idea. Yeah, let's go to finance. So Rick, does it basically just come down to perception? Obviously, when you think about consumer spending, discretionary, that brings your iPhone into question versus these three foot high numbers you see with gas prices. Is it really in terms of sort of demonizing so for these companies, whereas they don't do it for say food companies or a company like Apple? Probably, but think about another thing Biden is doing here. I mean, he's clearly trying, and what I think is a fairly desperate way to play to the left wing, excuse me, the Democratic Party, which is the progressives who hate the oil companies and would be quite happy to put them out of business. And we got to get off of oil and gasoline and natural gas tomorrow, and it doesn't matter how much we have to pay in the interim until we have all the renewables. I don't get the logic of this, a one week before the elections, because basically it's, I guess the thinking is, maybe there are these progressive voters who aren't going to vote, but if Biden comes out and trashes the oil companies, they're going to get all fired up and say, oh, if a windfall tax for oil companies is on the ballot, then I'm definitely going to vote. Look, if people aren't fired up by Roe v. with the Supreme Court over turning Roe v. Wade over the summer, I mean, is this really going to increase turnout? Is it going to change anybody's mind in the last week of the election? I don't think so. And there are already a lot of independence in particular, and some almost law Republicans who blame Biden for hiring gas prices is not entirely his fault, but he's already got a lot of independence who think it is, and that's bad news. We often talk political footballs, this is a political hail Mary. That's all it is by President Biden. Senior columnist Rick Newman, good to see you, sir. Thank you. All right, coming up another rate hike on the docket, and you could argue, no one knows the anatomy of the Fed better than the Wall Street Journal's John Hill Sonsbath. Stephen Roche once said, he's, quote, the real chair will get his take on the FOMC smallest Meeting, and his new book about Janet Yell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,78,2022-11-01 19:26:11
4583," The FOMC's two-day meeting underway in a 75-point basis hike, all but certain for tomorrow. Attention already turning to the Feds next meeting on December 14th, and whether or not inflation is decelerated enough to justify a smaller move, even just a quarter point. Our next guest has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his work covering the FED and is out with a new book on the former Fed Chair and current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Nice to have John Hilsenrath, Jim, apparently. I think you're right for the Wall Street Journal in studio with us today. Good to see you, man. So look on Twitter. No better barometer. So let's talk about tomorrow's meeting, all but certain as we mentioned there, 75-point hike. What's your biggest question about what we'll hear from Jerome Powell? Well, you know, I think so he's kind of opened the door to slowing down the pace of rate increases, and the question is does he open the door a little bit? How was he open the door? Well, he said if we see clear and convincing evidence that inflation is slowing, then we'll consider it. So the question is whether in the meeting itself they've started to talk about that. Frankly, I actually think the really important moment isn't tomorrow. It's not the Fed meeting. It's next Thursday, because next Thursday is when the CPI inflation numbers come out, and he said they want to see clear and convincing evidence. So that's when you look for the clear and convincing evidence. Do you think they have seen it? No. Okay. No. I think that they've been disappointed. I think there was starting to see some signs of it this summer, and the last couple of readings in these CPI reports were very disappointing. So, John, what about some of these issues or concerns that people have that the Fed isn't taking enough time for things to digest and would be reflected in the real economy? I think that's a totally fair and legitimate question, and it's surprising to me that you don't hear more of that coming out of the Federal Open Market Committee itself. There's a lot of very independent, minded Federal Reserve Bank presidents who you would think some of them would say at this point, all right, we've done a lot. Let's slow things down and see how it's doing. But Jerome Powell has the Fed really moving in the direction that he wants, and that's to move very aggressively. I think one of the real concerns is that there's a lot of momentum that you get behind Fed decisions. When they do three quarters of a percentage point, it's hard to get off that because if they slow down, then everyone says, oh, they're going to stop. And if they stop, everyone says, oh, they're going to cut rates. The market is always two steps ahead of them. So, the Fed is kind of stuck in this path of continuing to do what they're doing or else, because they're afraid that the market's going to get ahead of them. And, John, just taking a step back, just your assessment of the economy right now, because when you take a look at the latest GDP report, when you take a look at the jobs out of that we got out this morning job openings, every single thing or most data points, so point to the fact that it is a very resilient economy. Yet there is this fear out there that we are going to slip into our recession. Where do you stand on that debate? Well, we got a good GDP report a week or so ago, 2.6% in the third quarter, and it contracted in the first half of the year. The worry is that, like, that's the best we're going to get this year. We're seeing a big slowdown in housing. We're seeing consumer spending slowdown. The rest of the world is looking very weak. So, I think there, I mean, and the economists that we survey every quarter are saying, recession in 2023. So, I think that's a real risk, and I think the Fed has kind of potentially created a momentum behind all these rate increases that they're having a hard time scaling back, which is why they're going to be praying on Wednesday night, next Wednesday, not this Wednesday, that those inflation numbers start to soften, because they probably would like to slow this thing down at this point, but they lose credibility if they do it before the inflation numbers tail off a little bit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,79,2022-11-01 19:30:00
4584," Oh, this thing down at this point. But the loose credibility, if they do it, before the inflation numbers tell off a little bit. So, John, when you think of the conversations behind this scene, when you do have these periods, and before the Fed makes an announcement like this, especially as you studied how Janet Yellen has moved in the family dynamic that came into the policy making there, give us some insight into the conversations that might be happening right now. Well, I mean, I think the most important thing you have to think about when you're watching the Fed and the market is always watching the Fed is, it's a very glacial moving institution. Unless there's an actual crisis in their face when they can do things overnight, they tend to take months and months and months to move the ship in a new direction, which is why they were behind the curve on raising rates to begin with, because it took them too long to say, oh, wow, we're out over our skis. We kept rates too low for too long. And they might be running into the same problem now on the back end of this, that they're gonna want to see clearer and convincing evidence that's J. Powell's terms before they slow the pace of rate increases. Well, by the time they've slowed it down and stopped it, we might already be in a recession. So what I would say about the debate is it's very slow moving. And I always try to kind of look at just kind of incremental changes. There's somebody new in there saying, well, what about this or what about that? And so, I mean, I haven't done these press conferences in a while, if I were doing it, I would want to know, well, how did the debate change? Not what did you do today, but what did you start talking about that we might see in the next meeting or two in December or January? So it's bottom line. Goldman has 75, 50, 25 and 25 again in March. Do you agree with that consensus? Oh, you know what, I don't, I don't do that. You don't do that. That's the answer. I mean, I think, I kind of rather talk about kind of risks and stuff like that. And I think there's a risk that they're going too far, and that they've moved too fast too far. And the risk, I think, is to the financial system. So, I mean, the economy has been growing very fast. It needs to slow down, and I understand all that. But when the Fed raises rates aggressively, even when it raises rates slowly, stuff tends to break in financial markets. And so, what I wonder about is, what's breaking out there right now that we might be learning about in one, three, six months. And so, you know, we might find out about it. And, you know, we have to see inflation slow down. That's the bottom, that's been the bottom line all year. And, and it just hasn't happened, which is disappointing. I think for every American right now. It is disappointing. It's certainly caught Treasury Secretary Jen Yellen off guard. I think a bit just in terms of how sticky this inflation has been. I know you had a number of conversations. We have a new book here, OnSet. Congratulations. I think the whole thing that up. Of course, of course. I've got your bottle of champagne on your mic. I've got your bottle of champagne on your mic. Very old crack and open for it. But I guess you're take away from the biggest lessons that maybe she has learned, and are more than two decades in Washington, and then also point you to the fact that there have been some rumors that she could be stepping as high as Treasury Secretary following the midterms or thoughts on that. And I guess who could potentially be the next Treasury Secretary? Right. So, let me take the last question first. So, I asked her about this. She's just a week and a half, two weeks ago. And she said to me very emphatically, she does not intend to leave the job. And that she likes doing it. She thinks it's important. She could see herself staying there for four years. Given the fact that these rumors have been going around, I doubt she would have said that unless A, she had really thought it through. And B, unless, you know, she knew she was talking on the Wall Street Journal. I don't think she would have said it unless she had told the White House she was going to say it. So, when she says she plans to stick around after the midterms, I believe her. You know, right now there's a lot of rumors out there. But you never know where they're coming from. They just kind of float around in Washington and sometimes, you know, and they get repeated. When the person who the rumors are about says, I don't intend to leave very publicly. I don't know. I mean, maybe I'll be caught off on this, but, you know, I doubt she would have said it unless she believed it and she had told the White House she was going to say it. And then the biggest lessons from the 20 years. So, you know, that's a big, long answer. I'll say two things. First of all, you know, there's a lot of idealized.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,80,2022-11-01 19:34:26
4585," she was going to say. And then the biggest lessons from the 20 years. So that's a big, long answer. I'll say two things. First of all, there's a lot of ideological debate in Washington and over the airwaves and conservative policies, liberal policies, spend too much, tax too little. What I found is that in watching her careers, that the big mistakes that have been made over the years, they haven't been ideological. It's been human error. It's been misjudging where you are right now. So this inflation is a great example of it. So the federal government dumped money into the economy during COVID. In part, because we had been through a decade of very low inflation, then they thought they could. And they were learning the lesson of the last expansion and applying it to this one. And they just thought the last war, and they misread the situation and now we have inflation. I would call it human error more than ideological error. And it boggles my mind because we debate ideological issues all the time, but it's really like, are you making the right, and this is what she said to me. You've got to look at the facts on the ground right now and read the environment. The other thing I'd say about Janet Yellen that kind of drew me to the story is, this is a woman in a very male dominated field. A field that hasn't been very friendly, frankly, to women over the years. She broke every single glass ceiling in that field. And I think you can learn some lessons about the workplace, balancing, working family from her story. One of the great parts of the story that I focus on in the book, it's actually a love story, Yellen and her husband. The partnership that the two of them formed, him taking on full respect, this guy won a Nobel Prize in Economics. He took on full responsibilities at home. And she took on equal responsibilities in the workplace. And the two of them together became the most powerful influential couple in the economics industry. By creating a partnership, equal partnership on both sides. It's a really interesting story. Yeah, certainly a remarkable story. And like you said here in the title, Yellen, the trailblazing economist who navigated an era of upheaval. John Hilton, right? Great to have you on set. Thanks so much for joining us. You're doing great. That was fun. Thanks. All right, coming up next, you don't want to miss the Yahoo Finance coverage of the Fed decision, a 2 PM Eastern. That's a 75 basis point hike. It looks like a lot. But Jay Powell's a news conference. We'll be watched with laser focus for any hints on the path ahead. You won't want to miss that.

4586," It's time for Triple Play with three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. It's got a Sinner World, Walmart and Carvana on tap. Now Sinner World is my pick, Sinner World Group. The stock is the world's second largest movie theater chain operator and it's been skyrocketing. It was more than 200% around noon, currently down just below that about 195% up for the day. After announcing Monday, it reached a chapter 11 bankruptcy settlement with landlords and lenders. This pays the way for the company to borrow an additional 150 million and make a $1 billion debt repayment. To reach the steel, Sinner World agreed to pay at least $20 million in rent that will accrue after September 30th, also export a potential sale of the business and allow input from creditors on its business plan going forward. Now, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, Corvio agreement, a quote, pretty amazing result, given more than a dozen objections to that loan at the start of the case. Short sellers having a field day betting against the stock in meme stock-like fashion. Even with today's rally, the stock is down more than 70% year to date as it failed to recover from COVID-related lockdowns and, of course, debt tied to its $3.6 billion purchase of regal back in 2018. Certainly, a step in the right direction, but it will be interesting to see how this all plays out for Sinner World. All right, my pick today is Walmart, the retail giant, cutting the cost of its Walmart Plus membership in half. For just two days, it's going to cost new sign-ups, just 49 bucks, with members getting early access to Black Friday deals that start next week. And as part of the deal and as part of any deal with Walmart Plus, members will get access to Paramount Plus and also six months of a Spotify premium for free. If you're thinking about it, you've got to act fast though, because this offer is only good today through Thursday. So you could get a deal, 49 bucks, about half off day if then what you would typically do. Just want to point out one of the greatest shows on TV. Yellowstone coming up in two weeks on Paramount Plus. That could help. That could help. So it makes that decision a little bit easier for you. All right, my play is car, news car retailer, Carvana, CVNA, a trending ticker on Yahoo Finance right now. Shear surging at a JP Morgan upgrade from neutral, from underweight. The note does urge caution, however, saying it's not quite out of the woods yet, but that the case risk seems to be better understood by Carvana. This stock is down more than 90% this year, shutting about half its market cap just since that brutal Q2 earnings report. The company said rising rates, inflationary pressure, and waning consumer confidence hurt sales. JP Morgan analysts reject, goop to set a $20 price target on the stock that implies a nearly 70% upside those shares up more than 12% on the day. Michelle? I mean, when you think about how high used and new car prices are, it's no surprise that people are holding onto their vehicles longer, making it tough for some of these used car resellers like Carvana for sure. Not a few years, but a little bit of upside there. Coming up, after a strong start to the year, institutional investors appear to be easing off on commercial real estate, but a switch of direction from the Fed could change all that. We speak with Kimco on results and the industry. That's*)",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,82,2022-11-01 19:43:03
4587,"kten Hi, our rates don't tend to mean good things for reets or real estate investment trust overalls and now their average range of It's great to see you again. So it doesn't look like when we talk about the fact that the real estate market is slowing down a possible recession looming. Obviously, you would think, well, I mean, pretty concerning time for your business. Kimco, though, seems to be in a pretty great position. What's your assessment just of where you stand and what we could likely see over the coming months? That's great to see you, too. Thanks for having me. You know, Kimco is in the sweet spot of retail right now. Grocery Anchored Shopping Centers, which is what we primarily own, continues to be in the retail revival. We're seeing it with demand across all the different square footages that we have in our shopping centers. And a lot of it has to do with some major takeaways that we were net beneficiaries of the pandemic. So the big key is really understanding that brick and mortar versus e-commerce. That debate is really settled. It really is a combination of the two that is the sweet spot that makes retailers more profitable and connect deeper with their consumer. And that's what's really driving the robust demand across our shopping centers is when you think about the big powerhouses of e-commerce. They're actually all opening physical stores. And they're using those stores not only to sell merchandise out of it, but using it as last mile distribution fulfillment. And that's the game changer. That's really what's driving our robust results in allowing us to beat and raise multiple times this year. Often times we've heard about the death of brick and mortar conner and yet the numbers are astounding right now. Retail vacancies in the second quarter. And we're going to be able to get a lot of money from the $1.1% the lowest in 15 years, more stores opened than closed in 21 for the first time since 1995. What is pushing people back to stores? And in some cases away from e-commerce. Well, I think a lot of it has to do with human nature. I think when something is taken away from you, all of a sudden you start to realize how much you really need that or you want it. And I think that's what happened. And services. So a lot of people during the pandemic really spent all of their dollars on goods. And now you're seeing it really shift back towards the service part of the economy. And with the the Gross Ranked Shopping Center, that only comes down to the hair salons, the nail salons, a lot of the medical, the health and wellness uses that are doing quite well today. So you're seeing it across the spectrum of what really works today in retail. And the fascinating part is the consumer still is engaging in the shopping center on a higher rate than they were even last year. And that's good news for shoppers and that's good news for retailers. And obviously where sales go, we can increase rents then. Connor, when you take a look at some of the, I guess, some of your larger 10-inch, you have all the big names from TJX to Home Depot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,83,2022-11-01 19:47:30
4588," So obviously where sales go, we can increase rents then. Connor, when you take a look at some of the, I guess, some of your larger tenants, you have all the big names from T.J. X to Home Depot to Whole Foods as your anchor tenants. They make up about 54% of your space there, but you also have large exposure to small shop tenants, maybe a 46% of your portfolio with the risk of recession fears that maybe some of the smaller shops won't be able to pay their rent. Are you starting to see any evidence of this? We're looking for it, but we haven't seen any cracks yet. And one of the things to keep in mind with the small shops, which sometimes makes you think about maybe the local Pizzeria, our small shops are large national chains. So JP Morgan Chase is actually the largest small shop tenant that we have in the portfolio. And you go across the top 50 small shops and all of them are national and typically a high credit rated company. So we've seen it just across the board in terms of demand right now, really driving our results. And it's a nice part to be where I can let the results speak for themselves because a lot of people had made up their mind on physical brick and water retail. And you could talk until you're blue in the face and sometimes it's better just let the results speak for themselves. Just curious what you make of these new numbers out from alignable that show 37% of small businesses unable to pay their rent for the month of October. The number we just showed 50% in Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey right there on its heels, Pennsylvania also in the top five, these are states where you have properties. Yeah, that's an interesting stat. I mean, think about the Kimco consumer and the Kimco shopping center. We're typically the first ring suburb in the major metropolitan areas across the country. And that's where the affluent shopper continues to engage in the shopping center. I'm thinking that that stat may include maybe some of the lower demographic areas. And when you think about the inflationary pressures that people are really dealing with today, that's where we've seen. I think the lower demographic really feel the brunt of the issues that are that are facing the economy today is the inflationary impact is really having a dramatic effect on that lower demographic profile. Fortunately, Kimco is positioned really in the higher affluent areas. The first ring demograph, the first ring suburb is where again, you saw the suburbanization effect take hold in the pandemic. So again, we were in a beneficiary from that migration pattern. And Connor Flynn always great to have you CEO of Kimco Realty. We look forward to having you back again soon. Thanks so much for joining us. Coming up, good faith employment HR departments in New York City are about to get a lot busier as fresh legislation will allow jobs, and the emergency emergency salary ranges. We look at the chances of a wider uptake in the cultural impact next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,84,2022-11-01 19:51:50
4589," Position the Job seekers and the big app will may have an easier time landing that dream job now, or at least a fatter paycheck. Starting today, employers advertising for jobs in this city must include a salary range in the description, including a specific minimum and maximum dollar amount. Our next guest, salary.com's vice president of consulting, David Turetsky joins us now with more. So a lot of people wondering who's getting the good end of this when you have this transparency on the table. Hey, Rachelle. So I think what happens is you're creating the right environment so that people can understand what it is they're being asked to do and how much are they going to get paid for it. Too often we have people who go into interviews not really understanding what the pay is going to be for that role until they get very deep into the interview process and that causes a lot of distrust. David, when you take a look at, I guess get some critics out there saying yes, this is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done salary ranges are going to be in good faith. There's no penalty for paying someone outside of the range posted. What do you say to that? I'd say that no law ever goes far enough, but what we're trying to do is set up an environment where there's better information for both the job seeker as well as the employer. Having that understanding and that appropriate understanding about what it is that this job is going to be paying gives them a good, gives the candidate a really good understanding about whether or not this is the right job for them and as well it also kind of self-selects out some people who might be just kind of wasting time tire kicking because they won't be interested in that job if it's not paying enough. Now let's talk pros and cons here because you know one of the prongs is this is expected to help shrink gender and racial pay disparities, but then a lot of people might be looking at some of these perhaps seeing these salary ranges saying look I don't have any room to grow, I'm not even going to bother applying there. What do you see as the main pros and cons when you look at this sort of legislation? Well, I think the pro is always giving more information is better than less information. And when you're giving that person the ability to see what the range is of pay, they can make that decision for themselves. Do I stay where I am and leave the job I have and you know with the grass always being greener? If I understand that the pay is what it is at this company, will I actually grow? That's a different story that gets into my career development and the career frameworks that are available. So it takes that employee, that potential employee to be asking what's the next steps here? Where can my career grow? So they have to be better informed about being able to ask the right question, what's the promotion potential? If I think my pay is going to be close to that maximum, I really need to be asking what's the next step for me? And of course, the con is that we may not be getting the right people for that job because they may self-select out because it's not paying enough. But to be honest, in this competitive market for skills, I really doubt people are going to be turning away just because the pay range may not meet exactly what their hopes and dreams are. Remember, this is only about base pay. The ranges are posted about base pay. We're not dealing with benefits. We're not dealing with bonuses or stock. This is just base pay ranges. It's a important distinction there. David, when you take a look, I guess at this movement that's happening now when it comes to pay transparency. So this law taking effect in New York City this week, California has a pay transparency law taking effect in January. Do you see this momentum continuing and maybe getting more big cities on board with pay transparency? Absolutely. This is inescapable now. I mean, we have the internet. So you can find out what ranges of pay are on the internet anyways. And so once the big markets of New York City and California start to go towards transparency, there's really no turning back. It really will be a now cascading effect of other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,85,2022-11-01 19:56:01
4590," and California start to go towards transparency. There's really no turning back. It really will be a now cascading effect of other markets now taking this on. Colorado was one of the first ones to bring this. And what we've seen now is is that when you see jobs posted, a lot of jobs are now coming with pay ranges, even though they're not really required. So it's a step in the right direction. It certainly is. I think it's interesting. All of the violators could ultimately be find up to $250,000 for violating. That's certainly a lot on the table here. A big thank you for joining us. Salary dot com vice president of consulting, David Turetski. Thank you for having us. All right. Well, let's take a look what's happening. We're counting down to the closing ball on Wall Street. Stick with us on Young Finance Live to see how the markets settle. All right. Just a couple of minutes away from the closing bell. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Jared Blyckery to break down the market action. Hello, sir. What are we seeing? Well, we got a down day in the major. As a Russell 2000 up about 18 basis points. So Toronto exchange up about half a percent there. And we want to check inside the US markets. S&P 500 sector action energy is the biggest gainer today. That is up 1% and more than double the second biggest one, which is utilities followed by financials, materials, and health care, all of those in the green consumer discretionary. Still in last place here, followed by tech and communication services. Those three bottom are rounding out the sectors. And also those represent those big names right here. Amazon down 5% alphabet down. 4% although meta formally Omega cap stock doesn't look like a right now based on that rectangle size. That is up 2%.

That is up over 5% followed by gambling ETF bets, emerging markets, Korean stocks, meme stocks, biotech, chip stocks and solar energy. All of those outperforming here cannabis stocks taking a hit to the downside down about three and a half. I'm going to take a look at some bank stocks here. The Wells Fargo up 2% HSBC. And there you have it. Your first closing bell of November to kick us off a jittery day as we saw all three major indices ended off their session lows. But as we see the Dalbe losing about a quarter of a percent. They're down 82 points. The S&P 500 down 0.4% and the NASDAQ down almost almost 1% of our 0.9% than using 97 points on the day. And as we mentioned there, the strongest performance sector wise energy and utilities. Well, let's take a closer look now at the broader markets. Let's bring it our market panel. We have Lorraine Gilbert, wealth wise financial CEO and Tim Chubb, chief investment officer at Gerard, a university wealth division. Thank you to you both. So Tim, as we obviously are seeing the markets sort of draw this collective breath ahead of some of these finer words that we're going to get from Jay Pal at the moment. How should people be reacting? How should they be positioning themselves this week? Yeah. Thanks for having me. It's difficult to say here in the short term. It obviously we saw a pretty sharp rally and the S&P over the course of October. I think it was up close to 8%. And you ultimately seeing some of the data today really suggests at least us that early hasn't been the signs that we need to see, you know, as far as a labor market breaking, ultimately what the Fed is looking for, which obviously drives into the inflation data. And so I know everyone's looking for a pivot or a pause. I likely, you know, we think that we'll likely see rate increases that continue into early next year and ultimately slowing down from this 75 basis point rate, rate hike. But we're finally getting to a point where there's some value in the markets, both in fixed income inequities. And so that leads us a bit off the mystic, you know, given the margin of safety that we now have in some of these great compound and type companies. Lauren, what do you think? I guess do you agree? And is there anything to say no to you that maybe the Fed is going to pause next year after the next two rate hikes? Yeah, I think that we know eventually the Fed is going to pause. And the question is when? So not right now, certainly we're expecting 75 basis points tomorrow, followed by most likely another 50 basis points and then maybe another 25. So we're certainly not done yet, but we have probably hit the peak as far as accelerating interest rate hikes. And the other thing I would say is that we're now entering as far as the markets, the best six months of the year. So over the next six months tends to be some of the best months in the market. So just as investors have been growing weary, it's not time to stop investing. Yeah, and Tim, do you think a pause is coming and let's call it February or March? And what are the markets looking to hear from Powell tomorrow? I think the big things that ultimately the Fed has been pretty clear on is you need to see a selling inflation data, which you know, it's definitely started to pick up here on, you know, some of these more cyclical prices on the good side of things. But obviously a lot of the retailers have reported it's from pretty high inventory levels and we're already seeing demands soften at the same time. The supply chains are getting better. So, you know, I think inflation is moving in the right direction, but certainly not as fast as we would all like. And I think the Fed is likely looking at inflation, GDP, the labor market as being stubbornly strong. And ultimately, I think the Fed needs to outstubber with further monetary tightening. And so, you know, we feel very similarly as far as the path of Fed hikes, and it will likely be, you know, first quarter next year that we would potentially see, you know, that pause and letting the terminal rate, you know, do its damage on the economy. And maybe we start to see some of those other elements break as the Fed's been looking forward to so the pace of inflation. And then we know that the Fed obviously has its eye outside of the US as well. What we're seeing with China zero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,87,2022-11-01 20:04:36
4592," break as the feds been looking for it so the pace of inflation. And, Larry, we know that the Fed obviously has its eye outside of the U.S. as well, what we're seeing with China's zero-COVID policy and that impact on its economy. And, of course, what we're seeing with Russia's impact on Europe and the energy crisis there. How much is that also weighing on the Fed's decision making right now? Well, I don't know that the Federal Reserve is going to be focused on that. They're going to be looking at, you know, the numbers here and what's going on. The Joltz number today was a surprise on how many of those job openings there are. And I think that we're going to hear from the Fed tomorrow that that continues to be a thorn in their side as far as not being able to slow down or stop those rate hikes quite yet. As far as the risks, though, in the market, certainly the geopolitical risks are out there to the markets. And that is what you mentioned, both what's going on in China and just the continued slowdown there as well as what's going on in Russia and the impact on Europe. To mature assessment of earnings season so far, we're awaiting earnings from AMD and Airbnb out after the bell. We're coming off what was a very busy week for big tech. A lot of those results, disappointing the street in terms of expectations. Why has been your takeaway from the numbers that we have seen up until this point? Yeah, I think, you know, very much similarly to the second quarter, it was better than expected thus far, although the companies that we've seen, you know, beat both on top and bottom, we've seen, you know, less of an outsized response, you know, basically, you know, investors, you know, favoring those companies, you know, after the report. We haven't seen 2023 guidance come down enough yet. And we're starting to see that start the trickle through as we've seen estimates come down for this quarter in the next quarter. And ultimately that's going to be a major headwind for stocks, especially on the cyclical side of things where we feel a lot more confident that we haven't seen earnings revisions necessarily flow through properly, especially with what the Fed intentions are, you know, as we close out the year. But on the other hand, you know, we definitely have seen companies get rewarded for really flexing that operating leverage. And so, you know, despite some of the weak tech earnings that we've seen thus far, I think a lot of that stew the cyclicality of advertising that we're experiencing at the moment. But we have seen, you know, a bit of a reward for businesses that have been able to, you know, see their free cash flow margins come in a bit better than expect it. And those companies that have had were exact guidance on just what levers they intend on pulling from a capital allocation strategy in a difficult economic environment. Lorraine, we'll be at the polls a week from today midterm elections. This is typically a very strong six month cycle in a midterm election year. What type of catalyst do you expect the midterms to be? And do you think this will be the exception to that rule where it is typically a very strong market for equities? Yeah, we typically do see that and we expect that this year as well. So from the November elections through the end of the year on average, there tends to be an 8% swing upward and one year out from those elections tends to be on average 15%. But then again, if you look at similar years to what we've been experiencing, those numbers in the past have even been higher. So that's what I say for investors not to grow too weary and to stick with it because we do think that there are opportunities on the upside. And one other thing I'll add about earning season is that we are technically really in an earnings recession right now. If you take out energy and you really look at what's happening and what we're seeing happen in these earnings calls is as we're hearing negative guidance going forward, those companies are definitely being hit. So that's what we're seeing during earning season. All right, we'll have to leave it there. Lorraine Gilbert, Tim Chubb. Thank you both for being here. Much appreciated. Be sure to tune into Yahoo! Finance's live coverage tomorrow of the Fed decision. 2 PM Eastern time will break down what the central bank's policy decision means for taming inflation and how to roll in Powell's comments will impact Wall Street.

After hours will take a closer look at its earnings report right after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,88,2022-11-01 20:08:55
4593,"нос I have an earnings alert. You can see the shares of Airbnb moving down about 8% and after hours trading after reporting earnings deared blickery here with numbers. Presumably, the investors don't like what, sir? The guidance, guidance a little bit light will get to that in a second and let's go over the numbers. So for the third quarter revenue coming in ahead of Wall Street estimates, 2.88 billion. That's up 29% year over year that beats the estimate of 2.83 billion. Now gross bookings, that value comes in at 15.6 billion dollars. That is higher than the estimate of 15.25 billion. Up 31% year over year, adjusted EBITDA 1.46 billion versus estimates of 1.39 billion and then EPS coming in at $1.79 on a fully diluted basis versus the estimate of $1.53. So nice beat there also beating it last year's number of $1.22. Nights and experience booked 99.7 million versus estimates of 99.9 million. So slight miss there and that's also going to factor into a statement that I'm going to read in a second. Gross booking value per Nights and experience is booked 156.44. $156.44. Yes, 156.44. Estimate was 152.39. And then they ended the quarter with free cash flow of 960 million basically doubling the estimate of 464.1 million. Now I want to talk about their guidance here because as I said, that was a little bit light. The fourth quarter they are seeing revenue of 1.8 to 1.88 billion dollars estimate was for 1.86 billion. So just a little bit less than that. But also saying on a year over year basis, we expect nights and experiences booked growth. That growth will moderate slightly relative to Q3 2022 while ADR will face some pressure from the effects headwinds and business mix. So enough.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,89,2022-11-01 20:13:29
4594," Experiences booked growth. That growth will moderate slightly relative to Q3 2022, while ADR will face some pressure from effects headwinds and business mix. So in other words, Knights and Experiences going to flag a little bit and also experiencing some of those strong dollar problems that everybody else is talking about. Also with respect to Sherry purchases, as of the end of the quarter, they repurchase $1 billion of class A common stock. The Sherry Purchase program is going to enable them to offset delusion from their employee stock programs. And one last note, they said Q3 was their biggest and most profitable quarter ever, despite the geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds. That's a pretty big number, man, for none of the shares to be down 8% year of liquid good stuff. Thank you. Couple numbers jump out to me, Shana. Stays of 28 days or more. Those are long term stays for Airbnb's represented. 20% of their booking. That is a massive number on the backside of the pandemic. The other one is 200 million nights booked. That is a massive number after 137 million in the prior quarter, which is a pretty strong performance. Yeah, and they're also saying a jump in the number of active listings on their platform. That's up 15% year over years. Are you taking into account more people are traveling? There's more options out there. Obviously, good news here for Airbnb. The guidance that Sherry was just talking about. That is why we are seeing the stock off just around 8% after hours, but when you dig deep into what they are forecasting year over the coming quarters, it's still relatively strong. They're saying that the fourth quarter nights in experience booked. That growth is going to moderate slightly. It was up 25% this quarter on a year over your basis. So even though we had that 25% growth number, I guess the street, though, not too willing to give Airbnb any passes at this point. Average daily rates would, Jeremy was also just talking about they expected that to moderate some of that having to do with the strong dollar here. So, Michelle, I think overall, at least for the quarter, for the third quarter, very, very solid results from Airbnb here, but that guidance is really what all streets seems to be focusing on. It's true. I mean, Airbnb has managed an earnings beat now for the past six quarters. Not too many companies can say that, especially in an environment like this. And when you look at how much Airbnb has been taking some market share from some of these hotel brands that are very well known, one of the things that's supposed to actually be help fueling Airbnb's growth is this idea that they really go across different sort of market shares, different sort of travel options as well, giving them that much more diversification and say some of these big chain hotels, which are a little bit more limited. So definitely keeping an eye on Airbnb. That's sad to see that down after hours, that forward guidance clearly making it tough. All right, well, let's bring in our guests now to break down this report. We have Jed Kelly, a managing director of equity research at Oppenheimer focusing on consumer internet. So I first want to get your initial reaction to the data that's come out on the earnings for Airbnb. Yeah, I think while you're seeing the stock down as two things, one, the buy sign was a little bit above the sell side just because the third party data, particularly air DNA. It's a lot of data that the buy side used. It was it was pointing to like a 10% revenue beat. So I think that the three queue numbers caught some people off guard. And then obviously, in this environment, you can't guide to a four queue with moderating, with modest acceleration, in a higher interest rate of buyer, in a growth stocks going to settle off. And I think the problem, Airbnb is executing terrific. It's a highly valued name in this type of market. You know, even any little bit of a problem or slight acceleration is going to cause the stock to settle off. Yes, certainly. And that seems to be the case right now. Jed, when you take a look at the travel trends right now, obviously fears of alluming recession, people might be pulling back on their spending ability. I guess how do you see that impacting Airbnb? Because even when you take into account the guidance that they're giving us and something, you were just noting they still expect pretty strong numbers here, at least for the current quarter. Yeah, I think the way to think about it is, I think the key thing you want to watch, right, if you're an investor is supply, because if they can continue to increase supply, that means next year they should have enough inventory if people trade down on their trips, right? We still think people are going to travel next year. It's just they're going to trade down so you would expect some ADR compression. And if they can get enough supply.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,90,2022-11-01 20:17:35
4595," people trade down on their trips, right? We still think people are going to travel next year. It's just they're going to trade down so you would expect some ADR compression. And if they can get enough supply, there's this potential where they can make up the ADR compression with volume. You know, a lot of investors are right now. And nervous about is, you know, this is a stock that's trading at 20 times, EBITDA on 23 EBITDA estimates. And that's a high valuation. So if we go into a recession, you know, you would expect it to, you know, probably trade down to 12 to 15 times EBITDA. So there's certainly a amount of multiple and crushing risk here. Just continuing to look into backward looking for a moment because we address the guidance. I mean, 200 million book nights is up 25% from a strong quarter in Q2, which was 137 million, a pretty healthy number in terms of their growth. Yeah, they're executing flawlessly, right? Like it's awesome execution. It's, you know, it's a great company, you know, it's probably not the best stock given the risk reward if we had a jewelry session on the multiple. And, Jenna, I want to ask you about the long term stays, those stays that are at least 28 days. That made up 20% of the nights, booked a lot of people wondering with a lot more people returning to work, but this was actually going to suffer, but this continues to be a growth story for Airbnb. Do you expect that to continue? I would expect long term stays 20% to stay relatively consistent. It's been trending that way for the past couple of quarters. I think the longer term stays like over 28 days, that's normalized with people going back to work. You know, younger kids having to still have to pay rent. I mean, I think where Airbnb is benefiting, it's a little bit on the margin, you know, you're probably staying one or two extra nights, you know, say the average stays to be five, four or five nights, and now can probably be six or seven just on people being able to leverage the work from anywhere where instead of having to fly on a Friday, come back on a Monday, I can now fly on a Thursday and come back on a Tuesday, because I have a little more leeway, right? That's where they're benefiting, but on the 28 days or more, I would expect that to continue at 20%. Jedi, I have a market-perform rating on the stock right now. What's it going to take to get you off the sidelines and more bullish on this name? It's more just, it's hard to get in front of this and upgrade it if we have a technical recession. You just looked back to 0809, price line, which was growing rooms, 50%, 60%, is multiple compressed to 10 times. I think if we go into a recession, Airbnb's multiple to get pressed to 12 to 50 times, which is $80 on a name, so, you know, it's still 20% downside. But do you see anything in this report that gives you a better sense of the macro environment that there could be a recession around the corner? No, I mean, all the travel names are not gonna give you, I had the airlines came out two weeks ago and said, demand's strong, right? Southwest came out last week, and they're guiding for 4Q revenue acceleration. There's nothing that the travel services of travel is telling you right now that we're heading for a recession. It's just a big unknown, and that's why investors are cautious because they eventually think as the Fed's goal is to raise rates to curb demand, so eventually that should see been the travel, but it hasn't yet. All right, well, a big thank you to Jet Kelly for joining us here as we're keeping an eye on the earnings data for Airbnb. All right, coming up, AMD shares are moving after hours.

4596," Music A.M.D. earnings crossing the wires right now. You can see the stock up just around 1% digging into these numbers. The revenue 5.6 billion that was basically in line with what the street was looking for. Adjusted EPS coming in at 67 cents. The estimate out there was for 65 cents. Gross margins of 42% during the quarter of capex and the third quarter, 123 million estimate from the street was 102 million. A lot of the focus so on guidance. Fourth quarter revenue guidance coming in a bit light. A.M.D. seeing 5.2 billion to 5.8 billion. The estimate was for 5.85 billion. Full year revenue forecast of 23.2 billion to 23.8 billion. The initials saw 26 to 26.6 billion. Of course we did get a warning from A.M.D. about a month ago, four weeks ago when the company pre-liminary announced their pre-glim results. A fourth and third quarter warning of a shortfall on weaker PC demand also supply chain issues. Maybe some of this bad news has already been baked into this stock. Well, let's talk about it with Angelizino CFRA Senior Equity Analyst. And Angela, I guess comparing what we got four weeks ago to what we're getting this afternoon. What's your takeaway from the third quarter for A.M.D.? Yeah. Listen, as far as the third quarter numbers are concerned, I mean, you kind of, you know, throw that some of the numbers out there, but pretty much in line with expectations in terms of the revenue number, group 29% year of a year, non-gap gross margin number, about 50%. So, you know, pretty much right there where the expectation was across kind of all business lines as well. Really kind of that hurt in the quarter. Really came from their PC centric business, you know, declining more than 50% sequentially. So, you know, I'd expect to see more pain here in Q4, but as far as, you know, to what you alluded to in terms of the guidance for the fourth quarter. I mean, that's where all eyes are. And I'd say, this is more of a better than feared type of number when we kind of look at it, still going to continue to grow year over year. Of course, they did the, the silence acquisition earlier in a year, but nonetheless, it looks like their data centric business looks like it's going to continue to grow here in the fourth quarter. And that's really kind of what investors care most about as far as A.M.D.'s concerns. So, again, it's, I think it's a better than feared type of number here in guidance. There's a lot of questions, Angela, about gaining market share against Intel. Any read into that? Yeah. I mean, it's, it's really hard to kind of read into it, but when you kind of just look at the numbers on the surface, I mean, A.M.D.'s rolling out some kind of next-gen chips here. And that's a couple quarters ramping up to five minutes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,92,2022-11-01 20:26:33
4597," Part to kind of read into it, but when you kind of just look at the numbers on the surface, I mean AMD is rolling out some kind of next-gen ships here in the next couple quarters, ramping up their five nanometer technology on the CPU data center side of things. And you know, from what we're seeing in terms of, you know, the guidance in Q4 and what we expect into 2023, we do think AMD continues to incrementally take more share from Intel here. And we know that chip makers have been under pressure so far this year. What do you think is going to give AMD the edge of its competitors? I think as far as kind of AMD is concerned, I think the biggest fear out there with investors is of course, you know, one is, you know, whether or not they can continue to, you know, continue the momentum on the market share side of things. I mean, we are clearly seeing, I'd say, an environment right now where we've seen, we've gone from a consumer-led inventory industry downturn within the semiconductor industry to one that's kind of spilled across all end markets, excluding automotive. And when you kind of look at the numbers here and what we expect out of AMD and the coming quarters, we do kind of think this transition into some of their next technology knows. We think they're going to continue to maintain an advantage over Intel on the CPU side of things here over the next two years at the very least. But I think the concern out there is from a competitive landscape is does Intel potentially catch up with some of the investments that they're making? And Nvidia also is expected to kind of get into the CPU data center side of things. And could they potentially crack that market? It's not something we expect in 2023 because this is, you know, they're kind of just now entering the market. But it is something to kind of keep an eye on. But as we sit here today and what we expected, what we think they have kind of in the pipeline on the data center side of things, we do think they're better positioned than peers at least through 2023. Angela, supply chain issues has long been a huge challenge for AMD, a large challenge really for the sector over the last several quarters from your checks. I guess how does AMD compare to some of its competitors and has that situation significantly improved at all? It has significantly improved. I mean, a lot of it, you know, clearly is because of some of the demand or destruction that we've seen from a lot of these end markets that AMD serves. But yeah, I mean, for the most part, whether it be, you know, clearly in the PC side of things, I don't think we have to talk about supply constraints anymore. And, you know, also on the data center side of things, I mean, there are a couple of components out there that continue to be a bit supply constraint. But for the most part, I think we're kind of out of the woods there. I think, you know, when you start thinking about supply constraints anywhere, it's more on the auto side of things, you know, in certain kind of pain points there. But, you know, not really a market that AMD has significant exposure to. All right, Angela, Zeno, CFRA, good to see you, sir. Thank you. All right. Paramount releases third quarter results tomorrow with the group's penetration and the streaming market front of mind for investors joining us now with what we should expect from those results. As Yahoo, finances, Ali Canal getting set for World Series. But Ali first paramount. Where is Dave? Where am I supposed to spread? I know you're a little bit more excited for this series, but tell us what do you expect from Paramount? Yes, yes. Paramount earnings before the bell tomorrow. Here's what Wall Street expects right now revenue estimates coming in at just over seven billion. That's the estimate with adjusted earnings set at 46 cents per share. Paramount plus subscriber net additions are expected to surge by 3.25 million this quarter. But there is caution on the street, Wells Fargo analysts, Stephen K Hall downgraded the stock from equal weight to underperform, citing concerns surrounding increased court cutting and streaming profitability. He suggested that paramount become an arms dealer of sorts similar to what we've seen from Sony, maybe license that content to third parties or even sell off some of those assets. And the company did warn that streaming losses will accelerate. It's expected to reach 1.8 billion in 2022. The potential for that number to surge even more in 2023. Nevertheless, I did have the chance to speak with CEO Bob Backish during Yahoo finances. Oh.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,93,2022-11-01 20:30:40
4598," 2022, the potential for that number to surge even more in 2023. Nevertheless, I did at the chance to speak with CEO Bob Backish during Yahoo finances all market summit a couple weeks ago and he struck a pretty bullish tone. Take a listen to what he had to say. We've always had a plan to build a robust streaming business, but a profitable streaming business. Our business is only a year and a half old takes a little while. We always said peak investment year is 2023. It still is. But we are building a business that we see as a as over time having TV media like margins. So he's optimistic. I will say that direct to consumer does seem to be top of mind at this company, especially amid recent advancements in the landscape overall. Just earlier today, we heard that YouTube will launch a new feature called prime time channels that will allow consumers to subscribe to over 30 services within the YouTube app. So very similar to Roku, Paramount Plus is part of that roll out and it's currently the most subscribed to service on the platform. So the company really trying to take advantage of what they can to grow and subscriber base, but the big question on Wall Street is will that be enough? And Ali, of course, another story in the streaming space, music streaming, but Amazon now they had a big announcement today. Yeah, Amazon announced that prime members can access for no additional cost of full music catalog with 100 million songs up very significantly from the previous two million members will also have access to top podcasts without ads. And that's key here. It seems to be a big shot directed at Spotify, which we know has been steadily increasing its podcasts offerings, although ads do interrupt a lot of those shows, which has been frustrating to users. I think overall, this makes it pretty clear that Amazon is looking to increase that platform stickiness, keep consumers within that ecosystem. We know that revenue growth has slowed at the company. And when you offer incentives like Thursday and a football on Amazon, primary, even original content like board of the rings, those signups will come. So this is just another example of that strategy. The ecosystem just keeps getting bigger. Ali Canal, thank you so much. All right, coming up Elon Musk, not only focusing on Twitter these days, Tesla appears to be finally ready to ramp up production of its long awaited cyber truck, when you can expect to see it on the road.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,94,2022-11-01 20:35:12
4599,".. All right. Some more earnings results breaking. We can see shares of micro strategies up more than 1% despite posting a third quarter loss. Something of a reversal for Bitcoin in recent months. If you may notice, we're about a 20,500 around that number. The group's digital assets currently standard. $1.99 billion, David Hollerith here with the results, David. What are we learning? Yeah. You know, the last quarter, Bitcoin didn't actually, it wasn't actually very volatile. And for a micro strategy, that appears to have panned out pretty well. Its Bitcoin holdings are less, more or less unchanged. We're seeing about a $700,000 impairment charge, which is a far cry from its 917 million impairment charge from Q2. So in terms of its Bitcoin holdings, which is accounts for the majority of sort of how this company performs and trades, it's looking much better than last quarter. In terms of revenue, micro strategy came in light. Its earnings per share actually beat estimates and coming in at 96 cents versus the estimate of 44 cents. The gap holdings of its digital assets, as I mentioned, the total impairment is 1.9 billion. And that's meaning that the value of its Bitcoin holdings is 1.98 billion. So it's lost roughly half its value since it started acquiring Bitcoin. And obviously, that's all unrealized. But a note of point that's a more interesting thing to look at in the earnings releases that the company did say that it was optimistic about the financial standards accounting board changing how Bitcoin is accounted for on the balance sheet. They've been in talks about this for a month of the year. And that looks like that decision is coming to a close. And in that scenario, these huge losses we're seeing from micro strategies hoarding in quarters would be eliminated. So we cut out a lot of the noise here. But again, not a lot of noise from this quarter. They look pretty much a little changed. shares up about 3% on this news down still about 54% year to date. David Holler, thanks so much. Appreciate that. Chana. All right, Tesla reportedly updating its timeline for the cyber truck now according to a report from Reuters and mass production. The long awaited EV is expected to start at the end of next year. So you'll remember the vehicle boasted unbreakable armor, glass windows. That didn't exactly end well on stage. I heard a Elon Musk back in 2019. How can we forget that now everyone who paid to reserve a Tesla cyber truck is going to have to wait another year. Dave, and that is if they meet that target assumes like at least as of late, the pattern has been pushing back some of their goals, just in terms of being able to meet their production lofty goals. So that you can say at this point, people may have put down 100 bucks, but still it garnered a lot of attention. Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands people did pay that 100 bucks. So they are going to be waiting quite some time now. It sounds like possibly even more to get their hands on the dude. As our investors, if this is part of their investor story, now you're looking at probably Q2 2024. If you're factoring that in at all. And yet to your point, Reuters has hundreds of thousands and Elon did comment saying there had more orders of the cyber.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,95,2022-11-01 20:39:26
4600," 24, if you're factoring that in at all. And yet to your point, Reuters has hundreds of thousands and Elon did comment saying there had more orders of the cyber truck than we could possibly fulfill for three years after the start of production. So it's, look, it's Fumihwan Shamanu, Fumihwan Shamanu. What is Fumih three times? And that's what we're on now. The third time that we have pushed this off, there's even a phrase for that. So I guess just wake me up when this is all over. I have another question though, what the price tag will be for this cyber truck. That's a big one, Rochelle. The last we heard, he was open for $40,000. That was in 2019, an entirely different world in which we live now. Hard to imagine that price anywhere close to that number. And when you speak about the delays in you mentioned that price, $40,000, well, when you think of the formula F-150 electric truck, the lightning that came to market fast, while the cyber truck was still waiting to come on, they already had to raise prices up nearly 11% or a 30% increase of the truck's price now at about $51,000. They also had originally priced theirs at about $40,000. So I definitely don't think you're going to be getting this cyber truck anywhere near $40,000. But you know, all these delays, it's given a lot more room for competitors to sort of squeeze in there with these electric pickups. And as we've said before, still really not sure who's in the market for a cyber truck. It might not be your classic F-150 purchases. So we'll have to see. But clearly a lot of buzz. We'll see if it pans out. Here's what they did. You actually fall in that F-150. That's your dream car. Oh, I don't think you're buying this. Are you buying this after a day in this? I'm not getting the weirdest thing now. I'm like, you're not getting it. No, for the F-150 all the way, my friend. But it looks cool. It looks cool. All right, we'll have to leave it there. But coming up, Hurricane Ian has not cooled down. One of Florida's emerging housing markets. They tuned to find out why.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,96,2022-11-01 20:44:20
4601," With mortgage rates rising and prices still high, many home buyers and sellers are waiting to pull the trigger. Though some markets are seeing growth in demand, as we can see here like Sarasota, Florida, which ranks fourth in the Wall Street Journal Emerging Markets Index for the fall. Brandy, Fawren, CEO and Lead Listing Specialists of the Furland Group joins us now. Thank you for joining us. What are you seeing on the ground in terms of how things have changed as we're seeing some of these mortgage rates continuing to creep up? Hi, thank you for having me. Appreciate this. We are actually seeing more listings and more inventory grow since COVID stopped. We started to slow down roughly around April or May. We started to see the slow down. So anyone that put their home on the market after May has seen a tremendous downslide, well, I shouldn't say tremendous. It really ranges depending on the area, different percentages in different areas. We are seeing homes come on the market more than ever, where before sellers were afraid to put their home on the market, as they didn't know where they would buy or if they would be able to negotiate, I'm sort of surprised because a lot of the sellers that I've listed did refinance their house to the low 3 and 4%. And yet they're willing and able to and ready to move and pay a higher interest rate. So mostly it's because they have a need to move. It's not a want. Interesting. You don't see that often. What was the impact of Hurricane E in there on the Syrias Total Market? For a few days, of course, you know, we had the Hurricane Sarasota was spared once again. And thankfully, however, South of us Fort Myers, not so good, Englewood as well. Several areas didn't get touched at all in Englewood or Northport. And yet one street over, they had a lot of damage. So it just depends on who they are or what their need is again, because I spoke to several sellers over the past week that said they were waiting on estimators to come back and give estimates, but that they did want to sell and to call them back in about a month. So what is that doing in terms of inventory and some of the movement and the trends that you're seeing now? Well, inventory sitting where we're seeing an average of about 66 days in Sarasota County and in some parts of the city and in Brayton, we're seeing roughly 45 days to 75 days. Well, a lot longer than I might have expected. One of the biggest questions they're impacting your real estate has been the homeowners insurance. Some feel this is the year it absolutely collapses. What's been the impact there and what are the fears ahead? You know, we are finding insurance where with as long as it's 10 years or newer, there's plenty of carriers out there willing to take care of that. We do have roopers that are willing to replace a roof while a house is on the market and under contract and we'll wait to get paid when it closes. So we're able to satisfy that a couple of times just recently. We had a buyer and a seller negotiate to split the cost of the roof and have it done before it closes so that the lender will give them financing and insurance. And, Brandy, we know that some of these buyers are having to be picky. And now before it was sort of all cash offers, waving all sorts of things, now they're going to be a little bit more cautious though. But what are you seeing in terms of the influx that you're seeing with this pickiness, what comes with that? What are sellers having to do right now? Well, I call it, so I've been selling real estate since 95 and even then before the boom and after the boom back then and now we're back to it's a price war and a beauty competition. Where the last two years, it did not matter what your home looked like. So now sellers are needing to follow our checklist and get the house prepared. And where is the action there? Is it at the higher end or the lower end of the market and why do you think? The higher end market, anything over 300,000 is sitting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doe_i8TBvqg,97,2022-11-01 20:48:02
4602," in there, is it at the higher end or the lower end of the market and why do you think? The higher end market, anything over 300,000 is sitting a little bit longer. Sellers are coming down on their price. A lot of the reason is because the sellers are still not aware or willing to accept the new market that we're in. And the investors are, as far as the lower price homes, 300 or under, we're still seeing multiple offers and those are moving much faster. Anything over 300,000, they're sitting. And I think it has something to do with the interest rates, how they're not doing so well either. So that's affecting a lot of the cash buyers and those that we're willing to pay cash rather than get alone. Even, well, let me backup. So when the rates were the three and four percent, we had way more, far more cash buyers than we do now. And now that the rates are higher, we have less cash buyers. So we are talking about about this, like, where did the cash buyers go? Why are they not jumping on this now and paying cash? You know, it's really interesting. And, Brandy, just quickly, we know that the Fed isn't going to slow in terms of raising interest rates at least for now. What does that mean for your business and for you think the housing market in your region, as we can expect, perhaps, more of a crisis to keep rising? You know, the interest rates have been six and seven eight percent for the last, on average, seven percent for the last 20 years. And so I've seen it, you know, home sell, whether it was now three percent or eight and a half percent or even nine percent. So at the end of the day, people are always going to need to buy and sell real estate. There's always going to be that desire. If you're an investor, it doesn't matter what the interest rate is, as long as they can cover itself, the rent can cover itself. And, you know, what we're telling our buyers now is that you're not marrying the mortgage, you're marrying the house. So buy the house that you love. And, you know, as long as you can wait it out, or a lot of times we're getting sellers now to offer two one buy downs, buying down the interest rate for two years, and then lenders are offering to refinance for free within 24 months. So we're just sharing, we have to educate the buyers a little bit better on on what their options are, what kind of loan programs are out there, and, and educate our sellers on what their options are to offer the buyers to attract more buyers. It's really interesting dynamics there in that part of the country. Thank you so much, Brandy Ferlin. Appreciate that. I had over to Sean and Al what's moving after hours, my friend. We have quite a number of stocks moving after our days. Dave, a lot of it has to do with the earnings that we've gotten over the last half an hour or so. So we have Airbnb, AMD, Mondaleys, EA, and Match Group. Let's kick it off with Airbnb again. The stock off just around 4% after hours. A lot of that movement has to do with the guidance that we just got from the company. They say that they expect fourth quarter nights and experiences booked back growth to moderate slightly this month. We saw 25% growth in that division there. They also expect average daily rates to moderate. They also pointed to some headwinds when it has to do with the strong dollar. Taking a look though at the current quarter at the most recent quarters results, most profitable quarter on record here for the company revenue. Also beating the streets expectation. Get that guidance is really what's weighing on shares off just about 4% over the past three months. The stock has been essentially flat down nearly 2% year to date, though, but of a different story. You can see the losses there will shares off about a 35%. Let's take a look at AMD. That stock moving here after hours up just about 2% some of the bad news had already been baked in. We got pre-limits results from AMD about four weeks ago. If you take a look at the two-month chart, you can really see the drop in the stock shortly after they were announced. And we've traded pretty flat ever since then. So here we are today. We close at 59.66 in terms of the numbers that we got revenue 5.6 billion adjusted DPS. 67 cents. That was actually better than what the street was looking for. But fourth quarter revenue guidance coming in a bit light 5.2 billion to 5.8 billion. We just talked to Angela Zeno. He's a CFRA and he was saying that it was actually better than fear to even though missed Wall Street expectations. Many on the street were bracing for worse. So that explains the 2% move to the upside that we're seeing after hours. Let's take a look at Mondaleese International moving to the upside jumping just around 3.5%. So off the highs that we just saw a couple of minutes ago.

So off the highs that we just saw a couple of minutes ago, moving to the upside after raising its organic growth outlook for the quarter revenue of 7.76 billion. That was better than what the street was looking for. EPS of 74 cents. North America revenue 19.6 percent. Did you look the two-month chart the stock has been essentially flat over the past three months off just around nearly a five percent 61 87 a share. Yeah, electronic arts out with results here. Some of their guidance coming in a bit light. That's why we're seeing the stock off just around 1.4 percent. Net booking guidance for the full year, missing the street's expectations for the fiscal second quarter. That's the numbers that we just got. Net booking's 1.75 billion. A slightly light there adjusted EPS beating though at $1.45 revenue 1.9 billion. And wrapping up with match, you can see that stock popping after hours. We're up just around 10 percent now. But nearly 13 percent revenue 809.5 million. That was better than what the street was looking for. EPS a bit light. 44 cents. But it looks like the street's really focusing on that revenue beat. We're seeing shares move to the upside over the past three months. Stock off just about 40 percent. Dave. Okay, Sean, a good stuff. Thank you. My stock to watch for Wednesday, Fed day is Yum Brands. The variant company of Taco Bell KFC and Pizza Hut. Yum reports Q3 earnings tomorrow, head of the open. The expectation adjusted earnings of $1.15 for share on revenue of $1.63 billion. Global. Same store sales expected to rise 2.13 percent. Driven by strength at Taco Bell in particular, thanks to its low prices.

4604," Taylor Swift making music history today announcing she's going back on tour after a five-year break. Taylor kicking off the Aristor March 18th in Glendale, Arizona. Fans are already in a digital line to register for pre-sale tickets. Yeah, they're paying some big bucks. Swift also making more headlines after the singer's songwriter became the first artist to claim all top 10 spots on Billboard's Hot 100 Chart. Remarkable, truly. The previous record was held by rapper Drake who had nine of Billboard's Hot 100 Top 10 Songs for a weekend, September 2021. Michelle, that blew my mind when I first read that headline just to think because usually we're used to a system in which she released one hit at a time and kind of wait that out. She has broken all the rules of music and she's doing it her way and thoroughly dominating financially. I mean, I feel like the rules of music have really changed especially over the pandemic and this was an album that she wrote over the course of the pandemic. I added it into my playlist rainy days staring out of a window because it's very moody. It's a really fantastic album. I was on vacation and I still made sure that I listened to it. But for her to still be making music like this and really dominating just out of the blue like this, I think it's a testament to the sort of music that she puts out. And this airsta is really going to be a journey through her entire career past and present. So you're not just going to be hearing the new album. You're also going to be getting a really good mix of everything. I mean, this is an incredible feat. I say, a good for her. I'm excited for it. I don't know how much I'd be willing to spend though, but I think there's a lot of excitement. I think people, I think we're going to be shocked by how expensive some of these tickets get just in terms of the range that she has, the number of fans, she hasn't been on tour now for years. They've been waiting for us quite some time. A lot of excitement out there. We'll show. Indeed. Get your money ready. Well, that'll do it for us. But be sure to tune into Yahoo!

4607," do to reinvigorate the revenue line as they continue to pour money into the metaverse. But to me, you know, this is very similar to what we saw with second life almost a decade ago, where there was an initial spur and then it fizzled. The question that I struggle with when it comes to the metaverse is what is the killer app? Why will people go and continue to go in mass and how do they drive revenue? Not just meta, but really anybody. And I don't think it's really the, I don't think the answer is there yet. Just to follow on that with the kind of present nature of the vacuum of easy money policies, does the metaverse actually become a reality? I think it, well, look, anytime we have these new technologies, right? And I'm going to date myself here a little bit Brad. So back in 1999, 2000, when I was a younger man, I heard all about 3G, 3G is coming, 3G is going to revolutionize everything. And it's going to be here next year. And it took several years for 3G not only to really have the networks built the devices there, but for the applications to emerge that really drove the incremental average revenue per user that carriers were booking. So I think we're going to see that again. You know, and will it happen? Yes, I think like autonomous cars and everything else at the timeline is just going to be a lot longer than we originally think. 3G in second life, you're really taking me back here. So within technology, then what is more attractive to you? If you're looking specifically in that, you know, does it, does it pay to stay more boring for lack of a better word right now? Well, you know, it's an interesting question. And I say that because, you know, over the last several months, you know, in the actual, excuse me, action alerts plus portfolio that we run for the street, we've actually exited a number of technology companies. You know, when we took the portfolio over, it was over invested in technology. You know, again, this was about a year ago. And we've whittled that away. And the landscape, I think, is a little murky right now to be kind. You know, we heard what AMD said last night. Data Center looks like it's holding up better. PC continues to be worse. You know, we're hearing repeated conversations about slowing smartphone sales. So it's hard to get excited about technology. And I know some people will come out and they'll say, well, you know, these stocks are cheap. And my reply is Brian will probably guess is, you know, when I put my analyst hat on is, well, how are they cheap when I don't really know what the E is or I don't know what the S is in price to sales because those numbers are coming down. So I, you know, I want to like technology because it does have a lot of, you know, disruptive and productivity plays. But I don't think we're there yet, Julie. Chris, what about industrials then? So industrials are an interesting way to look at it. You know, I used to cover that back in my early days. And it's a very wide category. You know, so you can have everything from trucks and rails to construction equipment and ag equipment. I think those latter two are a lot more interesting. Construction equipment, you know, caterpillar, plus some great numbers with your US construction business in the September quarter. We're starting to see some of the benefits flow through for demand on the Biden infrastructure law. That's why we like United Reynolds. We like Volcano materials as well. And that thesis was really confirmed this morning by what merit, excuse me, Martin Marietta had to say. So we like those. And then on the ag equipment side, look, farmer income is killing it. And when historically when that happens, they tend to replace their equipment. We also have, if you want to talk, you know, a little bit of technology, this real push and precision ag, you know, farmers are struggling with high fertilizer costs. I think that's going to accelerate that move. Interesting. Love to talk some precision ag. We'll do it at more length another time, Chris. Thanks so much, Chris Versace. I'm not even kidding. Tomato Gare Research Chief Investment Officer. Thank you. Thanks. Coming up, Sass is going to share the top things he said should terrify. I thought we went with worry, but okay, terrify school.

4608," [♪intro music plays === Today is indeed a Fed decision day in America. And while investors are obsessing over what the Fed says and doesn't say, the reality is that today's borrowing costs will be headed even higher after what the Fed unveils this afternoon. And that can spell bad news for retailers of all kinds. This holiday season saws at the great end. It's a little downer. Yeah. Well, it's the reality. So, first graphic here up in this is, you know, we're getting more or increasing signs of a lot of consumer weakness and it's starting to pick up. We've been talking about this past two weeks as these warnings have come. First, whirlpool, cut its guidance. You have Generac, the Generator Maker, warning about bloated inventories despite hurricane season, which theoretically should be causing more generator sales nonetheless. You have deck maker treks like we talked about yesterday. They're seeing sales or they saw sales in a third quarter flat out plunge, terrible outlook. American Express, when I talk to CEO Steven Squarie about a week and a half ago when they reported earnings, touch of caution in their full year outlook, not dire by anybody by any means, but still some red flags there. Bank of America, when I talked to Brian Monahan, the CEO of that company, noting that card spending through October, up 10%, but that was a little bit, just a little bit slow rate than what they saw coming out of the third quarter. Just a little red flags, but now we have a couple charts here. First off, speaking of B O V A, they put out a lot of good data on card spending. You could see really card spending among B O V A customers has started to weaken a little bit during the holiday season. Now, is it falling off a map? No, of course not. But when you're trying to put the pieces together and think about how you should be investing into the holiday season or investing into next year, you have to take all these pieces and think about them. I think consumers are also reminiscent of recessions passed or economic downturns passed and trying to take a different approach perhaps, reading their wallets, reading their credit as well to be able to sustain through a period like that, which means kind of the vacuum of some of that spending, at least in portion over time. It's not just, there's a lot of focus on low income shoppers, middle income consumers, but look at this next card from B O V A. It shows consumer sentiment by income group. Really, this card I think signifies that the plunge in the market this year may start to impact the market. Hold on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,2,2022-11-02 13:56:21
4609," Could this next chart from B of A, it shows consumer sentiment by income group. And really this chart I think signifies that the plunge in the market this year may start to impact consumer spending amongst wealthier households this holiday season. I haven't seen it within luxury goods. Maybe this SD-loader quarter today is a sign of what could be to come from hiring, come shoppers this holiday season. They'll still be out there shopping, but maybe not at the rate the market thinks. Yeah, and that's not surprising to me because of what's happened with the market, right? In other words, the top third of income have the most invested in stocks and stocks on the year have not done that well. Yeah, and lastly, we're tracking also city, this comes from city group, restaurant sales. Restaurant sales again, no big falling off a cliff here, but still a steady decline. We saw even McDonald's had a great quarter, but they're trafficked to the restaurants under a little bit pressure. We talked to Wingstop yesterday, good quarter, traffic a little bit under pressure. Dinebrads reported earnings today, I'm talking to CEO John Payton a little bit later on, but sales there were under a little pressure as well. I don't look like the traffic was up above 2019 in that chart now. Yeah, I mean relative to then, but it is not spiking, it is not going up, theoretically you want to see these things going up. Overall, here's my take, I think you're going to see more retail blowups coming very soon. As these companies report earnings throughout November, they're sent to saws coming out of the chimney. It will start early on next week. We'll get some results, I believe out of tapestry, some high income companies, and then Walmart target you name a little report. I mean, this is in line with what we heard from Lorraine Hutchison yesterday over at Bank of America, where she in particular was highlighting the inventory numbers, which continued to be alarming. She inspired me to do this because I, her comments were very on the mark. Yeah. On the mark. We had Santos saws there, but it had a Grinch tenor if you would have said so. Yeah, we should have had a green. I want to be Grinch, I just want to be happy. I just want to be happy guys. Well, then stop telling me, you're going to be terrible. I'm sorry, son. Coming up, we're going to break down some of the market action and more big earnings reports from Aramount, Match Group, and the A-Sports. It's in the game. Oh, I just, I was just going to do that show in the game. Here you go. Till the next reaction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,3,2022-11-02 14:00:33
4610," I'm fond of Apple's Food Box Super Bow my son have I been recording vlogs about this food box viewer and the internet as well T Guys. Is this a holiday house? Yes Hotnovs will do. Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Saussing. Looks like Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. And we're just a few hours away from the Fed's latest decision on interest rates, FOMC officials for seeing hiking rates by another 75 basis points right now we're seeing markets really tiptoe in that Fed decision, all three major indices slightly in the red. Now here's what else is on tap for this hour. Tuning into Paramount. Yowl Finance's Ali Canal has some instant analysis on earnings results out of Paramount, which was also whacked by a Wells Fargo downgrade earlier in the week. And swiping the plastic, I talk with Mastercard CEO Michael Mebach on why he doesn't see a cold-filled holiday shopping season. And CEO ChatFest will also check in with the CEO's XPO, Travago and Rockwell automation to get a pulse on the global economy in two year end. Brad, over to you. All right, thanks so much. Big Fed day. We're going to get to the decision later on this afternoon. We're taking a look at how the major averages are moving on today's session going into that announcement. And then the press conference as well. You're seeing the Dow down by about four tenths of a percent. Let's set the mood with some candlesticks here and take a look at some of the larger movements that have been taking place there. Also getting just another look at some of the other major averages here on the day. We'll try to get markets back later on. Oh, there they are. Okay. Well, anyway, we've moved on. We're going over to sectors right now. Sector's on the day. As we had seen some major laggards throughout the early morning session. We've now seen all 11 S&P 500 sectors in negative territory, moving to negative territory. Financials has also slipped into the red. That's flat, but to the downside. Take a look as well at consumer discretionary as we've been tracking that. That's down by about three tenths of a percent. And with that in mind, want to take a look at some of the retail names as I've been tracking those. And you've got a lot of red in retail right now. Amazon hyperwifling, Walmart, down half a percent, some depot down four tenths of a percent. And take a look at the declines and lows moving lower on the day by about one percent. Also, you've got a host of others just to put this in broader perspective here at some of the declines on the day. You've got, of course, bedbath and beyond as well. That's down by about one percent right now. Julie, what do you think you very much, Brad? And we're also watching shares of Paramount that are down about nine percent after an earnings miss as investments in its content marketing and international expansions bite with a recap of the media giant's earnings and the broader streaming landscape. We've got our own alley canal joining us right now. So, Ali, tell us about this quarter and what stands out and what happened. Yeah. Well, good morning, Julie. It's very clear investors are not too happy about this. Amiss on both the top and bottom lines. As you mentioned, profits really suffered as a result of those greater investments in marketing content, international expansion, which Paramount has been really committed to week advertising revenue as well. That declined to 2% in the quarter. That's a big macroeconomic challenge at the industry as a whole has been grappling with that weight on the company's bottom line CEO Bob Backish, though. He focused on the company's subscriber wins for the quarter. We did see a significant amount of growth Paramount plus adding 4.6 million subs for a total of 46 million Pluto TV also seeing continued success with 72 million monthly active users. And as a whole, the company has nearly 67 million subscribers across its direct to consumer services. And executives said that there's more room to run here. The problem, though, that Wall Street seems to have is on the profit side. Can DTC alone save Paramount amid these linear TV challenges? We heard from Wells Fargo Steve K Hall earlier this week. He issued a second downgrade in less than a month on the stock. He suggested that Paramount take on the role of an arms dealer, similar to what we've seen from Sony, maybe license out or sell off some of those assets. Bob Backish was specifically asked about this strategy on the earnings call. But he said that's not really part of their vision. He's really committed to keeping content on the platform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,4,2022-11-02 14:04:45
4611," part of their vision, he's really committed to keeping content on the platform. He says that's ultimately how you deliver value. Backage also confirming that price hikes will be coming. He actually said this on our air during Yahoo finances all market summit. No timeline has been given on that, but that's something to look out for as well. Overall, though, investors really struggling to find that silver lining shares seem to be accelerating their losses a bit down over 9.5%. Allie, while we have you and we're zeroing in on the entertainment landscape, Netflix's ad supported tier that launching now to do we have a sense of where some of the conversations around where the what's actual content will be on that ad tier are starting to net out. Yeah, this is a big point of conversation right now. This ad tier launching officially in the US tomorrow and the company did warn that about 5 to 10% of programming will not be available on this ad tier due to ongoing conversations surrounding the rights to air ads against some of this content. The Wall Street Journal confirming that those talks are still ongoing with several major studios and that includes some big guys are sitting on your screen now Disney NBC Universal Sony Pictures Warner Brothers Discovery Lionsgate. Some of these studios provide original content to Netflix. Others offer reruns, license their content. We're talking about some pretty big shows here, Grey's Anatomy, the Crown, you. So it's very important that Netflix can get this right experts that I've spoken with have said advertising is a future for this company as it competes for subscribers and the revenue that comes along with that. We have Disney's ad tier coming out next month. Many players in this space already. So Netflix really trying to take a bite out of that market share. But in order to do that, you have to have the content of both the user side and the advertising side. So this is something that we will have to watch very closely. It says ad tier rolls out. All right, nobody let Penn bachelor know that he might not be on the ad supported tier. He might get upset. We know what happens then. Thanks so much. Allie Canal. We appreciate it. Switching gears everyone investors saying it's a match as dating app specialist match group reported and earnings beat the company which owns popular services including Tinder, Inge and Match.com saw a boost in users and subscriptions in Tinder. That's just even as a widening or weakening global economy threatens some of the spending here particularly from its lower income consumers. But this is notable especially given how the reopening would certainly thrust a lot of attention towards people who were just looking to get back out and year over year that was the construct how much of the reopening in 2021 in Q3 back then would actually protrude or permeate over into 2022 and remain kind of this normalized level. I guess the only thing I can really add here is this love is not recession proof. I mean really if you if you've lost a job recently you don't have money to go spend $200 on a date night. That's how I read this quarter. Yeah I mean so the company last quarter was not great right in terms of the earnings in particular and so this reminds me oddly of Intel a little bit where right where basically the company comes out and says we're going to be disciplined on headcount. We're going to be disciplined on expenses and that seems to be in this environment what the street wants to hear. These reassurances that these companies are reading the room so to speak and that they understand that we're going into a tricky time. So that seems to be the sort of big picture here of why matches reacting so well to this report. You wouldn't think that Intel and and match would have much in common but there that's the theme I see at least. I'm getting I'm well I don't think Tinder I think there was weakness throughout this report. I think they highlighted that really through it they lost customers in some parts of the business. Well for match for Bumble all of them are trying to build up the amount of revenue that they're seeing on each individual users by offering some of the incremental kind of add-on costs whether that's being able to move yourself to the top of somebody's queue whether that's being able to say you know just send somebody a gift through the platform which to me is a little creepy but if that's your thing that should not do. Yeah I mean the the paying users here is what is going to continue to come down to where they're seeing that that paying user kind of increase and I think it's really going to come back to as well the amount of word of mouth marketing that actually takes place among those paying users because if some paying users",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,5,2022-11-02 14:09:02
4612, user kind of increase and I think it's really going to come back to as well the amount of word of mouth marketing that actually takes place among those paying users because if some paying users are saying you know what at the end of the day this is not really working for me anyway then you could see a deceleration. I mean there's also some internal stuff going on there's no permanent CEO for Tinder right now the CEO of that group left earlier in the year and they have not replaced them and so this is something that they need to work on as well so they're seeing the revenue strength. They're seeing still paying users keep up but it's this sort of preparing for maybe things that are not going to be so rosy going down coming down the pipe. Indeed. All right we're also watching electronic art shares. They're on the move. The video game maker is still confident that consumers will keep gaming despite economic headwinds for more our tech editor Dan Halley joins us. Dan I think a lot of anticipation for electronic arts I'm sure ahead of the world cup they talk a little bit about this on the earnings call last night. Yeah you know they so let's just go over the numbers real quick they had missed on earnings per share and revenue and they had seen net bookings that were 100 1.75 billion that's compared with 1.85 billion in the year ago quarter that is to kind of be expected after this huge explosion that we saw in the gaming industry throughout the pandemic so there's going to be a drop the bigger issue here I think for them is what they're expecting for the full fiscal year and they revised those numbers downward they think that they're going to get between 2.79 and 2.8 billion sorry the expected revenue was supposed to be 7.6 billion to 7.8 billion that's down 50 million from what they had previously said and then total bookings they're expecting between 7.65 and 7.85 billion that's down from the 7.9 and 8.1 billion so they're expecting less spending they're saying that that's you know a mix of things including the currency headwinds as well as people may be pulling back they did yes with the world cup they had their largest launch ever for FIFA as far as FIFA 23 goes they said they had 10.3 million players in its first week which is absolutely huge they also have other franchises that are continuing to play there's apex legends people still like that they did have their latest battlefield title come out which was who boy a absolute stinker I mean it just was not good it was broken right out of the gate and they're trying to fix that you know and you feel bad for the developers to put time into that but I mean that's just not going anywhere and then you know going forward they do have some titles coming out they have it takes 2 coming out for the Nintendo switch that's more of like a you know friendly like my wife and I would play it's not something that's going to really drive sales they have a new D for speed game coming out in December not going to be absolutely massive they have a remake of the game dead space but that's coming in January so you know there's some big games you know then you start going into further into 2023 and you know there's there's more titles there there's a new Star Wars game that tends to do well for them but you know there's nothing that I'm really seeing on their their upcoming games that really just like is going to knock my socks off I think you know their company that they're so heavily heavily reliant on their sports section and look people buy mad in every year and I don't know why I'm just why the stock is up I think the numbers and they weren't that excited the mobile numbers seem to be pretty pretty yeah but the forecats are kind of meh I don't know I think it's that they're the the mobile numbers aren't as bad as they could have been you know competition as far as games this holiday season is going to be kind of light you know the big one coming out is the new God of War game that's a PlayStation exclusive though so it's not you know going to hit on Xbox or anything anytime soon but you know I it probably is having to do it the mobile aspect and then you know it's not as bad as they thought it could be but you know like I said nothing really here that's going to knock my socks off as far as upcoming titles it's just you know Activision Blizzard still has a lot take two still has I mean look Grand Theft Auto 5 is you know 8 million years old and it's still printing money for them so as you were running through the reception of some of those core titles that many of them being household names I was looking at some data that came out yesterday called a duty modern warfare 2 has become the number one selling opening weekend ever in the franchise 800 million dollars through the first,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,6,2022-11-02 14:13:27
4613," Selling opening weekend ever in the franchise 800 million dollars through the first Three days from its release on October 28th with that in mind What do we expect of this particular holiday season as we were just breaking down where the consumers might be starting to pull back in some spending categories Is that the same in gaming as well? I think gaming, you know, they're there's always talk about is it you know Obviously everything there's talk about is it recession proof? I think with gaming in particular, you know the titles Maybe less you know at to suffer the you know actual game sales They are 60 bucks, so maybe people won't be buying as often, but there are sales, you know that are just bonkers now You know you wait a month after its title comes out and it goes from 70 bucks to 20 bucks So you know, I mean sure that means that the companies aren't you know doing as well on margin there But it does mean that the sales are going through and then the bigger thing is what they have to offer as far as Online play and then that's where your net bookings come in and that'll start to really blow up for people I think for you know activation Blizzard and call duty That's another title that just prints money for them and they're gonna have their online game That's they have the multiplayer aspect going on, but they're gonna have modern war zone two Which really blew up at the high of the pandemic or at the onset of the pandemic? This is the sequel to that I still play it every Friday again a couple of white claws and I'm gonna keep doing that So I'll be on on there as well, but you know, I think there are some titles They're gonna continue to do well really for for a lot of companies They they look at the online games and they say this is a continuing revenue stream They look at the single player games and they say it's not really gonna do as well But then honestly on balance you can look at some of these single player games and say oh they they blew everyone else out of the water So I'm looking at you know got a war racking rock and thinking that that could be one of those games So link up with me on Xbox damn. I guess I'm gonna be a gem. I can really good Baby I for a good SNES. We're always on fire. That's what we do Yeah, man gaming expert Dan Haley. Okay, before we go to break we're watching shares of Disney off paramounts Really less than expected earnings the queries Tim Nolan is out reiterating an outperform rating on the stock I had a disease November 8th earnings No one thinks Disney plus his place to show continued upside in new subscriber additions and slowing operating losses But he does voice a good bit of caution on the outlet for Disney's theme parks where attendance could be hit in 2023 if the US economy slips into a recession Coming up dollar general face a lawsuit from Ohio Julie's back with that plus a look at more of today's top headlines.

4614," How are you doing, Hello, greetings, I'll see you again on Friday from the Here's a check on some of the other headlines that we are watching starting overseas. China locking down the area around the world's largest iPhone factory for seven days due to a COVID outbreak. This moved likely to cause further disruptions in operations for Apple supplier Foxconn and then potentially spelling bad news for Apple ahead of the holiday season. Foxconn said in a statement, the plant will continue operating within a quote to close to loop or self-contained bubble that limits contact with the outside world. There were reports remember over the weekend about workers fleeing the factory because of concerns that they would be then stuck there. Chemical maker Dupont, terminating its $5.2 billion file of Rogers Corporation as a result of the company's being unable to obtain timely clearance from all required regulators. Dupont said all parties had received regulatory approvals for the merger except from that of China's state administrator for market regulation. Shares of engineering materials maker Rogers are plunging as this deal is going away. Dupont though is trading higher analyst for positive after this deal got canceled in the statement. Rogers said it is evaluating all options in response to Dupont's notice. And dollar general hit with a lawsuit as Ohio sues the US discount retailer due to several complaints regarding overcharges. These complaints come as testing last month found $20 general stores with significant pricing errors. The lawsuit seeks civil fines of $25,000 per violation, payment of actual damages to consumers, and a permanent injunction against further violations. Suss? Rockwell Automation shares down here after the company saw higher earnings and sales in the fourth quarter and issued a fiscal 2023 growth forecast. Let's bring in Rockwell Automation Chairman and CEO Blake Morett for more on this. Blake, always good to see you. Top of your earnings release. You know that organic sales in the fourth quarter up 20 and a half percent that's very big gain against a backdrop of a slowing economy. Where are those sales coming from? So we saw great sales in the fourth quarter. It was broad based. We serve a wide variety of industrial markets from automotive which had a very good quarter. Semiconductor as we're participating in the build-down of capacity there, oil and gas, renewable energy with solar energy, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, a really broad based across the spectrum. With that kind of broad based results that you have seen, where do you kind of look across the business and really identify where there is perhaps even still cost management that needs to take place at this point in time? Well, productivity is always a part of what we're doing. Even in a time like this when we're seeing double-digit growth, we saw, as you said, double-digit growth in the last fiscal year, particularly strong in the fourth quarter. And as we go forward into our fiscal year, 23 double-digit growth again with strong earnings growth as well. Now, productivity for us and for our customers always remains in style. You know, a big part of our value proposition is increased efficiency in all of these industries as well as helping them launch new lines of business. And we look inward and look for ways to be efficient ourselves. Blake, I'm trying to figure out why your shares are down, frankly. And I don't know if it was the midpoint of the private forecast, maybe being a little light of what analysts were predicting. But I also see your free cash flow was lower than some of the folks on the street were predicting at about $358 million. Can you talk to us about your cash position and how you guys are spending and or saving right now? Sure. We're traditionally a very strong converter of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,8,2022-11-02 14:22:06
4615," cash position and how you guys are spending and or saving right now. Sure, we're traditionally a very strong converter of free cash flow. And one of the things that we see in an environment like this is an increase in our inventory, particularly components work in process. As we're managing through the supply chain constraints, bringing in largely semiconductor chips, they're arriving at different times. And so we're making sure that we're bringing in that inventory so that when that last chip arrives, then we're able to get products out the door and improve the customer service and reduce lead times to customers. The downside of that is that higher inventory is reflected in higher working capital, which has a negative impact on free cash flow. Blake, I mentioned before your organic sales in this four in the fourth quarter, you just completed up 20 and a half percent, but your outlook for the next 12 months, you see organic sales up 9% to 13%. How is this current quarter started? Current quarter has started in line with our expectation. So our quarter began October 1. And so far, the quarter in terms of orders and shipments is developing in line with expectations. I want to also mention, you know, in an environment like this, there's continued volatility while we expect a gradual improvement in the supply chain and specifically around semiconductor availability for the types of node technologies that we use. We still believe a conservative approach is appropriate as we introduce guide for the year. I'm also curious about whether a conservative approach is warranted on things like headcount. I noticed in the statement, you talked about that you're committed to investing in attracting and retaining key talent. How are you thinking about workforce and headcount right now? Are you sort of holding the line on numbers, but still focused on getting the best people in their house that work? Well, we always focus on getting the best people in and obviously making sure that we're an attractive destination for talent in always. In compensation is certainly a part of that. Increase amounts of equity as a part of total rewards and all the other things that make Rockwell a great place to work. And with a continued low unemployment, then we recognize that talent, especially in some of the most high demand jobs, have a lot of choices. And it's a fundamental part of our culture to consider all the other choices that an employee like a customer can go and to make sure that we match up really well. Blake, good to see you. Blake, Marette is Rockwell Automation CEO. Thanks so much. Thank you. Coming up, XPO has officially launched its spin off our XO. We're going to speak to the new CEO of XPO. Let's count on up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,9,2022-11-02 14:26:30
4616, next.... Lexington. XBO now an independent company after spinning off its truckload brokerage business RXO and also we've got a new CEO for XBO that's Mario Haric and he is joining us now Mario. Full disclosure you and I chatted a little bit last night at a reception at the NYSE following the formal spin off here and we of course have talked to Brad Jacobs who is now stepping down as the CEO of the company about the rationale behind what's going on but just to take a step back we have talked so much about the broader economic landscape we've talked a lot about the buildup that we've seen in inventories and a lot of industries what are you guys seeing across the country in terms of the flows of goods. Julie it was great seeing you and thanks thanks for having me on so we are seeing a softer macro this year than what we saw last year and we're hearing mixed feedback from our customers today our less than truckload business is two-third industrial companies and we're seeing some of these companies having more product flow through their supply chain so they're ending up shipping more product while other are seeing softer than n and on the retail side it's similar a similar feedback now the said you wouldn't see it in our numbers we delivered a great third quarter but we delivered record EBTA we grew our and in our LTL business we delivered record revenue and record EBTA and we're seeing an acceleration of tonnage where we flipped what we should image of volume where we flipped to positive on a year on year basis in September and we expect to be positive on volume in the fourth quarter as well. Just given this backdrop Mario how are you investing in the business have you pulled back at all. We are planning for our less than truckload business we are continuing to plan to invest more into the business over the last year we pivoted to the next phase of our LTL business we call it LTL 2.0 which is based on capitalizing on the high return on invested capital into our less than truckload business so we're opening up more terminals we're adding more trailers to our fleets we're adding more trucks and we're seeing the success of doing so again we accelerated our tonnage trends at where we buck typical seasonality and we are also bucking industry trends in terms of gaining market share as well. In those tonnage trends is there anything that says to you that there is a spending pullback among some of the most notable consumers that you're carrying for? So today again our business is two-third industrial companies and the call of 2025 percent are e-commerce and or retail type type companies. We are seeing some customers slowing down where the consumer for example is buying less but we are also seeing some retail companies having to turn through inventory to have the right type of product in their supply chain and in that case they are shipping more product. For the industrial companies again a lot of these companies through COVID had pent up demand where now they are being able to get the product they need to fulfill open purchase orders and that's leading to more demand while others are seeing softer demand. So COVID is a very mixed environment and generally the map,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,10,2022-11-02 14:30:53
4617," The product they need to fulfill open purchase orders and that's leading to more demand while others are seeing softer demand. So, quality is a very mixed environment and generally the macro is softer than where it was a year ago or where it was earlier in the year, but using our own company specific initiatives who are being able to go out and gain market share by focusing on delivering great service for the customer and having capacity in our network to gain that business. Mario, what's happening on the trucker front these days? You know, we heard a lot about the trucker shortage that even before the pandemic, right? This was something that was pretty acute in the industry. What's the status and in the industry more broadly and then for XBO specifically? The driver shortage obviously is not new to our industry and it's something that did accelerate through the pandemic. Now things are getting easier where we are now than where we were earlier in the year just to give you an example in the third quarter. We saw an increase in applications per post the direct go up by 58% on a year on year basis. But we there as well we have a company specific initiative that I'm very proud of that helps us counter the driver shortage. We operate our own driver schools out of 130 locations. And this year we are on track to graduate more than 1700 drivers to join our rank. And it's a great career opportunity for people who join our company as dog workers and they can actually become a driver where they can make more wages and have a great career with us over the years to come. Mario, you you're following big footsteps and a big personality and Brad Jacobs. I'm convinced he's off camera there, but you know, maybe he's not. How do you what should investors know about you? Tell us a little bit about your story. You got it. So my background is in technology. I initially, you know, this is where my what education was, went to MIT for for my engineering degrees. And since then I used to be in the tech sector for a while then, but been with XBO for the last 11 years. I was Brad's third hire on the team back in 20, 2011. And we've been part of every decision we've made and I learned a ton of from Brad over over those 11 years. And I look forward now to this next chapter of being CEO and look forward to the next chapter of our company that we're very excited about moving forward. You know, in that extensive kind of work history, where do you think about some of the parallels that we've seen in previous economic downturns and how you intend to lead XBO through what is the impending or anticipated next downturn? Well, we are modeling for different scenarios for next year, depending on if the macro further softens from here or if things do get better as well. Now in our LTL business, it's again, it's a business that has a high mode associated with it, where you haven't had the big competitors go into less than truck load in 30 to 40 years. And that leads to strong pricing dynamics where obviously price is a stays positive in our industry, even in the soft market, we anticipate still having pricing power to our customers. The second area is managing variable cost is that if the macro thus often today 75% of our costs are variable based on the volume that we are moving through our network. So we would anticipate to work both the efficiency angle and using leveraging our technology as well to make sure that we are managing that variable cost to the volume we're seeing in the environment. But again, I would intend to also gain market share and we're looking at typical trends and we're looking industry trends in terms of being able to gain more market share from our customers. Well, good luck this holiday season. Good luck on your CEO journey looking forward to staying in touch. XPO CEO Mario Harret. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks so much. Coming up, MasterCard CEO is weighing in on the recession debate. We'll have our chat with him next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,11,2022-11-02 14:35:09
4618," I really, really think that Yone was the lucky winner. I can believe we did a omega KET21, no one ever Clay–downed in there, we told them that we were failing such before. Now we can work through many ways. And now we are ready to beat virus and start doing these things. We will continue to do this, Mr. Cardocio, Michael Mibak, weighing in on the outlook for consumers with recession fears, swallowing, also telling us about inflation. Take a listen. Well, you're not talking to the economic oracle, so I don't really know what is going to happen in the future. What I can tell you is through the lens of our business and we do see a good chunk of consumer spending and of business spending is that there is inflation in the numbers or prices have gone up. But we also see this as the more interesting story that I think is the consumers continue to spend. There is resilience in consumer spending. It pretty much every part of the world. There is changes though in what people spend on. We just talked about the shift to the services economy. But depending on different segments within the spectrum of consumers, there is more shift to maybe necessities, so less discretionary spend. We spend more on food versus back to travel. That is at different ends of the spectrum. That could be a trend that we're seeing. So the what? Someone changing. The absolute level. Not changing. We see that in Europe. We see it in the United States. We see it really in every part of the world. What do you think that momentum continues in the holidays? You know, again, back to predictions, how to see where it's going to go. So far, we don't see any near term changes in a consumer overall spending levels. The continuation of these shifts into experiences, vis-a-vis goods, I think that will continue. Are you confident in saying that we're just not going to have a recession? You don't see any red flags in your numbers that would give you. We constantly. Currently, based on the data that we have, which is all past, that already happened, there is no such indication. Consumer is resilience. That resilience will last. Last to, you know, we have not any indication that there's a near term recession. So we said, well, certainly we don't see it this year. But who knows? It's too early to talk about 2023. What will MasterCards role be in the future of crypto? Number one earlier, we were saying whatever choices people take in payments. So some people want to invest in crypto assets, for example. So, you know, buy by any cryptocurrency. And we want to make that as easy and more importantly, as safe as any other payment that people affect with MasterCards. So, buy a good, and it's not really living up to what it is. You can basically reverse that. You know, charge back that. That particular payment. And when it comes to crypto, same expectations and aspirations on safety, security, regulatory compliance. So we want to make it easy. And we want to make it safe. And that's how we've been engaging whole set of partnerships with crypto.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,12,2022-11-02 14:39:35
4619," Variations on safety, security, regulatory compliance. So we want to make it easy and we want to make it safe. And that's how we've been engaging whole set of partnerships with crypto exchanges. So I can buy crypto easily through my card and I can pay out from my crypto world using a MasterCard SEND solution with basically a push payment back into my card or wherever it goes. So making that very straightforward, you look at other aspects of the crypto economy. The overall question of where's regulation going, regulatory compliance and things like that. We have a whole set of services that we deploy to make the ecosystem safe. So exchanges, banks and everybody else who wants to play in the space, in the end they all have needs that are pretty common on safety security, so we fulfill those. And finally, there's a lot of talk out there on central bank digital currencies, which is yet another angle of the crypto economy where we advise and work with governments and we provide testing facilities. You want to create the digital sand dollar and the government of the Bahamas has done that and they partner with us to try it out and see how that works. So we cover the whole spectrum of the crypto economy. Really, from the simple starting point, it's an interesting technology. People have interested in that. There's problems to solve. The payment's easing is efficient as it could be everywhere in the world. I have this full interview with Michael now on the Yowel Finance homepage with a nifty 350 where Oracle I wrote off, but also worth noting as well, not in this particular clip. He said already in the buy-out pay later space and he said it pretty matter of fact, which got me wondering, well, what does that mean for a firm in Clarner if it comes like MasterCard is in here and perhaps going to get in here even more? What's that mean for a block? In an after pay who are also looking at more consumers leaning into the ability to pay in different segments for a purchase that they can make today instantly. And where does that even kind of have a bigger type of role in the broader kind of credit annexation that consumers have right now, especially going into the holiday season? Well, and even more broadly beyond buy-out pay later, a lot of the giant legacy financial firms are already fintech, so to speak. They're in a lot of those same businesses, right? Maybe they're not a small animal, maybe they're not as known by the public for doing that. Well, most of them do it, but I don't know what that means for the longer term competitive landscape. But by and large, America expressed MasterCard very good quarters, not just in the US, even overseas, too is well, pretty good. Yeah, absolutely. Guys, coming up, speaking of the holiday holiday travel season is upon us, we're going to speak with the CEO of Travago on the back of that company's earnings report. That's nice.

4620," Anytime Hev Shares of Travago are going on quite the trip today up 16% after seeing revenue in the third quarter rise 33% year over year, but warned that high interest rates and inflation will continue to impact consumer spending. Travago CEO Axel Heather joins us now. So always a pleasure to speak with you on the back of earnings here. Look, let's dive into some of the results here and some of the trends that you're seeing. If there's one catalyst that really sticks out to you from the quarter, what would you pinpoint? I mean, the quarter showed very strong demand as we expected. People want to travel and it's a basic need from our perspective and also what we've seen the pandemic and you've seen that demand was very strong. Prices were strong and that is obviously a good combination for us as we compie our prices. And bring it down for us a little bit, Axel, where you are seeing demand both geographically and in what kind of travel? Yes, so the Western markets were strongest in Asia. It's obviously very, very different market by market, but generally speaking, the recovery has not been as strong as in in Europe and in America's kind of travel. I mean, a bit all over the place, so our top destination worldwide is London, so the big metropolitan attractive cities. But then you've also seen in the US a lot of demand for Orlando, for Anaheim, so for the Disneyland trips, family trips, beaches were very popular. So really, I would say, you have very, very broad demand and all the trips that you couldn't do during the pandemic. People wanted to do now. Axel, Brian Chesky, over at Airbnb, talked a lot about on his earnings call last night, a little bit of a slowdown in the holiday quarter. You seeing that? No, I mean, the third quarter was very strong for us. I mean, what we are seeing right now that there are first signs of a change in consumer behavior, which is exactly what you would expect. I mean, the inflation is hitting consumers pretty much everywhere in the Western world. And what we expect for next year, and we see early signs of that, are basically three things. One is that people are reducing their length of stay, so trying to save some money by by staying for one day less. And there we see some early signs in Europe in particular. You do expect people to actually go to different destinations where either transportation is cheaper or the destination overall is cheaper. And again, we start to see that, in particular, in Europe, for example, Morocco is becoming more popular, which is a very attractive destination, but usually not on top of everybody's list. And the last thing is that you expect people to obviously compare prices more if things are getting more expensive. And that's exactly what we do. And we also see they are an increase in activity. One of the types of stays that you're seeing people lean into, especially as they are comparing prices. And where potentially are they beginning to push back on some of those prices? Yeah, I mean, the types of trips, the top destinations are actually still very similar, as I said, I mean, London worldwide in the US, New York is actually on top of the list. And we do see that people start...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,14,2022-11-02 14:48:12
4621," Okay, it's actually on top of the list. But we do see that people start to move away from the top and most expensive destinations to more secondary destinations to still have a good break and then to take some time off without sacrificing on the experience but saving some money. Axel, we're trying to just tie a lot of pieces or pieces of economic puzzle together. So we had SDL order our earnings this morning noting a slowdown in travel retail and specifically called out Asia. What are you seeing in your business in terms of international travels to the US and then also in Asia specifically? Yeah, Asia is very difficult to comment on because the situation in Asia is very different market by market. I mean, generally speaking, we see some recovery but very different. Japan, for example, we've seen a strong and strong increase in Q3, but it's difficult to comment in general. Overall, the US is obviously in a specific situation given the strength of the dollar. So traveling from the US to Europe in particular got a lot cheaper. So we see a lot more demand from US travelers for the top and most attractive European cities like London, Paris, Rome, etc. The other way round, obviously got a lot more expensive and you can also see that. We've had some CEOs classify this as the golden age of travel that coming from the Hilton CEO. While we heard from Airbnb last night that for cross-border travel, the return would be choppy moving forward from here. From your purview, is it more choppy than it is? Kind of golden at this point in time, especially looking across some of the international destinations that you were just mentioning a moment ago? I mean, it's difficult to say to be honest. I think my view is somewhere in the middle. It's, I do think that people will continue to travel and I do think that the spending for traveling next year will be up from this year. On the other hand, I also do expect travelers to cut back on the nights that they stay in hotels to save some money and to compensate for the inflation that you have on travel costs. So you're not a bad market. I mean, the market will be up next year, but not a golden market either. Not a bad move in the stock price here today in reaction to earnings here. We've seen them moving higher and holding on to some sharp games as the rest of the market is waiting for the Fed. We're appreciative of the time, as always, Travago, CEO, Axel Heifer, Axel, thanks so much. Guys, coming up, we're gonna do a deep dive into some more earnings reports. We've got young brands, Canada Goose, and Tupperware brands, Royce, coming up next. Stop. V",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,15,2022-11-02 14:52:58
4622,"ünf It is time for Cut for Time. You hear the song, you know it. Today we focus on three earnings, one minute each. Let's put a minute on the clock for shares of young brands following the third quarter earnings report that saw the company miss on profits but beat on revenue estimates as same-store sales increased 5% worldwide. We did see a net change lower to the downside and operating income there and significantly so you're over a decline of about 62.7%. My answer is I really want to lock in on this talk about results. Same-store sales up 6% recessions are made for talk about but I have to call out pizza hood. Same-store sales 1%. This just continues to be a persistent problem for this company. They need to fix it unclear what the solution would be to get those sales back up a pizza but they have a key investor day in December so they perhaps may share it a little more of a stretch. KFC was the big outperformer here. I'm 7% comps. I will say pizza hot while it was only up 1% beat estimates and Taco Bell missed estimates even though it was up 6%. Oh, big question. Correct myself. In all of the different tabs I have open I was actually looking at the long-run earnings report. They're operating profit, gap basis grew 4% and then the core operating profit of 80% there. So I was giving actually a deep tease to our next company. Can I get a goose? All right. So I have a goose while they're down I'm told after the cold weather apparel posted an earnings beat for the second quarter but slashed Q3 in full your guidance as they expect COVID-19 restriction in China to continue negatively impacting performance. Not a bad quarter for Katna Goose just going through it I think really took me back to when I talked to Daniel Rees over at the Goldman conference a couple of weeks ago. The man seems to be good. China appears to be the weak point though. Also inventory no big builds there. Not a hugely big red flag but I mean it's quite a lot. I don't know this is not what you want to hear from the CFO. Jonathan Sinclair telling analysts it is extremely challenging to project the bulk of the years trading based on merely a few weeks of visibility but recent events impacting trends are not supportive of our original outlook. Not supportive of our original outlook that's not what you want to hear. I mean far less people are going to have the money at least to spend and because Canada Goose had been trying to get more into kind of the average consumer even though it's a very pricey product. The affluent consumer continues to kind of attract towards that but there are new kind of trendier fashion jackets, coats, outerwear that is taking on more of that market share that Canada Goose once held on to strongly. However I will say I've never been so confident turning a corner in New York City during a winter. I love my country. I love my country. I love my country. How confident are you when you put your food, your leftovers in a container? Oh, it's a good one. It's a good one. No, that was a bad trend. Wow. Share some tap-aware brands are plunging. They are off by 43% today. Big earnings miss for TUP on both the top and bottom lines. The company reporting a 20% drop in sales compared with last year here and just getting destroyed in terms of the shares here. It's pretty amazing. The company says it's going to take additional restructuring actions in the fourth quarter as well as implementing stringent inventory reduction programs. Yeah, I bet. Yeah. Look, we just heard a couple of weeks ago we got a warning from New L brands too as well. So perhaps this shouldn't have come as a shocker. Really, I would say shame on TUP-worthy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,16,2022-11-02 14:56:56
4623," I bet. Yeah, and look, we just heard a couple weeks ago, we got a warning from New L brands too as well, so perhaps this shouldn't have come as a shocker. But really, I would say shame on Tupperware. They came out a couple weeks ago and really I think hyped up this new development where they're going to sell products outside of their Tupperware infrastructure into Target and the stock reacted favorably. But now they're coming out here a couple weeks later and really just reporting a really, really ugly quarter. Right, and that's the expansion of the Tupperware ecosystem that they were talking about in this earnings release. But the company is going to continue to really kind of move forward with this turnaround plan, but the investors are upset that the turnaround plan is not paying dividends as quickly as they would have hoped. My mom used to sell Tupperware. I know she's watching. I remember you sold Tupperware mom. I mean, how much plastic crap do we have in her houses? Like how much more do you need? So, I don't know. She hasn't sold any more just to be clear. She hasn't sold Tupperware. I've also ordered, okay. I don't know. No, I didn't think I was insulting your brother. I hoped I wasn't insulting your brother. I've also ordered enough from caviar and door dash at this point that I just kind of keep the containers. You keep the containers? Of course, you don't need to buy anything. Let's take a look at markets before we leave you here as we are still waiting for the Fed. Can't forget about that.

4624," It's just three hours away. Expectations are for a 75 basis point hike. Investors are going to be parsing and dissecting every line and that it would be from Chairman Jay Powell's presser. All the divine clues as to the future of U.S. monetary policy. And it is an earnings parade on Wall Street as investors digesting earnings from Estee Lauder, Young Brands, Paramount, and Airbnb. We're going to break down the numbers and stop movements for you. And finally, luxury profits. The CEO of Bentley Motors tells us what drove profits to record highs this year. Prosubermanian joins us for the interview. But first, we want to take a look at where stocks are trading right now. It's a down day on Wall Street. Dow is down about 83 basis points. The S&P 500 of the Nasdaq, each off about half a percent. And taking a look at the bond market, the yield curve has shifted lower. And this is all on the heels of that big Fed decision that we are expecting later today. And for that, we want to stick with this and bring in Yahoo Finance as Jennifer Schonberger, who's standing on the scene over at the Fed in DC. Can't wait. What is on deck today, Jennifer? Good morning, Jared. Fed officials meeting right now in this building behind me discussing the economy, discussing inflation. They are widely expected to raise short term rates by another three quarters of a percentage point when they conclude their policy meeting this afternoon at 2 p.m. That would bring the Fed funds rate up to a range of 3.75% to 4% up from the current range of 3 to 3.75% to 3.75%. That would mark the fourth straight 75 basis point rate hike since June. An unprecedented move by the Federal Reserve since it started explicitly targeting the Fed funds rate back in the late 1980s. But it will be what Fed Chair Pell says during his press conference on the pace of forthcoming rate hikes that markets will be most attuned to. Investors expect that the Fed will signal that it will slow down the pace of forthcoming rate hikes starting in its December meeting. A few Fed officials have talked about the notion of stepping down the pace of rate hikes. The Fed wants to tame inflation while also towing the line between not crashing the economy and taking into account that monetary policy filters through the economy with a lag. So while the Fed may taper the pace and open question remains how much higher they could raise race and whether they stick with their current forecast. If inflation remains sticky, right now the Fed expects to raise to 4.6% on average next year. Of course, all of this contingent on forthcoming data, specifically inflation, we will get more from Fed Chair Pell during his press conference at 2.30 this afternoon. Jared. And Jennifer, that's what I want to focus on because all the traders, both humans and artificial intelligence high frequency trading algorithms, going to focus on Powell's tone there and how that's conveyed. Because we know with Jackson Hole, he was very short-brief saying, we're going to hike until this breaks or something along those lines. And then it seems like some dovish expectations have creeped back into the market with some talk about standing down. So what are traders expecting here? Yeah, Jared. I think that Chair Powell is going to have to toe the line as I just mentioned. He's still going to have to talk tough on inflation because it is still sticky. If you look at the core inflation rates, whether it's CPI or PCE, the Fed's preferred measure. But he's going to have to talk tough on inflation while also saying that they're going to take into account that they're not going to crash this economy. Now he has said that pain is going to be involved here. So maybe the question is, do they accept a shallow recession? And is that why they may be signaling that it's time to start soon stepping down the pace of rate hikes? In other words, you step down the pace. You ease the pressure on the economy. But maybe that also means the Fed funds rate has to go higher eventually if inflation remains sticky. Yeah, we're going to sort it all out in a few hours. And we know you're going to be standing by for that. Thank you, Vialcul Finance. This is Jennifer Seanberger. And now we're going to take a look at the broader markets and investors as we await the Fed's rate decision. And for that, we have Portia Capital Management owner, Michelle Connell here. And Michelle, great to see you here today. Let me just get your overview of what you're expecting in terms of fireworks or maybe no fireworks in a few hours. Jared, I'm probably in the same cap as everyone else. And I'm going to reiterate what general.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,18,2022-11-02 15:05:36
4625," in terms of fireworks or maybe no fireworks in a few hours. Jared, I'm probably in the same cap as everyone else and I'm gonna reiterate what Jennifer just said. I think the Fed comes out with a 75 point rate hike and the remain conservative going forward and they keep a stern tone towards inflation. But that being said, we're seeing some areas of weakness in some pricing, shipping, imports that are used by consumers and producers. So I think maybe soon versus later, they'll kind of slow down the pace of increases. Well, and then let me ask for your market reaction here. We have seasonality, the best six months of the year, historically speaking, are among, is upon us here, starting with November, the end of October there. That is well understood in the markets, but more than that, there are a lot of videos and credit factors going on. What sectors in terms of equities do you like? What broad movements would you expect in terms of risk metrics going forward? Well, I think because we're at the midterm election cycle and I'm gonna couple that with what you just said about where we are in the cycle. In a midterm election afterwards, between November, the end of November and April, you typically see an upswing in the market or an increase of about 14%. That being said, maybe that doesn't happen. But what gives me some solace here is that even though the last month was pretty strong for the S&P and for the Russell, we still have 50% of the publicly traded stocks that are down 50% year to date. So this is becoming a stock picker's market. Well, and let me ask you about some of the sectors you may like, tech really has taken it on the nose. I mean, most things besides energy are down considerably, but especially tech, anything in there or any other sectors you're liking right now. I still like the chip sector. I started off as a semi conductor analyst back in the day was a little bit early on that, but you're still seeing strong demand for an Nvidia and I think AMD posted strong earnings. I like the data centers and storage and I also think Tesla has a chance in going back to the storage area. I think snowflake looks interesting. All three stocks that I named are down 50% year to date, but I'm not just looking at technology. There's still some good names in energy, even though energy's been the best performing sector. Shell looks really interesting. They had great earnings. They're trading at a deep discount versus their peers about 50% strong dividend. I like some of the industrials. Dear, I look at that kind of as a technology innovation play because they're so strong on their software and being able to maximize the acreage that are used and that also plays a strong dividend. So it's not just one sector, but it's finding those pockets at each sector that still look attractive, you know, in terms of their pricing and potentially their income potential. All right, we're gonna have to leave it there. We're gonna find out a bunch more on this topic in a few hours in the meantime. Thank you, Michelle Connell, Porsche Capital Management owner. And now time for, thank you. And now time for our trending ticker of the day. Canada Goose, providing warmth, has winter descends on the Northern Hemisphere and sending the stock a tad lower today. You can see down about 5%, but rebounding off the lows of the year. And that says the Coatmaker beat on revenue, raking in $277 million Canadian dollars in the second quarter. It also beat on expectations on non-IFRS-adjusted earnings for share of $0.22 Canadian cents versus estimates of only six cents. But focus on COVID disruptions in China's luxury market. They are obscuring the outlook for global macroeconomics and they led the company to lower its fiscal 2023 outlook. On this no Bloomberg intelligence is opining that the slow China reopening is already dragging early on in quarter three. Coming up, shares of meta and SNAP have been pummeled this year. Twitter now in the hands of Elon Musk, and it begs the question, is social media as we know it? Is it over? We're going to discuss next.

4626," The media as we know it is it over. We're going to discuss next. Welcome back and let's take a look at some key earnings from beauty and food and entertainment. Companies, many of these brands, seeing a shift in their earnings due to international headwinds now from lockdowns in China to Russia's war in Ukraine. Joining us now is Yahoo! What are the details in this latest earnings spree? Well Jared, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve today but we are still in the throes of earnings season with a lot of headliners this morning. One of them is SD louder, shares were down about 6% at last glance after the company indicated that it wouldn't see a return to growth until 2023. SD louder, slashed, it's full year forecast, blaming lockdowns in China and also saying that some retailers are taking its cosmetics and perfumes off of their shelves amid worries of an economic slowdown. Notable also that this announcement comes ahead of a crucial earnings, a crucial holiday season for them. The company now expects net sales for 2023 to decrease to 6% to 8% compared to its prior forecast of growth of 3 to 5%. And like its peers in the consumer discretionary sector such as Nike and Levi's, it's also citing currency headwinds as a stronger dollar eats into its international profits. Now makeup demand might be slowing down but people are still lining up to KFC and Taco Bell, young brands, missed estimates on earnings per share, also citing currency headwinds and a loss in profits from its KFC exit from Russia. But it did report rising sales across its fast food chains, even as fast food restaurants are raising prices to keep up with rising commodity and labor costs, people are still flocking to them, opting for more value oriented options.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,20,2022-11-02 15:14:17
4627," Fast food restaurants are raising prices to keep up with rising commodity and labor costs. People are still flocking to them, opting for more value-oriented options. We saw that with McDonald's last week as they shy away from more expensive, dine-out options amid inflation. And finally, Paramount Global is also a mover today. Shares were down as much as 10 percent this morning after the company missed Wall Street estimates on 3rd quarter earnings, Paramount's profit hit was the result of larger investments in content to boost its business. While weakness in advertising revenue also weighed on the quarter, the company did cite growth in its global streaming services, but that wasn't enough to a P's Wall Street. Interesting, makes the company's there and I've got to tell you I can testify to those higher makeup prices, but I still got to be a buyer. So thank you for that report, Alex Submanova. All right, moving on to Elon Musk, making big changes at Twitter saying the service will begin charging for the blue check marks indicated as users are verified. But as social media companies overall grapple with changing demographics, can stalwarts like Twitter and Meta keep up? And here with more is Yahoo Fanat's Dan Howley. So the latest in this saga, Twitter plus, can we think of it that way? Yeah, I mean, look, so my basic takeaway from everything that's happening with social media right now is that this is kind of a changing of the guard where we had seen for so long Facebook and Twitter be the mainstays, the stalwarts. But now this is kind of changing over to what we have with TikTok, what we have with up and comers like Be Real and the reason being is it doesn't seem like Meta really cares about social media anymore. At least as far as Mark Zuckerberg is concerned, now investors certainly still care. They want him to stop with the Metaverse, but he continues to dump $10 billion a year into the effort. And then so far this year, we have a little less than $10 billion to this point. And then they said that in 2023, they're going to see spending on it increase a huge amount. So this is something that they're going to continue to focus on as the future of the company. Twitter, we don't know what's going on. You know, Elon Musk has had the lead with Stephen King to talk about what they should charge for the checkmarks to be verified. So there's still so much up in the air. And it feels like this is a moment where social media is going from what it was to what it will be. And these new companies TikTok AI driven AI powered feed that gets people addicted and look, I deleted it again. Just because you sit there and you're scrolling and scrolling and scroll, then you have Be Real, which is really trying to make social media feel less manufactured, though, any time a pop-up comes that says, be real, you know, and tells you when to start posting. A lot of people still, you know, stage what they were doing or try to make it look a little bit better. Nobody wants pictures of people sitting in the bathroom, which is most of the time on social media. And I think, you know, the other issue that we're seeing is that kids don't care about the main Facebook app. While that still has billions of users, we have a few poll earlier this year said just 32% of teens say that they use Facebook. Meanwhile, we have something like 70% say they use TikTok, 70% plus. So there's these huge swings. And, you know, obviously we could talk about meta performance so far, year-to-date, the shares are down 72%. So what I want to ask you, it's related to meta and the turn, but not turn around strategy. I guess it could be considered a turn around strategy. If you're looking at the stock there on your screen down 72%. Year-to-date. What if Mark is right? What if Zuckerberg is right? This is what I asked myself late at night, not always, but sometimes, you know, in terms of the metaverse, he's pulling $10 billion a year into this project that a lot of people, including a lot of people who work for him, who voted for their feet, don't believe in. Could this be the future of social media? It's interesting, right? Because so many companies are putting money into the metaverse, right? In one way or the other. Now, in my thinking, a company like Nvidia is doing it really well where they're making these ideas of digital twins and they're trying to make it so that when companies build out factories or try to build out infrastructure, they have a kind of virtual version of the world that they can go and manipulate. And so they're not going to spend as much time trying to build out these different kinds of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,21,2022-11-02 15:18:34
4628," infrastructure, they have a kind of virtual version of the world that they can go and manipulate. And so they're not going to spend as much time trying to build out these different kinds of infrastructure, right? So that, I think, is the smarter take. This is, for Meta so far, banking on people, strapping headsets to their face. I don't see people doing that. And the numbers don't bear out. The Wall Street Journal did a piece where they said that Meta had wanted at least 500,000 people in their Horizon World's app by the end of this year. And so far, they had to revise that number to 280,000 because only 200,000 are in there. So it's not like people are clamoring to get on board. They also just launched their new headset. It's what, $1,500 or something along those lines. People can't buy it. It's not something that I think is going to take off in that sense. Now, there's different definitions of the Metaverse. It's not just walking around with goofy, real goggles. There's also the idea that, well, I'm on my computer and I'm interacting with something. So maybe that's the Metaverse. And there's all sorts of discussions of that. Maybe heads up display on your car. That's the Metaverse. So I think that there is still room for it. I don't know though if it's going to be the next social media splash. I think something like TikTok, something along those lines will continue to do well. I just don't think people want to strap something to their face. I don't. Yeah, it's going to have to be some kind of improvement in technology. Maybe that we can't even comprehend yet. But the infrastructure, as we talk about, much like crypto being built right now, and I need to find different things to worry about late at night. Thank you for joining us here with that report, Dan Holley. Coming up, Airbnb shares falling, despite reporting its quote, biggest and most profitable quarter ever. We're going to tell you why next. Welcome back in some breaking news and sports, the Washington Commander.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,22,2022-11-02 15:23:05
4629," Welcome back in some breaking news in sports. The Washington commanders owners, Dan and Tynas Niter announcing that they have hired Bank of America's securities to consider potential transactions. This comes as Dan himself has faced increased pressure to sell the team statement from the commanders said they remain committed to putting the best product in field and continuing the work that to set the gold standard for workplaces in the NFL. We're going to continue to monitor this and bring you developments as they come in. And now luxury British carmaker Bentley announcing record operating profits for the first nine months of 2022. Part of the reason increased customization, Yahoo Finance, Autos reporter, senior auto correspondent, Prada Supermanian is here to tell us all about this. Now we know Bentley's are made by hand at least they used to in terms of my knowledge of it. Still they got that level of attention in detail? Yes, still they've sort of industrialized that process here. So you know strong years so far for Bentley and not surprising from what we're seeing from luxury brands. So the first three quarters of the year, Bentley's operating profit more than double like he said you're out to record high compared to last year but get this. They've only sold three percent more cars. So Bentley Motor CEO Adrian Hallmark says it's all about customers paying up for more goodies. I've been in this industry and in this sector for nearly 28 years. I've never seen spending patterns like it and not just in Bentley, I mean generally. I use an analogy with the way in earlier. If you walk down the line of our production facility even three, four years ago, you'd see line upon line of gray, black, dark blue, dark green cars and the occasional red one. And it was like a dark, somber, conservative place. If you walk through now, it's like a circus. The color, the diversity of what people are ordering, exterior and interior is just fundamentally changed. So there's more customers out there and they're way more interested now in self expression and in personalization. And the second thing is what we've done with the product range. So the product range is the strongest it's ever been and it's good compared with competition. But then also we have consciously, as we say, industrialized complexity. Rather than bringing the number of variables down, we've looked at and said, right, we know if we can do more for customers, they invest more in the product and we make more money. Hallmark says they don't make more money from more horsepower out of more stitching, more leather and more wood. I asked Hallmark what the luxury buy and why they seem so insatiable right now. And he said part of it is because the company's research finds that the number of high network individuals has been growing over the past 20 years to the point that there's four times as many compared to 20 years ago. Ice inflation prize, I guess there's a little bit more to it than that. But let me ask you about their EV plans. We've seen all the big manufacturers take the leap and sometimes with great results, sometimes something else. What's the Bentley case? So, Bentley, just like everyone else, they want to go full EV by 2030. They're going to, that's their goal for right now. Their first EV comes out in 2025 and asks them about that. How's that going to compare to the Rolls Royce Spectre which we saw come out a few weeks back. There's a fascinating car, they like it, but they say ours is going to be more of a grand touring car, a daily driver because they find most of their buyers actually drive their cars every day. So, they want more range, things like that. But also, how much services they want, the charging kind of experience to be a luxury sort of experience. So, they're going to have their own sort of, probably bespoke network of chargers who knows or working through other existing companies. But my understanding is that they want it to be a concierge, it wants a luxury type of service. So, you just mentioned charging and I know that there's no agreed on universal standard right now. How is that evolving in the U.S. especially as all these goals have been brought to the forefront? 2030, 3540? What does the infrastructure look like in terms of EV charging stations? I think as of right now, I think everyone agreed that there's just too few chargers out there in the public space. So, we're seeing a lot more investment from the government here, right? That's $7.5 billion meant to build out, and not only a super highway of charge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,23,2022-11-02 15:27:12
4630," out there in the public space, right? So we're seeing a lot more investment from the government here, right? That's $7.5 billion meant to build out and not only a super highway of chargers, but also just in local areas whether you don't have that many, maybe some suburban or rural areas. So we're seeing that happen. I think the big prom Jared is with the public companies, like the charge points of the world, the EV goes, is so expensive to build these chargers. And there's still not enough, I guess, critical mass of the users, just quite yet. And we will get there someday though. In the meantime, thank you for that report. Praz Supermanian. And taking a look at Airbnb shares trading down about 10% having the worst day since May, that's after posting them better than expected, third quarter earnings, however, the disappointing guidance is causing shares to sell off today. And joining me now is Bernie McTiernan, managing director at Needham and company. I was taking a look, I was breaking the numbers last night and saw that Ford guidance. Should the stock be down more? I even think this reaction is overdoing it to be honest. We're still seeing strong demand trends. Nights both tore up 25% and in the third quarter, we have that decelerating slightly in the fourth quarter of itself a healthy 23 and a half percent. And then ADRs, that's the big question. That's the big focus of the bears right now. They're up 12% year over year in a constant currency basis. We have that decelerating to 7% growth in 4Q. And then on the expectation that we're going to be past peak travel in 23, we actually have them declining 4% next year. But that's really the debate here is that when the macro was going to force Airbnb kind of off the edge of the cliff of this peak travel and ADRs and then the implication of margins is the key focus for the bears. And let me ask you about the Nights and Experiences. That number, especially the forecast, disappointed how critical is Nights and Experiences to the Airbnb model right now? Well, it's the whole flywheel. And so the more people that are booking the more demand that's in the system, that's going to drive ADRs higher. That pricing lever is what flows through the higher margins. And what's really interesting is that it's really a tale of two companies where before the pandemic, things like cross-border travel and urban, where they're really the major use cases for Airbnb. And those are growing really strongly. Urban was up 48% cross-border travel. It was up 27% during the quarter. But there's also these new use cases now that are forming whether it's more rural stays, whether it's long-term stays, long-term stays are still 20% of the bookings on the platform. So proving that it wasn't just a pandemic phenomenon and people really are changing. And going on that point in terms of travel is changing. If you rewind the clock a week or two ago when United Airlines reported earnings, their CEO was channeling his Brian, his inner Brian Chesky and talking about how they thought every weekend now is a three-day weekend and just the potential for them. So not only are they benefiting from business travel coming back with how consumer travel is changing. And Airbnb is certainly benefiting from those trends and consumer travel that Brian's been talking about really since the start of the pandemic. And let me talk to you about Brian. Now, you can talk to us, Bernie, because I remember we were interviewing Brian Chesky early on in the pandemic. They made a huge, huge pivot, which was a correct bet at the time. And I was impressed by the speed at which they pivoted. Some people wish the Fed could be as quick about these things, but I'm just wondering, are things changing now? Is there going to be another switch that Airbnb may able to take hold of and maybe leave its competitors behind a bit? Yeah, it's a good question. So when we, so supply, for example, supply on the platform accelerated this past quarter from mid to high single digit growth and second quarter up to 15% in the third quarter. Our channel check show that verbo supply actually declined in October. So I think that part of the reason is like they want you to be listing on Airbnb. They've been doing trying to innovate a lot on things like air cover, which is a reason why hosted want to be with Airbnb, but also maybe why guests want to be Airbnb too. And that's the power of the platform. When we talk about this marketplace with 30% plus EBITDA margins, the reason why they're able to generate such a EBITDA margins, because they don't need pay for traffic. And still 90%",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,24,2022-11-02 15:31:37
4631," or the platform, when we talk about this marketplace with 30% plus EBITDA margins, the reason why they're able to generate a try EBITDA margins, because they don't need pay for traffic. And still 90% of their traffic is coming to their platform organically. And they're letting that flow through to the bottom line free cash level conversion from revenue over the last 12 months is 41%. They bought back a billion dollars of shares. They have over nine billion dollars of cash. So the investments that they made during the pandemic are really pivots that they may, especially on the cost structure. And that they haven't changed that cost structure that were in a peak travel environment should enable them to weather, you know, a downturn. Obviously, you know, I think bears are playing for that ADR moderation that I spoke about, you know, being minus 4% next year that we have in our malls, they probably have more than that. But the company was confident that they should be able to weather any ADR deterioration, at least modern ADR deterioration from a from a margin standpoint. And that just, and they have the financial flexibility certainly to weather that kind of storm. Well, we have to leave it there at nine billion dollars in cash and enviable position for a number of companies. Thank you, Bernie. Make turn in of need them and company coming up.

And joining me now is a company CEO and co-founder, Bryce Jones, along with Yahoo Finance, is Brook, De Palma, as well. Now, Bryce, we are talking about your business model during the break. Just give us an overview of what you're bringing to the market here. Oh, well, thank you for having me. We're bringing in the market, a work-by-day play-by-night concept. And we're open from 8 AM to 3 AM at any given venue, serving coffee to cocktails all hours of the day. And now, essentially, you have a location freehold Brooklyn, you have freehold Miami. You rent all your locations. And according to a new survey from Alina Bull, they said about 37% of small businesses across the US were actually unable to rent in full in October. So how are you facing the inflation that's hitting rental prices? And when you look at expansion plans, how is that impacting that as well? I mean, for us, you always have to adapt to whatever it is, whether it be rising costs of goods sold, payroll costs, or just the ability to find staff. And recent rent hikes, you just have to find a way. And we do that through volume, specifically, when everybody else might be cutting. We're trying to invest more into programming and events, whether it be the DJ or the barista walking through your coffee in the morning and so forth. I got to ask you about Miami. I am a native, spent a considerable time there growing up. I'm just wondering, I haven't been down there since the pandemic. I know this scene has changed tremendously. I'm just wondering what it looks like in terms of operating your business down there. I mean, it's bustling. The tourism's very, very high right now. For us, we definitely chose that market as we thought it was pretty much the best growth market in the states right now. It's held completely through the rising cost of inflation and so forth as well. And also in Miami, you have cryptocurrency available to pay if your customers, what sort of interaction have you seen with that? Is it successful there? Are you looking to bring it in Brooklyn as well? I like to compare it to years ago, you have a customer come in with an American Express Black card. And for us, you don't see that card all the time. And it's similar to crypto. You don't see it all the time, but it's special when it happens. It's happening more and more frequently in Miami specifically. And I'm sure the bartenders are always excited to accept it. I know the bartenders always love to see those black cars whipped out here in New York. So I was also asking you over the break, you have private clubs such as Seoul House. You're at a different genre here. You also have that lived work situation. And you are open to the public, whereas that is a private club. So how does that difference in business model work for you? I think volume, so House is a curated group that is very specific to the entertainment industry. And for us, we're trying to appeal to a variety of different demographics, whether it be the tech community, whether it be music and entertainment, and fashion. And for us, that element really brings a very diverse group that packs the place every night. I didn't hear finance in there. No finance, bros. We love finance. OK, then. Just to go back to inflation here, we've seen higher prices across the board. Certainly, when customers are going to get groceries in the store, but also seeing less of an increase at food away from home, have you taken any higher menu prices? And also, how is that sort of taking a toll on your customers? I think our industry is a bit tougher to raise prices. If we raise the price of a latte to what it should be, which would be about $7 of be outcry, for us, we really try to invest in the volume and try to bring. When everybody else is making it smaller or raising prices, we try to actually expand our programming and our events. Well, let me ask you continuing along the discussion of prices, labor, a huge input cost. I know I've talked to several people in the hospitality field, and the turnover is a killer. It's been a challenge for a lot of business owners to retain, and it just get people in the door to work the service bars and the floor and whatever. How are you dealing with these labor challenges? I mean, to give you an example, New York raised minimum wage four times in four years. So labor has always been an issue for our industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,28,2022-11-02 15:49:05
4635," the floor and whatever, how are you dealing with these labor challenges? I mean, to give you an example, New York raised minimum wage four times in four years. So labor has always been an issue for our industry specifically in New York. And for us, the new market is getting people into the door. But I got to tell you that's actually been almost a benefit of inflation in some ways. That people actually need their jobs, they want their jobs, they're here to work, and they're excited to come to work and learn more about the business every day. And we haven't really seen that for the last few years. And it's been sort of a recovery effort by all New York City hospitalities. Really get back after the pandemic. You sit on the board of the New York Hospitality Alliance here. What exactly are you hearing from fellow restaurant owners, fellow small business owners as well, these boutique hotels? Would you say that we have fully recovered from the pandemic? I think we had an amazing 2021. I think we are cautiously optimistic about 2022 and beyond. I think the industry is going in a very positive place despite rising costs. And I think as far as turnout and guest appreciation, we're seeing a ton of success there. And finally to round out the discussion, expansion plans, you're going internationally and Tarksica, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, expansion plans. We're very much eager and willing and looking into it. We have our eyes on a couple of things, but I can't really see anything at this time. All right, sounds- We continue to- Freehold Hospitality CEO and co-founder Bryce Jones and Yahoo Finance's Brooke DuPolma. Coming up even with mortgage rates above 7% it still may make sense for some homeowners to refinance. We're going to tell you who those people are next. Welcome back with mortgage rates at their highest levels in 20 years. Does it make sense for homeowners to refinance? Now some experts think it might and joining me now to discuss Yahoo Finance's Danny Romero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,29,2022-11-02 15:53:36
4636," Back with mortgage rates at their highest levels in 20 years. Does it make sense for homeowners to refinance? Now some experts think it might and joining me now to discuss is Yahoo! Finances, Danny Romero, and Danny, when I saw this, I was thinking, wow, that the math may not work out for most people, but maybe some here. Yeah, so there are a few reasons why someone would benefit from refinancing the first. Is someone who's struggling with their finances. So people who want to consolidate their debt by using their mortgage rate as a way to overall lower their overall debt costs. Secondly, would be someone who's seeking cash, who wants to use the cash out refinance option, meaning which it allows them to access equity that they've built on their home. And lastly, someone who would benefit from refinancing is someone who's dealing with the end of their fixed rate term on their adjustable rate mortgage. So that means that if they locked in at that 7.8, 7.08 percent mortgage rate, that means that their monthly payments later on in the future they won't increase. So those are a few reasons why someone would benefit from refinancing, especially under this current environment. And Black Knight came out with data that says that there are about 133,000 homeowners that are eligible to lower their monthly payments by $325. By lowering their rate to 7.08 percent and that population of homeowners got their mortgage in 2008 or before. Now, having said all that, I want to talk about the lending side. Volumes are down. We know that prices are sticky. People might be bulking and saying, oh, I can't afford that house. What's happening with the lending side right now? Yeah, Jared, you said it left and right. We've heard from different mortgage companies that they are scaling back. They're also laying off their employees due to the lack in demand for mortgages. I mean, data shows us that applications for mortgages is down 86 percent this year. But compared to last year, excuse me, also revenue is down for a lot of these mortgage companies as higher interest rates become really costly for them. And there's even been some lenders who deal with riskier loans that have said, sayonara, I'm no longer going to operate any more. So yes, it is a really grim picture for the lending side. But I spoke with a loan manager who says she's very optimistic, even though they are facing these, these headwinds especially. But she said that she's really betting that interest rates mortgage rates will turn around. Danny, we got another minute or two here. You talk to a lot of people. You got boots on the ground. You go around interviewing people, talk to small business owners. What are they saying? What does it have to be with respect necessarily lending? It can be about particularly peculiarities of their business. But what's the tone on the street in terms of some of the business owners that you're talking to? Some of them that I've just spoken to, inflation. I mean, that word gets thrown around. It's something that they're constantly dealing with. Also employment. I mean, we just saw those numbers just yesterday from the Joltz, I mean, reports. So we're really seeing that they are dealing with a lot of these macro economic topics that we talk about on a daily, right? But I mean, really, we have a big decision coming up. We were just talking about that earlier about the Fed. Two hours and counting. You're counting it. I mean, a lot of people are counting it. And I think we have to really showcase that this trickles down to anybody. We will feel the impacts. Small business owners will feel the impacts. Home buying homeowners. They will also be feeling the impacts on whatever the decision may be in the next two hours or so. Yes. Yes. And two hours and a half hours to the fireworks. That would be the Powell Pressor. Keep it tuned. All right. Thank you for that, Danny Romero. All right. Now with a little bit of time left, we do want to take a final check with the markets on the Wi-Fi interactive. And we see the Dow down about eight basis points today. S&P 500 down to 44 NASDAQ down just under 1%. You can see nesting, nessling there by the lows of the day. All eyes turning to the Fed in a couple hours here. We're going to get that big announcement that we're going to bring to you live at 2 p.m. And then at 2.30 p.m. as I was just mentioning, we got that Powell Pressor. Now what you're looking at now, that is a NASDAQ 100. And we can see Apple down 1%. So is Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla almost down 2%?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,30,2022-11-02 15:57:42
4637," that power pressure. Now what you're looking at now, that is a NASDAQ 100 and we can see Apple down 1% so is Microsoft Alphabet. Tesla almost down 2% Amazon down a little bit more and let's take a look at the chip sector. We got some positive earnings and news from AMD that stock on the upper right that is up over 2% so is what applied materials and Nvidia. Now taking a look at the sector leaders, only utilities and industrials are up about a quarter percent each. For the downside it's still those mega caps that are lagging now consumer discretionary tech communication services are the leaders but we're going to see some more movement in a couple hours so stay tuned for now. I'm Jared Glickry. Thank you for watching. For the holiday shopping season, our next guest though expects sales to be weighed down by heightened inflationary pressures as non-disgressionary prices continue to rise. Bank of America retail analysts Lorraine Hutchinson joined us now. Hi Lorraine, thanks so much for being here. I mean we all know the pressures that are out there right from rising prices for things you need so you have less to spend on things that you want. So talk to us about the holiday season and how all of this plays out. Do you expect people to be buying fewer things or less expensive things or all of the above? Thanks good morning. Our holiday forecast calls for just over 1% sales growth. We do expect people to be using their money more frugally given the pressures they're facing on the non-disgressionary parts of their budget. What we're also expecting is on the discretionary side, a lot of their money's been used this year on vacations, eating out. Things we couldn't necessarily do a lot of last year. So it makes for a little bit of a tougher holiday for the consumer. We would expect them to be much more focused on value and much more focused on looking for deals this holiday season. Does that signal that household balance sheets are not healthy as some banks have told us this earnings season? Look, our, you know, our view.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,31,2022-11-02 16:02:17
4638," and much more focused on looking for deals this holiday season. Does that signal that household balance sheets are not healthy as some banks have told us this early season? Look, our, you know, our BAC card data and the work of our institute says that the balance sheets still are healthy. It's just a little, we've seen a little bit of pullback in spending in September. And we think that that bodes poorly for the interest in really spending up this holiday season. So we think the consumer's still in good shape, just a little bit more cautious than last year and allocating their dollars to different things. Lorraine, one key problem in retail ahead of this holiday season. We were just showing the chart on inventory growth. The retail industry is a wash in inventory. There is a lot of discounting in this environment. Who sees the biggest gross profit margin pressure operating margin pressure? And who's at risk of, you know, coming out in early January and issuing a major earnings warning? Yeah, look, we have earnings coming up for retail. We think that they will issue pretty cautious outlooks for 4Q because retail inventories are at all time record highs. Now, some of this is because they brought in inventory early. Remember last year the shelves were bare. They stocked out of a lot of goods. So they wanted to make sure they were in stock. But a portion of it is also they were forecasting demand that just hasn't materialized. So we've seen the consumer take a little bit of a step back in mid June and then we've seen some slowing since then in September. So we think there is too much where we see the biggest risk or those retailers targeting the lower income consumer. You've seen excess inventory levels at retailers like old Navy, like Coles, where the consumer is just has it's just a little bit tighter. On the good news side who cleans up those messes, the off price retailers, they really thrive on problems with the inventory and and excess thereof. So we think that retailers like TJ Maxx, Burlington, raw stores will be getting a tremendous amount of really high quality, well branded inventory really starting this quarter. The rain, that's the glass half full part of the equation. I want to go back to the glass half empty part of the equation because we all have been getting this sort of increasingly desperate emails right from some of the retailers offering heavy discounting some of the retailers. The big guys like Target and Walmart, they've said we're really addressing this inventory build up. But across the board and retail, do you think that the inventory glut is going to get worse before it gets better? Is the discounting working to work off that inventory? So we expect the mismatch between supply and demand to peak in the fourth quarter. So we do think holiday will be very promotional. You will get some great deals and that'll help us stretch to consumer. We do expect though that as we hit the end of the fourth quarter. So for retail, that's end of January that they will have worked through it. We think January will be a very heavy clearance period as most of the retailers are laser focused on exiting the winter season with appropriate levels. When we look to the first half of fiscal 2023, most retailers already had a chance to cut orders. So when spending pulled back a little bit in June and July, most retailers called their factories and their partners and told them to make less they cut they canceled. And so we do see some improvement in that in the first half of 23. Now that doesn't mean that they'll be pristine, but versus 4Q, we think they'll be in much better shape. All right, one of your top picks is Starbucks. Now there's this new CEO getting ready to take the helm there. Have you met with him? Have you talked to him about his plan for the company looking out over the next few years? So Starbucks is actually covered by one of my colleagues that it was one of our top holiday picks in my sector. My top holiday pick is tapestry, which owns coach and Kate's paid. So, well, to give us give us more details on this is do you think in general that the higher end consumer is going to be more resilient here? And that's why you like tapestry or do you think tapestry is doing something in particular right even in the luxury universe? I think a little bit of both actually, you know, we think tapestry is one of the few retailers that really did transform during the pandemic. And they took a few actions that we think are really important for the staying power of their earnings. They cut a lot of costs and reinvested those in marketing. They eliminated the bottom 40% of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,32,2022-11-02 16:06:30
4639," actions that we think are really important for the staying power of their earnings. They cut a lot of costs and reinvested those in marketing. They eliminated the bottom 40% of their styles to make their equipment more efficient. And they also added an e-commerce business to their outlet business, which we think added a new customer, a younger customer. So those things combine to give us more confidence in the sustainability of their high teens margins. And with those high teens margins come great cash flow. So we're expecting tapestry to buy back 7% of its stock and pay a 3% yield every year. And given the stock is near-troth multiples at five times EBITDA, we think that sets up really nicely into holiday and into 2023. So Cryptocurrency exchange finance helping to fund Elon Musk's deal for Twitter to tune of $500 million. Binance says it hopes to help Twitter buy better and corporate and crypto into the platform. Here to talk about that prospect, Chang, Peng, Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance and our very own crypto reporter David Hollerick. CZ, always good to see you. Thanks for giving us some time here. Is this more of a bet on Elon Musk or more of a bet on the future of Twitter's platform? I think to be honest, it's a bit of both. I think first of all, we want to sports free speech. And this is one of the best choices, the best chances to do that. Elon Musk is a very strong entrepreneur. We want to support him too. And crypto, Twitter is a ton square for crypto and most of the worst hard topics. So it's a good place to support free speech. And CZ, you know, Elon Musk has sort of gone back and forth at least from what we've seen in court documents that showed his text messages. He was initially talking about doing sort of a blockchain Twitter to improve some of the problems he's laid out for the company. And then he also has said that maybe that's not possible. Maybe it just won't work. And I'm curious to this juncture, what you're thinking about a crypto implementation or Twitter might look like and how realistic you think it is. I think Twitter today is a centralized platform. So moving that in one giant step into a fully decentralized platform is going to be quite difficult. I think we've got to get there in incremental steps. And for any.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,33,2022-11-02 16:10:48
4640," So moving that in one giant step into a fully decentralized platform is going to be quite difficult. I think we got to get there in incremental steps. And for any entrepreneur or any company in today's environment, we got to make many adjustments as time goes on. So it's very natural for his stock process to change over time. But overall, Elon is a very strong entrepreneur and we want to support him. So, see, Elon has been making some strategic moves with regard to who he's placing within Twitter, who he's bringing over from Tesla into the new Twitter that he sees moving forward. He's even said previously that the Twitter board that he decides to put together won't be paid if he was successful in acquiring the company. Post acquisition and knowing how much you believe that Twitter could improve with some of the same technology that Binance already has perhaps and the same ethos as well, is this a position that you would want on Twitter's board? I'm not against it, but I'm also not actually pursuing it. I'm not very good sitting on boards. I don't enjoy those type of long meetings, etc. But if my help is needed, I'm happy to, but I'm pretty busy running Binance. We want to keep all the support we can, but we'll see what Elon decides. Speaking of sticking to your knitting and running Binance, I mean, we see obviously Elon Musk, who is running a couple other companies. Now he's doing Twitter. And the initial reports coming out, frankly, have the feel of throwing spaghetti against the wall, as we say. In other words, maybe we'll charge people for the checkmarks. Maybe we'll take away free ads from Twitter blue. Like, there's all this stuff sort of trickling out. It doesn't feel like there is a unified strategy coming from Musk right now at Twitter. As an investor, and as a user, what do you want to see? I think that's very, very normal. As an investor, as a user, and also a fellow entrepreneur, I think it's very common to have many different ideas and see what sticks. So it's really literally like throwing spaghetti on the wall and just hope something sticks. That's entrepreneurship. So many different ideas should be tried and should be tried quickly. I think that my, as a user, might be as problem with Twitter is over the last year or a couple years, there hasn't been a lot of new features being introduced. There should be new features every month, every week, every day. And we just see what sticks. That's very normal. Like, what's easy? Like, what would be the thing that you would want to see from Twitter in terms of a new feature? I actually agree with a lot of what Elon's idea is, edit button. The way, let's block spam bots. There's a lot of bots that spam me my comments section when I open my tweets for comments. And blue ticks, they should become more, they should be a cost to it. I actually really support that idea. So all of this shouldn't really take more than a week to implement each. So we should have done that like, you know, a year ago. So I'm very supportive of Elon's idea. Let's, let's move quickly. Let's try new ideas. Yeah, to that point too, as one of the largest benefactors of cryptocurrency trading volume, thinking of this whole bot situation, there are, we know from the crypto side of Twitter that there are plenty of accounts that share coins and pump the price and things like that. So I'm curious, given that you're also thinking about the free speech mentality on Twitter, how do you think that problem is solved? Now that you have a financial stake. I think there's a balance between free speech and also pump and dump marketing manipulation, hate speech, just or just pure lying or fake information. So there has to be a line that to be drawn. It's not an easy problem to solve to be honest, but I think Elon's in a much better position to solve that problem than the look to the screen currently. There's too many spam balls on Twitter today. And so with regard to the hate speech, though, do you think that there is a significant policy change that needs to be enacted in order to make sure that that is removed from the platform, that it is not just a place for free speech, but also a place where free speech is not convoluted with hate speech on the platform? I think that's a very fine line to draw. It's going to be tricky. I think...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,34,2022-11-02 16:15:07
4641," where free speech is not convoluted with hate speech on the platform. I think that's a very fine line to draw. It's gonna be tricky. I think between hate speech and free speech, that's a very fine line. But some of the other stuff are much more clear. Fake news, spam, spam, much easier. So, you see, one part of making a good return on investment like this is Elon running an effective business, whether it's sales or profits, do you support him laying off 75% of that Twitter workforce to get those profits? I think those are the two different things. I think laying off a portion of the staff is just to become more efficient. Twitter today doesn't have a very strong business model, but it could potentially have very strong business models. So I think those two things are separate. It's not to say, I think revenue is not by saving cost. Not revenue doesn't come from saving cost. That's, I think Twitter's ability to generate revenue via C, via C is cost center today. There's many new revenue models that can be implemented on Twitter, like charging for blue ticks, even charging for comment, issue NFTs for each tweet, issue on token in the future. So all of those things can generate revenue for Twitter and it's not limited by the cost savings. Winx Stop is coming off a better than expected quarter for sales. As diners embrace the company's new chicken sandwich, it also helps from our profit perspective that chicken wing prices have started to, or they have flown lower. Let's check in with Winx Stop CEO, Michael Skipper. Mike Good to see you as always. Last time we talked to you guys, we're really one of the first restaurants to call out deflation. Are you still seeing those deflationary prices? And how long do you think it will last? Brian, we are. We're enjoying meaningful deflation in our business today. Just as we wore back when we spoke a quarter ago. And as we look at some of these leading indicators around our overall supply chain, it seems to suggest a backdrop of continued favorability from a commodity perspective for the balance of 2022 and into the beginning of 2023. A lot of new menu items that you've rolled out over the course of this year, Michael, how do you continue to kind of look through some of the performance indicators and in different markets as you kind of continue to look through the menu and what consumers even regard this as pricing,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,35,2022-11-02 16:19:39
4642," of the performance indicators and in different markets as you kind of continue to look through the menu and what consumers even, regardless of pricing, what they're gravitating towards right now. Yeah, WingStop's in a really unique spot in that in the second quarter our business was hit with the perfect storm and we were able to lean into a proven value playbook as well as pull some unique growth levers that we have as a brand and one of those being leaning into menu innovation and introducing chicken sandwich to consumers out there. First time we've done that as a brand and we think that's a meaningful long term sustaining a sales driver for our business and just launching that along with some of the other levers we pulled translated to a 6.9% same store sales growth in the third quarter and what's really great about that growth is the majority of that came with transaction growth. I think we've talked to you about this last time Michael with the prices, the raw material prices coming down for you guys. I don't imagine your cutting prices for consumers but I imagine maybe you're keeping them steady. How long do you, do you, I mean for the foreseeable future do you think we'll see some stability there? We've talked about the unique spot we're in this year where we haven't had to take any price where the rest of the industry to manage their margins has had to take meaningful price this year and you're seeing that start to impact some of the transactions in their business and we've been able to lean into that value playbook and not necessarily take any price this year and percent consumers with meaningful value so they can enjoy that indulgent wingsstop occasion. Michael my team here doesn't think I watch football but I in fact do and I was watching football and I've seen you guys start to pop up on TV. Are you getting return on that investment in the NFL and what does it look like? We are Brian we're seeing a meaningful increase in our investment and advertising this year. The back half of this year we're increasing our investment over 35% and you're seeing this as you mentioned show up in a big way in in in NFL as well as the NBA that's just kicked off in life sports and that's helping us close the gap that we have in brand awareness to other national brands that are out there and again another one of those multiple sales driving levers that we have that give us confidence in our ability to deliver our 19th consecutive year of same store sales growth this year. Are people coming in store are they ordering through digital app what is that touch point especially when you think about that customer acquisition cost and the awareness generation that you're ramping up right now. Yeah wingsstop's been an industry leader from an investment in digital and we had a really strong digital business before the pandemic hit and then obviously we saw explosive growth during the pandemic in our digital business already a business that was heavy off premise over the last three years through the third quarter we've seen ourselves grow north of 36% and that digital business that our reference is over 60% of our business today and that's a stickiness that we've been able to really hold since consumers have started to normalize their behavior a little bit to pre pandemic behaviors but those digital customers that we've brought into our brand we've been able to hold on to them and continue to build from there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,36,2022-11-02 16:23:51
4643," you Please welcome back Welcome back. Shares of SoFi, surging this morning after the financial services company topped analyst expectations for Q3 and raised their full year guidance. So for the third straight quarter, joining me now to discuss results of CEO Anthony Nodo and Yahoo! Finances, Brian Sasi, also in the house. Anthony just want to ask you about the results here. Double your GapNet revenue of 56% to $424 million. How would you describe these results? The results really reflect the diversification that we benefit from because we are one stop shop for financial services products and that we provide the ability to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect. So we're seeing businesses like personal loans, asset businesses like home loans and student loans in addition to our SoFi Checking and Sales Account. We're offering 2.5% on checking with direct deposit and 3% later this week on savings. Having really strong account openings which leads to deposits and leads to more spending. We're seeing very strong trends in invest which is also diversified. We have single stocks as well as cryptocurrency, Robo accounts and ETFs. Then we also have a credit card insurance product. So the continued growth that we're seeing with our 6th consecutive quarter of revenue is a reflection of our ability to overcome market volatility, the macro economic backdrop because of the diversification of the businesses that we have. Anthony mentioned on the earnings call a little while ago that you haven't really had a year where everything came together. Do you think you have that year next year? I think from a SoFi operating standpoint we do. This year we spent transitioning to a bank. Last year we spent transitioning to a public company and navigating the process with a SPAC merger into a public company. The year prior to that we were still in build out mode on the technology stack platform or Galeo and Texas businesses are doing quite well and that was a big part of the story back in 2020. And all that time really dealing with a depressed student loan refinancing business because of the federal student loan moratorium. So the economy is definitely volatile and there's a lot of uncertainty. If it stays at a contraction of minus 2 or minus 1%, I think we're going to be well positioned to continue to drive great trends, especially with the student loan moratorium ending in December. And when that does end in December, Anthony, what does that mean for your first half results next year? Is it a profit boom? What does it look like? There's so many variables that we'd have to know to answer that question. I think if the environment is exactly the same as today, which is unlikely, we definitely benefit from our resurgence in student loan refinancing demand and still strong trends in the businesses that are doing well now. And we believe our homeland business will be in a much better position by early next year, given the number of changes that we've made in the technology and the ability to close faster on a purchased mortgage, which is more critical than in a refinancing market. So I feel like we're going into the year set up to do really well and set more records. If the economy stays where it is or slightly less from a contraction standpoint, we're going to really, really good spot. We want a compound growth, we grew 51%. This quarter and a year, your basis in revenue with really strong profits and 61% number growth. We want to keep those growth rates quite high. Anthony, your company is growing strong. And I want to know if there's anything in your earnings results that would indicate trends, maybe that reflect what's going on in the larger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,37,2022-11-02 16:28:06
4644," Hi. Anthony, your company is growing strong. And I want to know if there's anything in your earnings results that would indicate trends, maybe that reflect what's going on in the larger economy, something that might surprise us, or just kind of confirm what's going on, the big picture here. Well, the higher interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve raising them to try to offset inflation and cool down the economy is driving a refinancing boom for personal loans. People are refinancing at a revolving rate debt and to fix rate term debt. And so that is, that business is definitely benefiting from, from that trend. The interest rates that we're providing on checking at 2.5% and 3% on savings later this week are a direct result also of higher interest rates. We are passing on the rate increases in our other products and the deposits that we're getting are allowing us to do that at a lower, lower cost. So there's a lot of complimentary elements of our business where one fuels the next. We call that the financial services productivity loop. And that's what you're seeing play out in our results. Anthony, switching gears just a little bit. As the former CLO and CFO of Twitter, what is your take on everything we've been seeing there? I would say first and foremost, I think Twitter has unbelievable potential. And that potential needs to be unlocked through the right product innovations. I think historically, you know, the company what I've seen has great potential. It has the best content in the world, regardless of what's happening in the world. You can see that on Twitter. The challenges, the content is there. It's hard to extract it through the product interface. And there's always been this challenge of getting consensus view or everyone on board inside the company or at the board level. And I think for the first time you have a single owner and a single leader that could be decisive. And the reason that's so critical is you need to iterate at an incredibly fast base to figure out what types of product changes will actually unlock that value. And it's really hard to do in a state where there are so many stakeholders that have a say. Now, there's one that gets the control of decisions and the consequences and the accountability. And I think that's the right form of whether it's the right team and they picked the right things. And they execute well, I have no perspective. What type of products do you think would work? What does charging 50 bucks to get on the platform or for the blue check mark? Does that make sense? You know, I was having fun with the debate on Twitter hopping into that conversation. I have a lot of insights of what would work, but it's not really my position to talk about them. It's really up to that team to execute the way they see fit. But I think they should have billions of users given the content they had that's so valuable. And they should be valued in hundreds of billions of dollars, not tens of billions of dollars. And I like that value. It looks like we've got time for another one. I happen to be reviewing your Twitter feed earlier this morning. I know you're a big affixionado of the NFL having served in an executive capacity there at one time. Any predictions for the season? I don't have any predictions for the season. Other than we really love our relationship with Stan Kronke, the Los Angeles Rams and Dean Spanos from the Los Angeles Chargers. It's been a great partnership with them. It's really provided us with the leverage in building our brand awareness that we thought it would. They far exceeded expectations with what they have at the venue that just announced two shows of for Taylor Swift at the end of her tour, which will be phenomenal. We had the Super Bowl last year. The Olympics will be there as well as the World Cup and this year the College Football Championship. So I call it the eighth wonder of the world. It's an iconic platform. Every artist, sports league, we'll want to play in that platform. And it's for an agreed partnership that's brought us really strong credibility and awareness. So it couldn't be happier with the relationship. I'm excited about the New Taylor Swift album. Big fan, big big fan, huge. I'm excited about anything that causes you guys to cover, and SoFi Stadium for a media standpoint. Well done sir. Talk about it as much as you can. We're all getting excited. I really appreciate you stopping by. SoFi CEO Anthony Dogeau and Yahoo Finance is Brian Sausie. Thank you for that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,38,2022-11-02 16:32:27
4645," you you you whats yelling December 14th, and whether or not inflation is decelerated enough to justify a smaller move, even just a quarter point. Our next guest has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his work covering the Fed and is out with a new book on the former Fed Chair and Current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Nice to have John Hilsenwath, Jim, apparently. I'll see you're a writer for the Wall Street Journal in studio with us. I'd be so much worse. Yeah, believe me today. Probably, right? Good to see you, man. So look on Twitter. No one, no better barometer. Exactly. So let's talk about tomorrow's meeting, all but certain, as we mentioned, their 75 point hike. What's your biggest question about what we'll hear from Jerome Powell? Well, you know, I think, so he's kind of opened the door to slowing down the pace of rate increases. And the question is, does he open the door a little bit? How is he open the door? Well, he said, if we see clear and convincing evidence that inflation is slowing, then we'll consider it. So the question is whether in the meeting itself, they've started to talk about that. Frankly, I actually think the really important moment isn't tomorrow. It's not the Fed meeting. It's next Thursday, because next Thursday is when the CPI inflation numbers come out. And he said they want to see clear and convincing evidence. So that's when you look for the clear and convincing evidence. Do you think they have seen it? No. Okay. No, I think that they've been disappointed. There were starting to see some signs of it this summer, and the last couple of readings in the CPI reports were very disappointing. So, John, what about some of these issues or concerns that people have that the Fed isn't taking enough time for things to digest and be reflected in the real economy? I think that's a totally fair and legitimate question. And it's surprising to me that you don't hear more of that coming out of the Federal Open Market Committee itself. You know, there's a lot of very independent, minded Federal Reserve Bank presidents who you would think some of them would say at this point, all right, we've done a lot. Let's slow things down and see how it's doing. But Jerome Powell has the Fed really moving in the direction that he wants. And that's to move very aggressively. I think one of the real concerns is that there's a lot of momentum that you get behind Fed decisions. And they do three quarters of a percentage point. It's hard to get off that because if they slow down, then everyone says, oh, they're going to stop. And if they stop, everyone says, oh, they're going to cut rates. The market is always two steps ahead of them. So the Fed is kind of stuck in this path of continuing to do what they're doing because they're afraid that the market's going to get ahead of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,39,2022-11-02 16:36:45
4646," to them. So the Fed is kind of stuck in this path of continuing to do what they're doing or else because they're afraid that the market's going to get ahead of them. And John, just taking a step back, just your assessment of the economy right now, because when you take a look at the latest GDP report, when you take a look at the jobs out of that we got out this morning, job openings, every single thing or most data points, still point to the fact that it is a very resilient economy. Yet there is this fear out there that we are going to slip into our recession. Where do you stand on that debate? Well, we got a good GDP report a week or so ago, 2.6% in the third quarter and it contracted in the first half of the year. The worry is that, like, that's the best we're going to get this year. We're seeing a big slowdown in housing, we're seeing consumer spending slowdown. The rest of the world is looking very weak. So I think there, I mean, and the economists that we survey every quarter are saying recession in 2023. So I think that's a real risk. And I think the Fed has kind of potentially created a momentum behind all these rate increases that they're having a hard time scaling back, which is why they're going to be praying on Wednesday night, next Wednesday, not this Wednesday, that those inflation numbers start to soften. Because, you know, they probably would like to slow this thing down at this point. But the loose credibility, if they do it before the inflation numbers tell off a little bit. So John, when you think of the conversations behind this scene, when you do have these periods, and before the Fed makes an announcement like this, especially as you studied how Janet Yellen has moved in the family dynamic that came into sort of the policy making there, give us some insight into sort of the conversations that might be happening right now. Well, I mean, I think that the most important thing you have to think about when you're watching the Fed and the market is always watching the Fed is, it's a very glacial moving institution. Unless there's an actual crisis in their face when they can do things overnight, they tend to take months and months and months to move the ship in a new direction, which is why they were behind the curve on raising rates to begin with. Because it took them too long to say, oh, wow, we're out over our skis. We kept rates too low for too long. And they might be running into the same problem now on the back end of this that, you know, they're not going to want to see clearer and convincing evidence that's Jay Powell's terms before they slow the pace of rate increases. Well, by the time they've slowed it down and stopped it, we might already be in a recession. So, you know, what I would say about the debate is it's very slow moving. And I always try to kind of look at just kind of incremental changes. There's somebody new in there saying, well, what about this or what about that? And so if I mean, I haven't done these press conferences in a while, if I were doing it, I would want to know, well, how did the debate change? Not what did you do today, but what did you start talking about that we might see in the next meeting or two in December or January? So it's bottom line. Goldman has 75, 50, 25 and 25 again in March. Do you agree with that consensus? Oh, you know what? I don't. I don't. You don't do that. You don't do that. That's the answer. I mean, I think, you know, I kind of rather talk about kind of risks and stuff like that. And I think there's a risk that they're going too far and that they've moved too fast too far. And the risk, I think, is to the financial system. So, I mean, the economy has been growing, you know, very fast. It needs to slow down and I understand all that. But when the Fed raises rates aggressively, even when it raises rates slowly, stuff tends to break in financial markets. And so, you know, what I wonder about is what's breaking out there right now that we might be learning about in one, three, six months. And so, you know, we might find out about it. And, you know, we have to see inflation slow down. That's the bottom. That's been the bottom line all year. And it just hasn't happened, which is disappointing, I think, for every American right now. It is disappointing. It's certainly caught a Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen off guard, I think, a bit just in terms of how sticky this inflation has been. I know you had a number of conversations. We have a new book here on set. Congratulations. I think we're holding that up. Of course, of course. I've got your bottle of champagne on your mic. Very old crack and open for it. But I guess you're take away from the biggest lessons that maybe she has learned and are more than two decades in Washington. And then also point you to the fact that there have been some rumors that she could be stepping aside as Treasury Secretary Paul.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,40,2022-11-02 16:41:09
4647," Biggest lessons that maybe she has learned in her more than two decades in Washington and then also pointed to the fact that there have been some rumors that she could be stepping as high as Treasury Secretary following the midterms or thoughts on that. And I guess who could potentially be the next Treasury Secretary? Right. So let me take the last question first. So I asked her about this just a week and a half, two weeks ago. And she said to me very emphatically, she does not intend to leave the job. And that she likes doing it. She thinks it's important. She could see herself staying there for four years. Given the fact that these rumors have been going around, I doubt she would have said that unless A, she had really thought it through. And B, unless she knew she was talking on the Wall Street Journal, I don't think she would have said it unless she had told the White House she was going to say it. So when she said she plans to stick around after the midterms, I believe her. Right now there's a lot of rumors out there. But you never know where they're coming from, they just kind of float around in Washington and sometimes, you know, and they get repeated. When the person who the rumors are about says, I don't intend to leave very publicly, I don't know. I mean, maybe I'll be caught off on this, but you know, I doubt she would have said it unless she believed it and she had told the White House she was going to say it. And then the biggest lessons from the 20 years. So you know, that's a big, that's a big, long answer. I'll say two things. First of all, you know, there's a lot of ideological debate in Washington and over the airwaves and, you know, conservative policies, liberal policies, spend too much, tax too little. What I found is that in watching her careers, that the big mistakes that have been made over the years, they haven't been ideological. It's been human error. It's been kind of misjudging where you are right now. So this inflation is a great example of it. So the federal government dumped money into the economy during COVID. In part because we had been through a decade of very low inflation and they thought they could. And they were learning the lesson of the last expansion and applying it to this one. And they just, they fought the last war and they misread the situation and now we have inflation. I would call it human error more than ideological error. And it boggles my mind because we debate ideological issues all the time, but it's really like, are you making the right, and this is what she said to me, you've got to look at the facts on the ground right now and read the environment. The other thing I'd say about Janet Yellen that kind of drew me to the story is this is a woman in a very male dominated field. A field that hasn't been very friendly, frankly, to women over the years. She broke every single glass ceiling in that field and I think you can learn some lessons about the workplace balancing work and family from her story. One of the great parts of the story that I focus on in the book, it's actually a love story. Yellen and her husband, the partnership that the two of them formed, you know, him taking on full respect, this guy won a Nobel Prize in economics, right? He took on full responsibilities at home and she took on, you know, equal responsibilities in the workplace and the two of them together became the most powerful influential couple in the economics industry by creating a partnership, equal partnership on both sides. It's a really interesting story. Yeah, certainly a remarkable story. And like you said here in the title, Yellen, the trailblazing economist who navigated an era of upheaval. John Hilton, great to have you on set. Thanks so much for joining us. It was fun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,41,2022-11-02 16:45:35
4648," you you Subscribers September 2011 2014 on Wall Street with revenue up 18% from just a year ago for more on that we want to bring in Connor Flynn CEO of Kimco Realty Connor. It's great to see you again. So it doesn't look like when we talk about the fact that the real estate market is slowing down a possible recession looming. Obviously you would think what I mean. Pretty concerning time for your business. Kimco though seems to be in a pretty great position. What's your assessment just of where you stand and what we could likely see over the coming months? That's great to see you too. Thanks for having me. You know, Kimco is in the sweet spot of retail right now. Grocery anchored shopping centers, which is what we primarily own, continues to be in the retail revival. You're seeing it with demand across all the different square footages that we have in our shopping centers. And a lot of it has to do with some major takeaways that we were net beneficiaries of the pandemic. So the big key is really understanding that brick and mortar versus e-commerce. That debate is really settled. It really is a combination of the two that is the sweet spot that makes retailers more profitable and connect deeper with with their consumer. And that's what's really driving the robust demand across our shopping centers is when you think about the big powerhouses of e-commerce, they're actually all opening physical stores. And they're using those stores not only to sell merchandise out of it, but using it as last mile distribution fulfillment. And that's the game changer. That's really what's driving our robust results and allowing us to beat and raise multiple times this year. Oftentimes we've heard about the death of brick and mortar conner and yet the numbers are astounding right now. Retail vacancies in the second quarter, 6.1 percent, the lowest in 15 years, more stores opened than closed in 21 for the first time since 1995. What is pushing people back to stores? And in some cases away from e-commerce. Well, I think a lot of it has to do with human nature. I think when something is taken away from you, all of a sudden you start to realize how much you really need that or you want it. And I think that's what happened. And what we're seeing is a robust surge in services. So a lot of people during the pandemic really spent all of their dollars on goods. And now you're seeing it really shift back towards the service part of the economy. And with the growth-drinkered shopping center, that only comes down to the hair salons, the nail salons, a lot of the medical, the health and wellness uses that are doing quite well today. So you're seeing it across the spectrum of what really works today in retail. And the fascinating part is the consumer still is engaging in the shopping center on a higher rate than they were even last year. And that's good news for shoppers and that's good news for retailers and obviously where sales go, we can increase rents then. And when you take a look at some of the, I guess, some of your larger tenants, you have all the big names from T.J. X to Home Depot to Whole Foods as your anchor tenants. They make up about 54% of your space there. But you also have large exposure to small shop tenants, maybe a 46% of your portfolio. With the risk of recession, fears that maybe some of the smaller shops won't be able to pay their rent. Are you starting to see any evidence of this? We're looking for it, but we haven't seen any cracks yet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,42,2022-11-02 16:49:42
4649," the smaller shops won't be able to pay their rent. Are you starting to see any evidence of this? We're looking for it, but we haven't seen any cracks yet. And one of the things to keep in mind with the small shops, which sometimes makes you think about maybe the local Pizzeria, our small shops are large national chains. So JP Morgan Chase is actually the largest small shop tenant that we have in the portfolio. And you go across the top 50 small shops and all of them are national and typically a high credit rated company. So we've seen it just across the board in terms of demand right now, really driving our results. And it's a nice part to be where I can let the results speak for themselves because a lot of people had made up their mind on physical brick and mortar retail and you could talk until you're blue in the face and sometimes better just let the results speak for themselves. Just curious what you make of these new numbers out from alignable that show 37% of small businesses unable to pay their rent for the month of October. The number we just showed 50% in Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey right there on its heels, Pennsylvania, also in the top five, these are states where you have properties. Yeah, that's an interesting stat. I mean, think about the Kimco consumer and the Kimco shopping center. We're typically the first ring suburb in the major metropolitan areas across the country. And that's where the affluent shopper continues to engage in the in the shopping center. I'm thinking that that stat may include maybe some of the lower demographic areas. And when you think about the inflationary pressures that people are really dealing with today, that's where we've seen, I think the lower demographic really feel the brunt of the issues that are that are facing the economy today is the inflationary impact is really having a dramatic effect on that lower demographic profile. Fortunately, Kimco is positioned really in the higher affluent areas, the first ring demographic, the first ring suburb is where again, you saw the suburbanization effect take hold in the pandemic. So again, we were in a beneficiary from that migration pattern. And Connor Flynn, always great to have you CEO of Kimco Realty. We look forward to having you back again soon. Thanks for joining us. Music raising rates of, led to tough times in the housing market, both buyers and sellers stuck on the sidelines with the 30-year fixed north of 7% for the first time in 20 years. There are some exceptions to the rule, however. Alyssa Helman is a broker for my Southern view. Alyssa nice to see you. So the Wall Street Journal, Emerging Markets Index, lists Johnson City, Tennessee. I feel like I should sing it every time, thanks to Derrius Rucker. That's number one on the list ahead of Viselia, California, Elkerton, D.A.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,43,2022-11-02 16:54:14
4650," Johnson City Tennessee. I feel like I should sing it every time thanks to Derrius Rucker. That's number one on the list ahead of Vesalia, California, Elkord, Indiana, North Port floor to Fort Wayne, Indiana round up the top five in your town. Raleigh, North Carolina, cracking the top 10. What do these cities have in common in terms of real estate markets? Absolutely. So I think the biggest thing that you're seeing with rising rates is affordability has gone dramatically down. And so when you look at markets like Johnson City, like Brawley, the one thing that a lot of those places having come in is you can still find affordable homes and compete in a way that a lot of these really competitive markets such as San Francisco, Chicago, places where buyers were really priced out, they can still with higher interest rates compete and afford in some place like Johnson City or Brawley. Now it's interesting because Alyssa, we know a lot of people move to sub-urbs, they move to other areas for affordability reasons when they were able to work remotely because of the pandemic. But do you think that's going to be the case now as employers put more pressure on some workers to return to the office? I do. I actually have seen 2021 and 2022 both were years where I saw a dramatic influx of relocation buyers coming to Raleigh, not unlike many of the other markets that you guys mentioned, but part of that was getting priced out in these bigger markets. Right now, when you look at interest rates, you're talking about the average 30 year fixed being 7%. That means that 85% of current homeowners have a lower rate. And so it doesn't make a lot of sense for those folks to move. So when you start looking at affordability, how can I afford my next place? Where do I want to be for five, 10 years? A lot of those other markets are really coming into play and coming into the conversation where folks are saying maybe I want to be closer to family. Maybe I want to be somewhere else where my paycheck isn't stretched as thin as it is in other markets. In particular, those first time buyers who really been priced out, I think those the ones you're finding in that top 10 list. So let's talk about the underlying issue here, which of course mortgage rates continue to get worse. If you can put in context, what a mortgage rate means when it's north of 7% in terms of how much more an average monthly payment has gone up. And if I can tack on to that, how high do you expect rates to get in the next six months? Yeah, so I'll answer the second part of that first because I think it's the less scary answer, I guess. My attitude is I think we've probably seen interest rates peak. I think that they've risen dramatically in the last six months and in a way that really wasn't predicted. The other element to that is we got pretty spoiled. Rates being lower than 4% for long periods of time, which we saw in 2020, 2021, a good portion of 2022, that's not the norm. It's not normal to see rates. It wasn't that long ago that I was closing homes at 2.75 or 3%. Those are dramatically low, low rates when you look at the historic history of where rates have been. So I do think that we've probably capped out where we're going to be. I don't think that we'll see a decrease back down to that necessarily 3% or 2.5% even, but I do think that we'll start to see a leveling off. The first part of your question, though, it's a big change. Homeowners are paying dramatically more just based on interest rates. What I'm having to have a conversation, especially with a lot of first time home buyers about, is if they got approved with a rate at 3.5%, 4%. I'm having to say to them, you really need to speak to the lender again before we go ahead and write an offer because rates have risen so much that it's actually priced some first time home buyers and some just in general buyers completely out of the price point they were looking. So they're having to just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,44,2022-11-02 16:58:25
4651," We priced some first time home buyers and some just in general buyers completely out of the price point they were looking. So they're having to just adjust the price point altogether. And I want to ask you about the inventory picture because obviously if you're a homeowner and you're seeing with these mortgage rates ahead and you want to sort of sit tight, enjoy your equity or perhaps wait till the market's frothy again. What is the expectations for inventory given the slow pace and the lack of confidence who've been seeing from home builders? Yeah, I actually think that's had a lot to do with this slow down. It's less about rates and more about where a lot of sellers are. We had an insanely low inventory, especially in Raleigh, for years due to the feeding frenzy that these low, low rates were causing. People were saying I'm not going to move because I don't know if I can compete in this craziness that the market is. Now you're seeing people saying rates have gone so high. I'm locked in at three and a half percent or four percent. Why would I go out and up size or downsize and be in a mortgage that's going to be more expensive at that rate? So I think you're seeing a lot of sellers stay put, but that said real estate is one of those basic human needs that is always going to function. So even in the recession of 2009, you saw people buying and selling homes. It still happens. We're still seeing need-based moves. We're still seeing people out there saying, hey, now that there's a little fewer buyers out there, maybe I can actually compete. Maybe I'm up against less competition. So there's some really good opportunities if you can find the right mortgage rate. The other element to that that I think is really important is we're so used to saying, okay, I'm closing on this house. I've gotten my mortgage and now I can forget about mortgage rates until I'm ready to buy again. That's not what we're advising anybody to do now. Instead I'm saying, go ahead, find the lowest rate that you can. But once you've bought, keep your eye on rates. When you see them start to decrease, look at refinancing and save yourself some money there just because you buy at a current rate right now. It doesn't mean that that's the rate that you have to stay at throughout the course of you owning that home. Refines of all but disappeared at the moment, Alyssa Helmer, nice to see you. Thanks so much. In this episode of influencers, Gregory Zuckerman, author of a shot to save the world. I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate it normally. I really do think it's modern science is greatest achievement. I believe that this pandemic is going to end but this virus is not going away. It's going to endemic. It's going to melt into the background but we're always going to have things dropping up. I write the same story all over and over and over. I write about overlooked, underappreciated individuals, achieving something that the experts told them they couldn't do. Hello everyone and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirwer. And welcome to our guest, Gregory Zuckerman, award winning journalist, special writer at the Wall Street Journal, an author of the new book, A Shot to Save the World, The Inside Story of the Life or Death Race for a COVID-19 vaccine. Greg, nice to see you. Great to see you Andy. So congratulations on the book. A lot to talk about. You've noted that you wanted to focus on the triumphs of the triumphs, I guess you should say, of the development of the vaccine. And one thing you talked about was a lucky break that occurred with regard to MRNA research which occurred a couple years before the pandemic, which probably allowed for the rapid development of the vaccine. What would the world look like if the pandemic had arrived five years earlier? Do you think we'd still be waiting for a vaccine? It's a great question. So I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate the enormity of it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,45,2022-11-02 17:02:45
4652," You. It's a great question. So I think we're too close to this miraculous development of these vaccines to appreciate the enormity of it. I really do think it's modern science is greatest achievement. And to your point, the technology was not ready a few years ago. So we need to be grateful that the pandemic that this virus emerged at a time when the scientists I write about in my book thought they had an approach that would work. They weren't sure we're talking the end of 2019 very early part of 2020. And they turned around the creativity is really effective protective vaccines. But again, a few years earlier, I don't think we would be nearly as lucky. But there's a few different types of science that have been applied to the different vaccines. You want to just go through them and sort of lay person's term, which I know is your specialty. Sure. So M RNA. We are familiar with that with that approach that vaccine approach because that created the Moderna as well as the Pfizer vaccines. M RNA short for messenger RNA, which is just a molecule we have inside of us. It transports instructions from the DNA to the part of the cell where proteins are created that we live on and it depends on every day. And it was always this sort of dream of scientists to create M RNA in the lab. Well, if it's so important in the body, maybe we could create a synthetic version just like there's, you know, sugar natural sugar and synthetic version of sugar. So the idea was, well, if we could create M RNA in the lab, we could tell our bodies to create any protein. And that was the idea. That's the gist of the M RNA approach. We is a vaccine. It sends a message and a message obviously in this case is an instruction for the body. The immune system to create the protein, the protein in this case is despite protein. So like any other vaccine, it's an education for the body. And the other approach I write about the adenovirus approach that leads to the J and J as well as the AstraZeneca vaccines. That's a really interesting one. Two. That one also took years in making and I read about how that began really with HIV effort to solve HIV. We haven't figured that one out yet, but they shifted these scientists and said, OK, we can't do HIV, but we're going to get a vaccine for COVID. Dan Baroque, one of the scientists working on that later endeavor, I spoke to has been at your right, been working on that for a very long time. But switching back to M RNA, you do focus a lot on Moderna, which could have been one of the biggest losers in the race for the vaccine, end up being a big winner. How much credit should the Moderna CEO get here? It sounds like his background as a salesman was sort of key in bringing us all together. Yeah, he's a fascinating character for years, people whispered about him. They suspected he was exaggerating murderers ability to create either vaccines or drugs. There wasn't much proof they were very secretive kind of firm. He was very hard on his employees. You could read about it in a book. People were collapsing in the office, out of the office at home hitting their heads, being rushed to the emergency rooms, he was firing people left and right. Very difficult. And yet inspirational too, and hard driving. And he had a vision. His vision was that M RNA was going to save lives. And he felt he needed to push his people hard. He's a little bit of a Steve Jobs kind of character in that regard. And he said, guys, one day we're going to be the ones to step up in a crisis. And he was right. And maybe it takes somebody like that. And like you said, he's a great salesman. And he raised billions and billions for Moderna over the years without any proof of concept. And people were jealous. There were a lot of envy in the industry, but turns out that that money was well spent to people made a lot of money investing in Moderna. Yeah, and I heard, you know, whispers in Boston in that biotech community about him for a while, just what you're sort of saying, Greg. And even while they were sort of getting up to speed that, you know, I mean, maybe charlatan is too strong a word, but they were serious doubters. Do you think those people, you know, are sort of eating crow right now? And in my book, I people compared him to Elizabeth Holmes. They said, just like Sarah knows, there's nothing there to this company Moderna. And you know, you can understand it to some extent, they didn't have any proof. They spent years working on drugs and outright in the book. They gave up on making mRNA work for drugs. They had to pivot to vaccines because it wasn't working with drugs and vaccines is not a really popular area for a lot of pharmaceutical companies. So are they eating crow? Yes. But, you know, there is some reason why they were skeptical all those years, but in the end, they were wrong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,46,2022-11-02 17:07:08
4653," popular area for a lot of pharmaceutical companies. So are they eating crow? Yes. But there is some reason why they were skeptical all those years, but in the end they were wrong. Right. Operation work speed. Where do you come out on that? I mean, this was a Trump administration program. Controversial, there were some, let's just say, colorful people steering it. But was it effective, Greg? So like most every other topic in society today, it's sort of black and white, against you. Either Operation Warp Speed saves everything, and we have to give Donald Trump all the credit, or it was useless. I come down somewhere in the middle, meaning that Operation Warp Speed was very helpful. There were a lot, there's a lot of money that was given to these companies, resources too. I'm a little park that were necessary from all over the country that were brought to the necessary spots on bioperape, to Warp Speed employees, but you also have to remember that Warp Speed made an early bet on a different vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine. It did not give money to my journal early on, when it was desperate for money. And Moderna, as recently as May, 2020, was running out of money and couldn't get money from the government, could get money from private industry, from public, from foundations, from Merck. They went to Merck, and they were almost unable to create these vaccines. We won't be able to be grateful for what happened. So Operation Warp Speed was very helpful in the end, Moderna did get a lot of money from Operation Warp Speed, others did too, but you don't want to save all due to Warp Speed as a success of these remarkable vaccines. There is the perspective case where the government's going to suggest that everyone gets every...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,47,2022-11-02 17:11:36
4654," There is the perspective case where the government's going to suggest that everyone gets every person in America gets a booster, flies a booster as well, right? Or Moderna, and I think that is coming, right. And also just sort of down the road, I believe that this pandemic is going to end, but this virus is not going away. It's going to be endemic. It's going to kind of melt into the background, but we're always going to have things cropping up areas that aren't vaccinating. We're going to have issues. It's going to morph and it's going to, we've got more strains. I'm not saying this to people for people to be too concerned. I do think Pfizer, Moderna and the other companies can adjust their vaccines. So you'll go in and there'll be second and third generation vaccines. You'll go into a doctor's office and get a COVID vaccine, but it'll be in all in one, maybe with a flu of vaccine. Maybe they'll throw something else in there too. So I don't want people to be too discouraged, but the vaccine research is that a right about there trying to stay ahead of this thing. Yeah, I mean, is that a losing battle? Is it going to be like the flu? Are we going to continue to need new vaccines all the time? I mean, this seems like it's not going to just end as you suggest. Yeah, it won't. Right. Right. But I wouldn't call it a losing battle. I think we'll stay ahead of it. And these vaccines are so much more effective than the flu vaccine. So if you've got protection of 70, 80 percent and it's even high of our hospitalization in and death, it will allow us to return to some to normal say, really in society. You hear that other countries vaccines are not as effective, you know, like the Chinese vaccine. I don't know where the Russian vaccine stands. I heard there was one in Cuba that was not not effective at all. Like why is that? Well, they use different approaches. So I write in the book a little bit of the Russian approach is a variation on the one that you mentioned with Dan Beruk and the J&J one. It's not quite as good. And frankly, we just don't have as much data that's reliable. It doesn't help that Putin himself didn't take the vaccine for months and months. He wouldn't take it. So listen, if that was the only vaccine in the world, either the Russian one or the Chinese one, I think we would all embrace it and take it. It's largely effective, but just not as effective. mRNA as revolutionary as it is. It just is so much better than these other vaccines. How come Merck and Santa Fe and other companies that are known as leaders in this space were not at the fore? That's a great question. And frankly, when I started researching this book, I kind of expected the vaccine giants to be the ones to save us. I mean, Merck is the one that created the MMR vaccine that we're all familiar with. The Mums' measles were bella there, vaccine giant. So the Santa Fe is just saying GSK. And yet they started to drag their feet. I write about some internal rift within Merck about whether to pursue a vaccine for COVID-19 or not. GSK and Santa Fe teamed up. But their approach isn't quite very yet. I would argue that vaccines until this past year are not a really sexy area for big pharmaceutical companies. You get one every few years or once a year, once a lifetime maybe, so much you can charge for a vaccine. And as a result, I think the big pharmaceutical companies had mixed feelings about chasing after a vaccine for COVID-19. There's no money there. There is, as we're seeing now this past year, but at the time it wasn't clear and listen, you put all this work into it. And they've done this. Merck has chased vaccines in the past for things like Zeke and such that have dissipated, gone away and they wasted tons of money, resources, et cetera, opportunity cost was it was high. So if you're going to chase after a vaccine and when you don't even know if there's going to be a need for it by the time you develop it, it's a risky business proposition. Right. Moderna just recently announced an agreement with Gavi, which the vaccine alliance to ship more vaccine doses to areas around the world that are still behind in 2022. Is this too little too late? I think it's popular to criticize Moderna. You see how much money they're making. There are always these suspicions about them. I think the back of people's minds, they remember that, that those those questions and they're eager to criticize Moderna. I'm not here necessarily to defend them, but I do have to note that they didn't have a partner unlike Beyond Tech, which works with Pfizer, but you're to confine a partner, Merck turned them down. So they had to do it all themselves and they've been taxed. They've been going to the limit. I know that people internally, they believe that they wish they.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,48,2022-11-02 17:15:49
4655," and they're gonna merc turn them down. So they had to do it all themselves. And they've been taxed, they've been going to the limit. I know the people internally, they believe that they wish they had been able to produce more, but they're vaccine supplies were scooped up by the West. They paid the most and they got there early. And now they're trying to help elsewhere. Is it too little to lay? I would say it's slow and happening, but I also understand what's going on internally with a Moderna. They have just destroyed physically, psychologically. It's been a really difficult year, even though they made a lot of money. By the way, you just saw the little mystery in my brain, Greg, beyond tech. That's how you pronounce it. You know, there are different ways of pronouncing it, even internally, they pronounce it differently. Yes, that's why I pronounce it beyond tech. You can't go wrong that way. It's like Tesla and Tesla. We ask the people there how to pronounce it. They said either. Really? That's funny. I didn't know that. So what about mRNA research? What do you think the next breakthrough is gonna come from there and how will this change the development of future vaccines? So there's a lot of excitement now about what mRNA can do besides COVID-19. Uguca Sahin and Beyond tech have been working on cancer vaccines for many years. They're very excited to take the billions they're making right now and shift and focus on other pathogens, ailments. Oh, and so it's Moderna. So we're talking about everything from Lupus and MS, turning off the immune system, just like we've been able to turn on the immune system perhaps for autoimmune kind of issues. Malaria, some people are going after. Dan Brook, as you mentioned, AIDS. So some of these same vaccine specialists, revolutionary, pioneering researchers that I write about in my book are shifting to all kinds of new challenges. Now, I want to caution just a little bit because until his past year, mRNA has proved pretty disappointing when it comes to drugs. And there are some vaccines coming up and believe for things like RSV and CMV, some viruses that are very lethal and harmful for some people. But I want to have a little bit of caution in terms of revolutionizing the world. But I'm excited about the future. I want to ask you about vaccine hesitancy as someone who intricately knows how these vaccines came to be. What do you make of these continued conspiracy theories around them? And how much are they hurting efforts to get everyone vaccinated? So Andy, I speak to a lot of vaccine who hasn't had audiences and I enjoy doing so. There's always a split. There are some people who are reasonable and cautious. And for good reasons, they're wary. I get it. These vaccines were developed in 330 days from the time the sequence was revealed until they were authorized. And historically, that's just remarkable. I mean, the average vaccine took 10 years until last year and the fastest was four years. So here we are coming in three and a three days. So I understand that the waryness in mRNA has never been proved effective. That said, one of the reasons I wrote my book is to show that it was years of research. It wasn't done quickly. They didn't cut corners in any way. What we've been able to do, and partly, thanks to warp speed, was we were doing things simultaneously. We were developing, testing, and manufacturing of vaccine. That's never been done before. Why would he spend billions of dollars to manufacture vaccine? And it's not even authorized or approved yet. No one ever did it historically. So those are the reasons why I think some people were hesitant. And I think they should be reassured by the fact that the work corners caught. And this process, this research, these vaccine approaches took years, and that's partly why I wrote the book. Now, in terms of conspiracy people, conspiracists, you're not going to make much headway there, sadly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,49,2022-11-02 17:20:15
4656," you you you you you you you've been skeptical understanding correct of the that you've been skeptical the so called loudly naar theory l the l the l the l the l the l the l the l it l the l the l the l the l the lab. But the pandemic's origin has been really difficult to pin down definitively. How much of you focused on that question in your reporting and do you think we'll ever have a clear answer there? So I am skeptical of the lab leak. I'm even more skeptical of that China created this vaccine. And my reporting is based on talking to top of biologists, structural biologists, et cetera, around the world. And the view is that it's a little bit like HIV HIV for years. There were suspicion about that as well. People accused CIA and you've got government, you've got Army, KGB of creating this virus because there was no natural host. There was no evidence of the animal that had the original virus. And then they found one. It took years about a decade or so. And likewise, we haven't found the host here. But I think it will be identified. It takes a little bit of time. Those people who say it was created by China. And then they said, well, it won't spread in China. We'll only only make spread elsewhere. That seems preposterous. And the lab leak is a possibility. I'd say it's a five or 10% possibility. But if you just remember that animals were encroaching on and wild kingdom all the time, cutting down trees, their jump viruses are jumping all the time from animals. We start with SARS. We start with the earlier coronaviruses and tumors, others. So to expect this one to be unusual and surprising and to be a bit leaked, it's possible but unlikely. I'm an Occam's razor kind of guy. Right. Is the wet market, does that come into play you think or is that kind of a blind alley? No, I think there's a good possibility that it's spread there. I'm not sure. They're originated there necessarily. But historically, that's the first one spread too. The first SARS in China in a wet market is a good chance that that's how it's spread. Right. And in recent weeks, when we talked about the pill a little bit, I just want to last follow question on that. And so is that a big breakthrough or not? I think it is. I think it's going to be kind of a one to punch. That's really going to help.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,50,2022-11-02 17:24:20
4657," And I just want to last follow question on that. And so is that a big breakthrough or not? I think it is. I think it's going to be kind of a one to punch. That's really going to help us get out of this pandemic as long as people continue to get vaccinated. But we've got this backup of pills that are quite effective. I think modern science is going to be fixing this thing and addressing this thing and helping us out of this pandemic. Yeah. What do you make of Tony Fauci? I mean, is he this American hero or listening to both journalists or like, ah, it's not all that? Where is he all that Greg? What do you think? I think Tony Fauci is a hero. His whole life is dedicated to public health. It's a remarkable and quite frankly, just depressing idea that we as a people are part of our country have turned on those who look out for us. Is he perfect? No. He advised us early on not to wear masks. He couldn't have been more wrong about that. The real kinds of mistakes he and other scientists have made. But for Tony Fauci and his colleagues at NIH, others, they could have quit years ago and made a fortune in private industry. And they didn't. Why? Because they look out for our health and they're trying to give us good advice and guidance. And he's also pushing the research. And he behind the scenes made a lot of contributions in terms of these vaccine approaches that are right about in my books. So we owe him and his colleagues a great deal of gratitude. They're not perfect whatsoever to make the stakes left the right, but who doesn't? Yeah, I think you're so right making that point that of course you could have become the top scientist of the giant pharma company, the anonymous and very wealthy living in a nice suburb and all that. But he decided. And then we would criticize him for the revolving door and how dare they go private industry after a public, yeah, they get it criticized either way. Yeah. After everything has happened over the past 18 months, do you think we're better equipped now, better prepared for the next pandemic? Well, I think so given that mRNA has been proven and we figure out how to manufacture it efficiently, distribute it, took us a little while, but we've learned a lot of lessons in terms of trials as well. So mRNA now we can depend on. So the next big pathogen, lethal virus that emerges, I think we can adjust and create vaccines quite quickly. Other lessons I don't think we've learned to me as a nation, we don't look out for each other like we should where a group of individualists and that's helped us arrive at these vaccines. And only in America could we, these vaccines have been created granted. There's one from Germany, but even the German CEO I've talked to who said without American investors, venture capitalists, people rolling the dice on their approach years ago when they went public when they were raising money, these vaccines could not have been created. So there's a lot to be proud of as an American, there's also a lot to be discouraged about about how we get advice from our brother-in-law or some video that we saw on YouTube as opposed to our own internist, it's pretty discouraging both for me, but also for the creators, the pioneers that I talked to for my book, when they see that all their hard work has led to this split and some people were resistant and pointing fingers at them for their efforts, it's quite discouraging. And at times left that we have left, Chair Greg, I want to ask you a little bit about you and the process and writing books, how did you decide to do this particular book? So I was deep in my basement office in New Jersey, locked down like everybody else, and kind of discouraged about the world, and I thought it could be a fun project to trace and speak to the researchers, the scientists, the pioneering kind of remarkable innovators that are behind these vaccines. I didn't know at the time that they'd be proven effective, but I kind of made a bet that they would and I tracked them along the way. So in some ways it was a healthy distraction for me, gave me encouragement. And my book is about what went right, as opposed to what went wrong, I wanted it to be an upbeat book. That gives us hope about the future because these vaccine specialists, they're turned, they're focused on other pathogens and other illnesses and viruses, and we're gonna need them again sadly, I think in the years ahead. And finally, Greg, so this is one of several books you've written, is there a common thread or how do you choose what to write about? I mean, it's such a big commitment. I read the last one that you did about a gym and assignments was great, but you're kind of the rolling the dice yourself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,51,2022-11-02 17:28:48
4658," right about. I mean, it's such a big commitment. You know, I read the last one that you did about Jim Simon's was great, but you know, you're kind of the rolling the dice yourself in the sense that like you're picking some of your committing to it and you hope that it resonates, right? Yeah. So Andy, one can criticize me because and I only realized this after I started to pass in my manuscript, I write the same story all over again, over and over. I write about overlooked, underappreciated individuals achieving something that the experts told them they couldn't do. And I write about that over and over again, unlike the heroes, I just happen to that resonates with me. I find that fascinating. Why is it that conventional wisdom is so wrong so often? All my books and my first book was about the financial crisis and the individuals who anticipated it shouldn't have been these guys. Then I run by the energy revolution. It should not have been these fracas and Oklahoma who turned this country around and should have been Chevron and BP. And like you said, my last book to Mano Salda Market is about a bunch of scientists who don't even care so much about capitalism and business with the greatest investment for men history. And this time it's a group of companies and approaches that were overlooked. M-R-N-A and these companies, Pfizer, notwithstanding beyond tech as the key person, key company behind the vaccine, Moderna and the others I write about. So I'm taken with that theme. I think it's one that you can learn a lot from and hopefully readers enjoy it as well. Well, as one reader, I certainly have, Greg. And so keep on doing it. I didn't realize that I didn't notice that theme throughout. So now I will be noticing that when, if and when you do another one. Yeah, I didn't notice myself until I passed it in. But yeah, I love like that theme a little bit of a David and Goliath. But I think there were lessons that can be learned about overcoming obstacles and criticism even and skepticism from the ex the so-called experts.

You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Surgwer. We'll see you next time. Fed's latest decision on interest rates. FOMC officials per se hiking rates by another 75 basis points. Right now we're seeing markets really tiptoe in that Fed decision. All three major indices slightly in the red. Now, here's what else is on tap for this hour. Tuning into Paramount. Yowel finds out that Ali Canal has some instant analysis when earnings results at a Paramount, which was also whacked by a Wells Fargo downgrade earlier in the week. And swiping the plastic, I talk about Mastercard CEO Michael Mibach on why he doesn't see a cold-filled holiday shopping season. And CEO ChatFest will also check in with the CEO's XPO, Travago and Rockwell automation to get a pulse on the global economy in two-year-end. Brad, over to you. All right. Thanks so much. Big Fed day. We're going to get to the decision later on this afternoon. We're taking a look at how the major averages are moving on today's session going into that announcement. And then the press conference as well. You're seeing the Dow down by about four tenths of a percent. Let's set the mood with some candlesticks here and take a look at some of the larger movements that have been taking place there. So getting just another look at some of the other major averages here on the day. We'll try to get markets back later on. Oh, there they are. Okay. Well, anyway, we've moved on. We're going over to sectors right now. Sector's on the day. As we had seen some major lagers throughout the early morning session, we've now seen all 11 S&P 500 sectors in negative territory, moving to negative territory. Financials has also slipped into the red. That's flat but to the downside. Take a look as well at consumer discretionary as we've been tracking that. That's down by about three tenths of a percent. And with that in mind, want to take a look at some of the retail names as I've been tracking those. And you've got a lot of red in retail right now. Amazon hyperwalfling, Walmart, down half a percent, home depot down four tenths of a percent. And take a look at the declines and lows moving lower on the day by about one percent. Also, you've got a host of others just to put this in broader perspective here at some of the declines on the day. You've got of course bedbath and beyond as well. That's down by about one percent right now. Julie, what do you think you're very much bad? And we're also watching shares of Paramount that are down about nine percent after an earnings miss as investments in its content marketing and international expansions bite with a recap of the media giant's earnings and the broader streaming landscape. We've got our own alley canal joining us right now. So Ali, tell us about this quarter and what stands out and what happened.

4659," We've got our own alley can out joining us right now. So Ali, tell us about this quarter and what stands out and what happened. Yeah, well, good morning, Julie. It's very clear investors are not too happy about this amiss on both the top and bottom lines. As you mentioned profits really suffered as a result of those greater investments in marketing content, international expansion, which Paramount has been really committed to week advertising revenue as well. That declined to percent the quarter. That's a big macroeconomic challenge at the industry as a whole has been grappling with that weight on the company's bottom line. CEO Bob Backish, though, he focused on the company's subscriber wins for the quarter. We did see a significant amount of growth Paramount plus adding 4.6 million subs for total of 46 million Pluto TV also seeing continued success with 72 million monthly active users. And as a whole, the company has nearly 67 million subscribers across its direct to consumer services. And executives said that there's more room to run here. The problem, though, that Wall Street seems to have is on the profit side. Can DTC alone save Paramount amid these linear TV challenges? We heard from Wells Fargo Steve K Hall earlier this week. He issued a second downgrade in less than a month on the stock. He suggested that Paramount take on the role of an arms dealer similar to what we've seen from Sony maybe license out of the company. He said that the company may be licensed out or sell off some of those assets. But back ish was specifically asked about the strategy on the earnings call. But he said that's not really part of their vision. He's really committed to keeping content on the platform. He says that's ultimately how you deliver value backish also confirming that price will be coming. He actually said this on our air during now finances all market is going to be on the market. So we're going to have to go over all though. Investors really struggling to find that silver lining shares seem to be accelerating their losses a bit down over 9.5%. Ali while we have you and we're zeroing in on the entertainment landscape. Netflix's ad supported tier that launching now to do we have a sense of where some of the conversations around where the what actual content will be on that ad tier right now this ad tier launching officially in the US tomorrow and the company did warn that about 5 to 10 percent of programming will not be available on this ad tier due to ongoing conversations surrounding the rights to air ads against some of this content. The Wall Street Journal confirming that those talks are still ongoing with several major studios and that includes some big guys are sitting on your screen now Disney NBC Universal Sony Disney's Ad Video. Some of these studios provide original content to Netflix. Others offer reruns, licensed their content. We're talking about some pretty big shows here. Graze in the crown you so it's very important that Netflix can get this right experts that I've spoken with have said advertising. Is the future for this company as it competes for subscribers and the revenue that comes along with that we have Disney's ad tier coming out next month. Many players So Netflix really trying to take a bite out of that market share, but in order to do that, you have to have the content of both the user side and the advertising side. So this is something that we will have to watch very closely. It says add tear rolls out. All right. Nobody let Penn bachelor know that he might not be on the ad supported tier. He might get upset. We know what happens then. Thank so much. Allie Canal. We appreciate it. Switching gears everyone. Investors saying it's a match as dating app specialist match group reported and earnings beat. The company which owns popular services including Tinder, Inge and match.com saw a boost in users and subscriptions in Tinder. That's even as a widening or weakening global economy threatens some of the spending here, particularly from its lower income consumers. But this is notable, especially given how the reopening would certainly thrust a lot of attention towards people who were just looking to get back out. And year over year, that was the construct. How much of the reopening in 2021 in Q3 back then would actually protrude or permeate over into 2022 and remain kind of this normalized level. I guess the only thing I can really add here is this love is not recession proof. I mean really if you've lost a job.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,53,2022-11-02 17:37:53
4660," protrude or permeate over into 2022 and remain kind of this normalized level. I guess the only thing I can really add here is this love is not recession proof. I mean really if you've lost a job recently you don't have money to go spend $200 on a day night. That's how I read this quarter. Yeah, I mean so the company, the last quarter was not great in terms of the earnings in particular and so this reminds me oddly of Intel a little bit where, where basically the company comes out and says we're going to be disciplined on headcount. We're going to be disciplined on expenses and that seems to be in this environment what the street wants to hear. These reassurances that these companies are reading the room so to speak and that they understand that we're going into a tricky time. So that seems to be the sort of big picture here of why match is reacting so well to this report. You wouldn't think that Intel and match would have much in common but that's the theme I see. I'm getting on. I don't think Tinder, I think there was weakness throughout this report. I think they highlighted that really through and through it. They lost customers in some parts of the business. Well for match, for bumble all of them are trying to build up the amount of revenue that they're seeing on each individual user by offering some of the incremental kind of add-on costs whether that's being able to move yourself to the top of somebody's queue, whether that's being able to say just send somebody a gift through the platform which to me is a little creepy. But if that's your, if that's your job, then that's your job. That's what I think. Yeah, I mean the paying users here is what it's going to continue to come down to where they're seeing that that paying user kind of increase. And I think it's really going to come back to as well the amount of word of mouth marketing that actually takes place among those paying users because if some paying users are saying you know what at the end of the day this is not really working for me anyway. Then you could see a deceleration. I mean there's also some internal stuff going on. There's no permanent CEO for Tinder right now. The CEO of that group left earlier in the year and they have not replaced them. And so this is something that they need to work on as well. So they're seeing the revenue strength. They're seeing still paying users keep up. But it's this sort of preparing for maybe things that are not going to be so rosy going down, coming down the pike. Indeed. All right. We're also watching electronic art shares. They're on the move. The video game maker is still confident that consumers will keep gaming despite economic headwinds for more our tech editor Dan Halley joins us. Dan, I think a lot of anticipation for electronic arts. I'm sure ahead of the World Cup they talked a little bit about this on the earnings call last night. Yeah. You know they so let's just go over the numbers real quick. They had missed on earnings per share and revenue and they had seen net bookings that were 100 1.75 billion that's compared with 1.85 billion in the year ago quarter. That is to kind of be expected after this huge explosion that we saw in the gaming industry throughout the pandemic. So there's going to be a drop. The bigger issue here I think for them is what they're expecting for the full fiscal year and they revised those numbers downward. They think that they're going to get between 2.79 and 2.8 billion. Sorry. The expected revenue was supposed to be 7.6 billion to 7.8 billion. It's down 50 million from what they had previously said and then total bookings they're expecting between 7.65 and 7.85 billion. That's down from the 7.9 and 8.1 billion. So they're expecting less spending. They're saying that that's a mix of things including the currency headwinds as well as people may be pulling back. They did yes with the World Cup. They had their largest launch ever for FIFA as far as FIFA 23 goes. They said they had 10.3 million players in its first week which is absolutely huge. They also have other franchises that are continuing to play. There's Apex Legends. People still like that. They did have their latest battlefield title come out which was who boy, absolute stinker. I mean it just was not good. It was broken right out of the gate and they're trying to fix that and you feel bad for the developers to put time into that. But I mean that's just not going anywhere. And going forward they do have some titles coming out. They have, it takes two coming out for the Nintendo Switch. That's more like a friendly like my wife and I would play. It's not something that's going to really drive sales. They have a new D for speed game coming out in December. Not going to be absolutely massive. They have a remake of the game Dead Space but that's coming in January.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,54,2022-11-02 17:41:51
4661," That's something that's going to really drive sales. They have a new D for speed game coming out in December. Not going to be absolutely massive. They have a remake of the game Dead Space, but that's coming in January. So there's some big games. Then you start going into further into 2023. And there's more titles there. There's a new Star Wars game. That tends to do well for them. But there's nothing that I'm really seeing on their upcoming games that really just like is going to knock my socks off. I think their company that they're so heavily reliant on their sports section. And look, people buy Madden every year. And I don't know why. It's a great game. I'm just confused why the stock is up. I think the numbers weren't that exciting. The mobile numbers seemed to be pretty pretty. Yeah, but the forecasts are kind of meh. I don't know. I think it's that the mobile numbers aren't as bad as they could have been. Competition as far as games, this holiday season, is going to be kind of light. The big one coming out is the new God of War game. That's a PlayStation exclusive though. So it's not going to hit on Xbox or anything anytime soon. But it probably is having to do it, the mobile aspect. And then it's not as bad as they thought it could be. But like I said, nothing really here that's going to knock my socks off as far as upcoming titles. It's just Activision Blizzard still has a lot. Take 2 still has. I mean, like Grand Theft Auto 5 is 8 million years old and it's still printing money for them. As you were running through the reception of some of those core titles that many of them being household names, I was looking at some data that came out yesterday, called the Duty Modern Warfare 2, has become the number one selling opening weekend ever in the franchise. $800 million through the first three days from its release on October 28th. With that in mind, what do we expect of this particular holiday season as we were just breaking down where the consumers might be starting to pull back in some spending categories as that, the same in gaming as well? I think gaming, there's always talk about, is it, obviously everything there's talk about, is it recession proof? I think with gaming in particular, the titles may be less to suffer the actual game sales. They are 60 bucks, so maybe people won't be buying as often. But there are sales that are just bonkers now. You wait a month after its title comes out and it goes from $70 to $20. So, I mean, sure that means that the companies aren't doing as well on margin there, but it does mean that the sales are going through. And then the bigger thing is what they have to offer as far as online play. And then that's where your net bookings come in. And that'll start to really blow up for people. I think for Activision Blizzard and Call of Duty, that's another title that just prints money for them. And they're going to have their online game that's, they have the multiplayer aspect going on, but they're going to have Modern Warzone 2, which really blew up at the high of the pandemic, or at the onset of the pandemic. This is the sequel to that. I still play it every Friday, get a couple of white claws and play with my friends. I'm going to keep doing that. So I'll be on there as well. But I think there are some titles that are going to continue to do well. Really, for a lot of companies, they look at the online games and they say, this is a continuing revenue stream. They look at the single-player games and they say, it's not really going to do as well. But then, honestly, on balance, you can look at some of these single-player games and say, oh, they blew everyone else out of the water. So I'm looking at God of War, Ragnarok, and thinking that that could be one of those games. Link up with me on Xbox. Damn, we can do some NBA jam. I can really get it. Baby, I've already got the SNES. We're always on fire. That's what we do. You know the man, gaming expert Dan Healey. Okay, before we go to break, we're watching shares of Disney off Paramounts. Really less than expected earnings. The fairies Tim Nolan is out reiterating an upper form rating on the stock. Head of Disney's November 8th earnings. Nolan thinks Disney plus his plays to show continued upside-down new subscriber additions and slowing operating losses. But he does voice a good bit of caution on the outlet for Disney's theme parks where attendance could be hit in 2023 if the US economy slips into a recession.

Rockwell automation shares down here after the company saw higher earnings and sales in the fourth quarter and issued a fiscal 2023 growth forecast. Let's bring in Rockwell automation chairman and CEO Blake Morett for more on this. Blake, always good to see you. Top of your earnings release. You know that organic sales in the fourth quarter up 20 and a half percent that's very big gain against a backdrop of a slowing economy. Where are those sales coming from? So we saw great sales in the fourth quarter. It was broad based and we serve a wide variety of industrial markets from automotive which had a very good quarter semi conduct.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,56,2022-11-02 17:50:34
4663," broad-based and we serve a wide variety of industrial markets from automotive, which had a very good quarter. Semiconductor, as we're participating in the build-down of capacity there, oil and gas, renewable energy with solar energy, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, a really broad-based across the spectrum. With that kind of broad-based results that you've seen, where do you look across the business and really identify where there is perhaps even still cost management that needs to take place at this point in time? Well, productivity is always a part of what we're doing. Even in a time like this when we're seeing double-digit growth, we saw, as you said, double-digit growth in the last fiscal year, particularly strong in the fourth quarter. And as we go forward into our fiscal year, 23 double-digit growth again, with strong earnings growth as well. Now productivity for us and for our customers always remains in style. A big part of our value proposition is increased efficiency in all of these industries as well as helping them launch new lines of business. And we look inward and look for ways to be efficient ourselves. Blake, I'm trying to figure out why your shares are down, frankly. And I don't know if it was the midpoint of the private forecast, maybe being a little light of what analysts were predicting. But I also see your free cash flow was lower than some of the folks on the street were predicting. And about $358 million. Can you talk to us about your cash position and how you guys are spending and we're saving right now? Sure. We're traditionally a very strong converter of a free cash flow. And one of the things that we see in an environment like this is an increase in our inventory, particularly components work in process. As we're managing through the supply chain constraints, bringing in largely semiconductor chips, they're arriving at different times. And so we're making sure that we're bringing in that inventory so that when that last chip arrives, then we're able to get products out the door and improve the customer service and reduce lead times to customers. The downside of that is that higher inventory is reflected in higher working capital, which has a negative impact on free cash flow. Blake, I mentioned before your organic sales and this four in the fourth quarter, you just completed up 20 and a half percent. But your outlook for the next 12 months, you see organic sales up 9% to 13%. How is this current quarter started? Current quarter has started in line with our expectations. So our quarter began October 1 and so far the quarter in terms of orders and shipments is developing in line with expectations. I want to also mention in an environment like this, there's continued volatility while we expect a gradual improvement in the supply chain and specifically around semiconductor availability for the types of node technologies that we use. We still believe a conservative approach is appropriate as we introduce guide for the year. I'm also curious about whether a conservative approach is warranted on things like headcount. I noticed in the statement, you talked about that you're committed to investing in attracting and retaining key talent. How are you thinking about workforce and headcount right now? Are you sort of holding the line on numbers but still focused on getting the best people in their house that work? Well, we always focus on getting the best people in and obviously making sure that we're an attractive destination for talent in all ways. In compensation is certainly a part of that, increase amounts of equity as a part of total rewards and all the other things that make rock roll a great place to work. With a continued low unemployment, then we recognize that talent, especially in some of the most high demand jobs, have a lot of choices. It's a fundamental part of our culture to consider all the other choices that an employee like a customer can go and to make sure that we match up really well.

Coming up, XPO has officially launched its spin-off RXO. We're going to speak to the New CEO of XPO. Let's come up next. I'm going to start off with a new one. XPO now an independent company after spinning off its truckload brokerage business RXO. And also we've got a new CEO for XPO. That's Mario Harrick and he is joining us now. Mario, full disclosure. You and I chatted a little bit last night at a reception at the NYSE following the formal spin-off here. And we of course have talked to Brad Jacobs who is now stepping down as the CEO of the company about the rationale behind what's going on. But just to take a step back, we have talked so much about the broader economic landscape. We've talked a lot about the build-up that we've seen in inventories and a lot of industries. What are you guys seeing across the country in terms of the flows of goods? We're really towards great seeing you and thanks for having me on. So we are seeing a softer macro this year than what we saw last year. And we're hearing mixed feedback from our customers. Today our less than truckload business is two-third industrial companies.

Finance live this Wednesday, November 2nd, we are moments away from the Fed's decision on interest rates, Wall Street widely expecting a 75 basis point hike. Let's take a look at how the markets are trading ahead of this decision. We have the Dow not too far from the flatline, still low in positive territory. Up though, just 24 points, S&P in the red off just around 3 tens of a percent. We are seeing some selling in the NAS Act.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,58,2022-11-02 17:59:18

We are seeing some selling in the NASDAQ. 106, the NASDAQ 100. That's off about 7 tens of a percent. Some pressure on some of those big techniques. We'll hear about more in just a couple of minutes here. Let's take a look at the bond market. You have the 10 year still in the red. We have the sector action as we head into this decision. Utilities and duchels, financials, health care, the only sectors holding onto gains this afternoon bringing up the rear wave consumer discretionary communication services and technology, the worst performers this afternoon. Michelle. All right. Well, you mentioned those US bond markets. Let's get you up to speed on what's been happening there as we're seeing as with the five year we're seeing that that's down about a third of a percent, the 10 year down about half a percent, the 30 year pulling back the most though down almost 1%. Now let's also take a look at what we're seeing with the two year because that's actually impacted the most by Fed policy expectations and also reflects sentiment about the outlook for the FEDFED funds rate as we take a look at the two year also under pressure here. So one will be keeping a close eye on Dave. Thank you. Michelle. So the next stock is ahead of this decision. Always the most sensitive area to Fed rate increases. Probably part of the reason they are down 31% year to date and part of the reason they are up just less than 2% over that powerful October versus what we saw in the Dow up 13% you see meta Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, alphabet all down on the day ahead of this decision from the Fed. Let's get more from Jen Schomburg ahead of the big decision from Jerome Powell. Jen. Rate hike the fellow reserve raising its short term benchmark interest rate by three quarters of percentage point to a new range of three and three quarters to four percent. Now the Fed laying the table for perhaps a slowdown on future rate hike saying in the statement that determining future rate hikes they will take into account the cumulative effect and the lag and monetary policy on the economy, inflation and financial developments. The Fed is expected to expect ongoing increases in the interest rate until it achieves a level that is, quote, sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back down to that 2% level. Now the Fed still views inflation as high and views the job market as strong, pointed to stop strong job gains in a low unemployment rate. This marks the fourth straight 75 basis point rate hike since June and unprecedented move for the fellow reserve, the Fed has been taking a lot of time to get to the end of the year. It started explicitly targeting the Fed funds rate back in the late 1980s. The vote was unanimous and while the Fed pulled another jumbo rate hike today, we will wait to hear from Fed Chair Powell on whether he will signal slower rate hikes ahead. We'll get more from him and less than 30 minutes time back to you. Jen, the rate hike this afternoon taking rates the highest level that we have. That's just a little bit more than 30 minutes. We'll see how the rate hike is going to be in the next few months. How is the language evolved from the last meeting because a lot of focus from the market perspective is what it's signaling when it comes to December and then out into 2023? Right. So as I mentioned John, the major change in the statement is that they seem to be setting the table for perhaps a slow down in the pace of rate hike. So we're going to determine the path forward for future rate hikes. They're going to take into account the cumulative impact of rate hikes that have already been done as well as that lag effect. Typically there's an 18 month lag effect when it comes to monetary policy. So they're going to take that into account as they look at the impact on the economy, inflation and financial developments. All right. A big thank you there to our very own Jen Sean Buggler. We'll be keeping an eye on you. Don't go ahead and see the next meeting. We'll be looking at the theme. The advices capital management partner and portfolio manager also joining Sarah House Wells-Fygo senior economists. And as we're already seeing the doubt up about 340 points just on that announcement, even though we knew obviously that this was expected. So John, what's your initial reaction to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,59,2022-11-02 18:03:57
4666," Seeing the doubt, about 340 points just on that announcement, even though we knew obviously that this was expected. So, John, what's your initial reaction to this? This was widely baked in at this point. Yeah, no surprise here. And very little changing in the statement that we've seen so far. Clearly, the big news will come with the press conference. I think there was some concession to and recognition of that growth is moderating. And I think that might suggest to the market that the end might be in sight for rate increases. We do expect another rate increase in December, potentially also in March. The Fed does have a really big challenge here trying to get this inflation under control. When there are so many factors that have contributed to it, from rising wages in the tight labor market, we saw some new data on that yesterday, and also from continuing shortages in various parts of the economy. So, the Fed has a hard problem. The market is finally recognizing that it's going to take some time to solve. But they now may be thinking, okay, next year may not be as bad as it could have been with rate increases, at least pedoring out. Sarah, what do you expect to hear from Jerome Powell? So, I expect that we'll still hear that he is utterly determined. She bring down inflation. But I think we'll also hear a little bit of a tone that we've seen in this statement here, and that we're getting to a point where we're at more of a crossroads when it comes to policy. The committee, of course, has already done tremendous tightening to date, so we're raising the Fed fund rate by 375 basis points in just eight months. But we need to take into account how much tightening has been done. So, there's a little bit more new on some thinking in the outlook. But I think it's important to remember that even as the Fed is signaling that it might be ready or might be in a place where it can begin to slow the pace of rate, I think that the committee is far from done for policy tightening. So, and when you take a look at the Dowser action right now, we're up just around 267 points. We wore up over 300 points just a minute to go. S&P in the Green Nasdaq, now back in positive territory, up just around four tenths of a percentth excitement that we're seeing from Wall Street. Is that a bit overdone at this point just given the uncertainty out there and the fact that the Fed is going to keep raising rates, it sounds like? You know, I think the Fed said something that really should have been obvious to everybody that sort of understands how they work is they made an explicit statement that they're going to take into account the cumulative tightening that has already taken place is when they gauge how much more tightening needs to happen. Now, and of course that there will be lags and they would take those lags into account before deciding whether to tighten any further. So, I mean, that should have been obvious to people, but I think that came as perhaps some reassurance to the market and remember where we are. I mean, the market, the S&P 500, the Dow, the Nasdaq certainly has already traded off significantly when you think about the rate increases that were signaled starting about a year ago. And I think investors, particularly long-term investors, are looking forward and they're saying, hey, stocks have become pretty inexpensive here. At some point, these rate increases are going to cease and in fact, we have more rate increases behind us than we have in front of us so that rate increase headwind, particularly to growth stocks, is now going to be tapering off at potentially reversing as we get into the second half of next year. So, it's a good time potentially to buy some stocks if you're a longer-term investor. And Sarah, we did see some of the balance sheet tightening start to slow in June. How much of an indicator, though, is that of how far away we might be from the Fed perhaps plateauing or at least pivoting at some point? So, I think we're still some ways in terms of reaching that terminal rate. So right now, our expectation is that we will continue to see the Fed hiking through probably the March meeting, but I think we have to also acknowledge that inflation is quite stubborn right now and so we're still expecting poor PC inflation to be running a little bit under 4% amulet through the first half of the year. And so, I think that's going to keep the Fed on guard when it comes to its policy stance. So still looking at a pretty tight stance of policy. And it's also not just about how far the Fed ultimately takes the Fed funds rate, but I think we also have to bear in mind how long the Fed will keep that policy rate at such an elevated height. And Joe, as important as this day is, it's hard not to look ahead to Thursday with the CPI number. That's next Thursday. If you're Jerome Powell, what can you point to if you want to say, all right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,60,2022-11-02 18:07:52
4667," or a target, you know, after they've now cleared out their inventories and stocked the right stuff, they could be real opportunities and we like those two stocks particularly. And then you have to look at the luxury brands. Some of them continuing to do well. You have to watch the inventory situation. But the high end consumer really isn't going to feel the pinch so much from this inflation. Gas, foods, a small proportion of their budget expenditure so that they're not going to be hurt that much. So really is a time to pick and choose where to go. Favorite the luxury consumer retail markets and really stay away from the mid range where folks are, you know, companies are likely to see us fall off in their traffic as folks go bargain, shopping at a place like TJ Maxx. All right. Joanne and Sarah stick around because we're going to be coming back to you in just a later on this half hour. Let's bring in Dennis Lockhart. He's a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta getting his take on the 75 basis point height that we just got from the Fed and Dennis. I want to start here because the Fed is laying out this possible rationale for a slowdown in the pace of rate. I'm saying that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range of committee is going to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lives with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. I know you were specifically watching the language here, the change that we could potentially hear from the Fed. What's your takeaway on that statement? Well, I'm not surprised at today's rate move. I think that was everybody expected that. I am a little surprised at the inclusion in the statement of language that gives some hint of what the path of policy might be. That's a little bit unusual. I think it's welcome because they're acknowledging that they're they're getting close to a restrictive point and at some stage will be looking a lot more tactically at whether to add further rate rises or to pause. They're signaling that they're getting into that zone and I think that's a good thing. Of course, they want to keep their options open as much as possible. So Dennis, based on that, another evidence you're taking into account, you expect 50 next month. If you're not going to pause in 23 or keep hiking. Depends on the data, of course, and we can't forget that. They're always going to be looking at the data and looking for for some signs of progress against the inflation problem. I think it's quite plausible that they stepped down to 50 next month. I would even say that's likely. And they have a meeting January 31st and February 1st and another meeting in March. I think it's a little early to project those rate hikes if they actually occur because it's going to depend on all the inflation reports and analysis they do between now and then. And Dennis, they did say they would take into account cumulative, cumulative tightening as well as some of the lags that people are concerned about in the real economy showing up. The thing is that they're keeping that in mind. And this was a unanimous decision. Are you surprised because we were hearing a little bit of dissent as to how far and how far the Fed should be going right now? Well, let's remember that the vote, the list of voters is a subset of the total committee. And so a unanimous decision on the 75 basis point increase doesn't necessarily reflect that there isn't a fairly robust debate during the meeting among those who think we should slow down and those who think they should they should keep at it. Perhaps raise 75 next meeting or even thereafter. So you just don't know what the discussion is. The minutes that come out in three weeks will give us a much better sense of that. But I'm not surprised that it was unanimous. I don't think anyone had a basis on which to dissent at this meeting. Dennis, two questions, Jerry. Even in this room before, I know we've asked you this in the past, but at this point in the economic cycle, when there's so much uncertainty, when we do have five inflation prints between now and the next Fed decision, what kind of conversations do you think are going on inside the Fed? And when you take a look at inflation right now, signs that they could potentially",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,61,2022-11-02 18:15:22
4668," between now and the next Fed decision. What kind of conversations do you think are going on inside the Fed? And when you take a look at inflation right now, signs that it could potentially be cooling. How confident are you that we will see significant cooling here in the coming months? Well, I tell you, I have been surprised at how persistent the inflation picture has been so far. I think it's very hard to conclude that inflation in any way is really broken to the downside, broken out to the downside. It is still a very troublesome picture when you take all of the different components into effect or into consideration. Your earlier speaker correctly said autos seem to be softening perhaps shelter and housing is softening but it's still a little bit early to draw that conclusion. I think they will be talking among themselves about messaging and that is if they decide to step down, how do they frame that decision exactly? And it's a little bit of a tricky communication problem, I think, for Jay Powell and for his colleagues. Earlier this week's BlackRock is out with the notes saying we think the Fed will only stop when the severe damage from rate hikes is clear to you fear severe damage and if so, where would we see it? I've been saying now for many weeks that the more persistent inflation is the greater the chances or probability of a recession simply because they have one crude tool that they're using. It doesn't address every root cause of inflation and if inflation continues they're going to be highly tempted to continue to use that tool. So the risk of overshooting or oversteering is very definitely there and I just think that you have to consider the possibility of a recession of some severity, I'm not sure what severity in 2023. And we know that Chair Powell had talked about pain for the US consumer for the everyday American with this. For people who are wondering what this means for their credit card bills, how should they be bracing themselves for this period? I spoke yesterday to someone from the retail industry who gave me a sense that the consumer is already adjusting to some extent and that most of the spending in this particular chain of stores is on essentials, not on discretionary items. And I think that's probably what's happening. The overall consumer numbers are holding up but the constitution of consumption is shifting to essentials and I think you're going to see particularly those at the lower end of the income spectrum doing that more and more and with more and more difficulty, frankly, if essentials continue to rise in price. This is your reaction to the market's reaction to this and I know you're more of an economy guy, not so much an equity person but when you take a look at the euphoria that we continue to see in the markets when the Fed is still saying that they're going to raise rates and just might not be as aggressive. Do you think a move like this is justified? Now we'll see if it holds for the next couple of market sessions but I think what you're seeing right now and then the Dow is up with 202 points. It's sort of a sigh of relief many rally after a lot of suspense building up. They're not so much suspense but let's say just building up to the decision and the announcement by the Fed and I think what the Fed has done today as well as said sort of confirms the expectations that were already priced into the market and the market is responding positively to having their expectations affirmed. The markets are walking through a desert surgeon for any hope that there might be water on the horizon aren't they Dennis Lockhart. Great to have you here sir appreciate that. Thank you.

Good to see you sir. Let's first get your reaction. We knew the 75 was coming. Anything inside the language surprise you in particular the mention of the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. Well, I thank you and all the prior guests who just spoke before me are focusing on the right things. That the addition of that language elevated the importance of the idea that when you get closer and closer to a destination you slow down just like when you're driving a car. And that's what they're telling us the the the the acknowledgement of the lags the cumulative tightening that's in the pipeline. The signal is clear they're getting closer to their pause. It'll probably be early to mid 2023 call it 475 or 5 and then they have to stop and wait to see the cumulative impact of the tightening the fact that the bond market is reacting with the steepening where two and five or yields or double digits richer. And that makes some sense. This new language I think for closes at least for now. The concern that they're going to keep going 75 and I think it affirms expectations that were built off of recent FOMC members speeches and appearances that this day was coming. This idea of slowing the pace and getting closer to the pause. When we're getting closer to a destination I'm looking down at my GPS and I'm seeing the time go down 10 minutes or so we're not seeing that in inflation. We're still at a 40 year high. What evidence in there is there that we are closer to the destination, which is 2% I'm going to stay with the car analogy. If you are going to drive your car by looking solely in your rearview mirror, you will hit a wall or another car. That's what the Fed would be doing if they looked solely at CPI and PCE realized past inflation while driving the car of monetary policy is the economy moves forward. They need to look forward and anticipate it's undeniably clear that monetary policy is not instantaneous mortgage rates have surged but other interest rate sensitive sectors are only now starting to feel the pain cumulative impact of a sharp and aggressive tightening that is already underway. They need to look through the windshield as to where the car is going. Lags take time to overcome. We cannot set policy solely on realized past inflation. The Fed is heartened by the way by the fact that inflation expectations are all pretty much south of 3% whether you look at tips or you look at surveys. They are acting in a manner that keeps those expectations relatively contained and they can't set policy solely on realized inflation. It's like driving a car looking solely in the rearview mirror. In terms of what we saw with Q3 real GDP, we know that the Fed is data dependent but with so many indicators pointing in different directions. What does this mean for not just the likelihood of a recession but how deep of a recession we might be headed for? Q3 GDP was an upside surprise propelled heavily by the surge in exports and the drop in imports. The post pandemic world has been dominated by heterogeneous reopenings, all kinds of distortions to global trade patterns. Who actually thinks exports are going to keep growing in a double digit rate? Very few people. The economy is slowing in China. The economy is likely going to be in a recession in Europe. Global growth is slowing. Our exports are not going to continue to expand that pace. If you ex out the impact of trade and government spending from the Q3 GDP release we just had, it was 0.1% at an annual rate, a seasonally adjusted annual rate, 0.1. That wasn't that strong of a GDP print. The underlying internals when you ex out traded particular as well as government spending are weaker. The midterms are coming up. Government spending is not going to be surprising to the upside when we have divided government with Republicans controlling perhaps the House and the Senate. Certainly the House. The markets are not waiting for the press conference just in terms of how they are interpreting this additional sentence that was put into the statement. But when we look ahead to that press conference from Fed Chair Jay Powell, what are you hoping to hear?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,63,2022-11-02 18:23:57
4670," waiting for the press conference just in terms of how they are interpreting this additional sentence that was put into the statement But when we look ahead to that press conference from Fed Chair Jay Powell, what are you hoping to hear? What will you be listening for over the next 45 minutes or so? The new language that that we've all been talking about is going to get questions from from the media that's assembled in the room there. They they're going to want to drill down for further meaning there. It's a challenge. The chairman Powell faces getting in front of them at any session, but he actually has a unique challenge now. This language, which I think was unanimous across all the voters, suggests that they're opening the doors of the pause. It's not right away, but they're getting close. We're getting close to our destination, as I said before. There's going to be a lot of questions about how the market should interpret that new language. Why was it put in there? Clearly the committee on a unanimous basis feels like it belongs there. Can Chairman Powell still sound hawkish on inflation while acknowledging the need for a pause and not open the door to a huge rally? Former President Law card mentioned earlier. It's a tough act. It's not an easy task to communicate such subtleties to the markets which often trade on soundbites. So there's a risk that he gets up there and tries to talk back or walk back the language in the statement. That seems like a low risk. I think he may elaborate on it in a way that will get further bullish response from potentially equities and from the intermediate part of the Treasury curve, for example. So then RJ, on behalf of investors, if you were in that room with Jay Powell, what would you want to ask him? Interestingly enough, I think that the bigger questions come down to quantitative tightening. The Fed's plans with respect to the balance sheet. They've made their pace of balance sheet reduction abundantly clear. But there's plenty of talk, including talk at the Treasury Department of the need to sort of bolster liquidity. Bond volatility both implied and realized volatility has been extraordinarily high this year and liquidity conditions have likely something to do with that. I'd be interested to see what Fed staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York working with the Treasury. What they're thinking about, what measures could be taken to allow the balance sheet to shrink to be consistent with the overall monetary tightening. But to do so in a way that might be less disruptive to the functioning of the marketplace. RJ, Galah, always great to have you. Federated her knees. A senior portfolio manager. Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. Let's kick it over to Jared Bickery. Is there closer look at some of those gains that we're seeing at least across the board when it comes to equity markets? Yes, and don't call it a pivot. Some great commentary there. And I'm going to delve deeper into this, but I just want to point out the Dow S&P 500 NASDAQ all in the green now, not the case earlier in the day. And I just want to go over some of the movements in the bond market. Here's a five year TNO yield. It is net down nine basis points. You're going to see everything down on their yield curve. Ten year TNO yield. That's down five basis points. And the 30 year on the long end down a little bit less, three basis points. The very short end down three basis points. You can see the 13 week. That tracks what the Fed benchmark is doing. The very short as end. And it has recovered somewhat. Also, the US dollar very important. That has taken a leg lower. But you got to think all of this was set up by that Timorouse article in the Wall Street Journal about two weeks ago. And there's a lot of pressure on Fed share Powell right now. Is he going to deliver what he doesn't want? Is that going to be a stock market rally? The Fed officials have been on record saying that's not what they want to see in this instance. So I have to agree with our prior, I guess. It's going to be a very difficult tight wire act for Jay Powell to navigate here. As he takes questions and isn't too bullish or optimistic, I guess we're going to have to apply the Goldilocks test with 2020 hindsight. Paradise. Has to be just right indeed. Jeroblicery, thank you so much. All right, well, as we wait comments from Fed share Jerome Powell, let's bring back to Anthony, advice as capital management partner and portfolio manager. And Sarah House Wells Fargo, senior economist. So Sarah, obviously we're seeing increased market reaction here. But obviously we're still waiting for the exact wording to come from Fed share Jerome Powell. Just how tough is this balancing act going to be in terms of the wording of this? Well, I think it's still going to be very tough because I think he's going to want to demonstrate that the committee is still very much committed to bringing inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,64,2022-11-02 18:28:18
4671," learning of this. I think it's still going to be very tough because I think he's going to want to demonstrate that the committee is still very much committed to bringing inflation down restoring inflation back towards its target, but also acknowledging the fact it's done a lot of tight need to date. It's time for things to slow, but they haven't given up on that inflation target. So as some of the prior guests mentioned, I think it's going to be difficult to make sure that the market maybe doesn't run away with that somewhat more dovish message than that has been signaling over the past few months, but balancing it with the fact that yes, there's been a lot of tightening to date. There's still a lot of work to do when it comes to inflation. And Joanne, perhaps Lloyd Blankfine, the former chairman of Goldman tweeted it best, I imagine Jay Powell and the rest of Fed governors are right now sitting with the Thessauris trying to find the right word that means pause or not pause depending on whose listening. So what's the language you'll be listening for? What's the Fed drinking game coffee, if you will? Is it data dependent? Yeah, you know, who knows what Thessauris they're using, but data dependent is a term I'm sure we will hear again. I think they will get into specifics to try to create that balance. One area is to be clear that house prices went up a lot, rents is up a lot. That's going to feed into keeping inflation on inflation. The labor market remains tight. They could cite the recent data on that. On the other hand, they are also likely to cite data that shows that the economy is slowing a bit, whether that comes from the liquidity constraints that we are starting to see pop up in corporate debt markets government debt markets. We're seeing credit spreads widened. We're seeing bid aspects wide in. So there's clearly liquidity constraint that should tamp down some of the economic growth that we've been seeing. They can cite that as the other side that their policies are having an effect, but that they need to do more that there's definitely more work to do given the pressure on wages given the housing data. And so I think they'll have enough data in their arsenal to be able to strike that balance. I think they'll try to emphasize right that they are data dependent and that looking at inflation in the past, you know, is only part of the data that they use. That they're doing a lot of observation of the economy in real time to gauge how much more work they have to do. And if you again, you look from an investing perspective, I think it's pretty clear there are fewer rate increases to come. Then we've had to date and that suggests a little bit of less of a headwind to stock valuations going forward from here. And I think that's partly what the market is reacting to. And so in addition to the inflation data, obviously the CPI prints and the five prints that we're going to be getting out between now and the next meeting is going to be a big focus. What else in addition to jobs will you be focusing on over the next four weeks. I think the same as you are spending in addition to just the labor market and inflation data. So we've seen weakness in business investment. You've seen weakness in residential investment. And as RJ was talking about, we can't see the strength and exports go on forever, but how the household sector does. How willing it is to spend down the savings, lean on its balance sheets. I think we'll be pivotal, pivotal for how long we can see the economy continue to expand and continue to put pressure on inflation. All right. There is the Fed chair Jerome Powell walking the podium. Let's listen. Good afternoon. My colleagues and I are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal. We have both the tools that we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 75 basis points and we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate. Our policy stands purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%. In addition, we're continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price stability will likely require maintenance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,65,2022-11-02 18:32:39
4672," In addition, we're continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance of policy for some time. I will have more to say about today's monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. The U.S. economy has slowed significantly from last year's rapid pace. Real GDP rose at a pace of 2.6% last quarter, but is unchanged so far this year. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this quarter. Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year's rapid pace in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions. Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business-fixed investment. Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low. Job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month over August and September. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs, and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year. Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2%. Over the 12-month ending in September, total PCE prices rose 6.2%, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5.1%. And the recent inflation data again have come in higher than expected. Price pressures remained evident across a broad range of goods and services. Russia's war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food, and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. But that is not grounds for complacency. The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, and as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, economic food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. At today's meeting, the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points. Continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. With today's action, we've raised interest rates by 3 and 3-quarters percentage points this year. We anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2% over time. Financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions, and we are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest rates sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. That's why we say in our statement that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, we will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. At some point, as I've said in the last two press conferences, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,66,2022-11-02 18:36:53
4673," At some point, as I've said in the last two press conferences, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases, as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% goal. There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates. Even so, we still have some ways to go, and incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected. Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices in the longer run. The historical record caution strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Colby. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. On the need to slow the pace of rate increases at some point. Is a downshift contingent on a string of better inflation data specifically between now and let's say the December meeting? Is that something that the Fed could potentially proceed with independent of that data given the lag defects that you mentioned? So a couple of things on that. We do need to see inflation coming down decisively and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings. Of course that's what we'd all love to see. But that's, I've never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we're aiming for. We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% objective over the medium term. How will we know that we've reached that level? Well, we'll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened the effects of that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation. Taking into consideration lags, as I mentioned. We will be looking at real rates, for example, all across the yield curve and all other financial conditions. And as we make that assessment. Hi, Howard Schneider with with Reuters. Look, I'm sure there's going to be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you're going to slow in December or not. Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis point increase? So what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program if I may and hit to talk about the statement language along the way. So I think you can think about our tightening program has really addressing three questions. The first of which was and has been how fast to go. The second is how high to raise our policy rate and the third will be eventually how long to remain at a restrictive level. On the first question, how fast to tighten policy. It's been very important that we move expeditiously and we have clearly done so. We've moved three and three quarters percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero. It's a historically fast pace and that's certainly appropriate given the persistence and strength and inflation and the low level from which we started. So now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate. And we're saying that we'd raise that rate to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2% target over time. And we put that into our post-mating statement because that really does become the important.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,67,2022-11-02 18:41:19
4674, restrictive to bring inflation to our 2% target over time and we put that into our post meeting statement because that really does become the important question we think now is how far to go and I'll talk more about that. We think there's some ground to cover but before we meet that test and that's why we say that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate and as I mentioned incoming data between the meetings both the strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report do suggest to me that we may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting. That level is very uncertain though and I would say you know we're going to find it over time. Of course with the lags between policy and economic activity there's a lot of uncertainty so we note that in determining the pace of future increases we'll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with the monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. So I would say as we come closer to that level move more into restrictive territory the question of speed becomes less important than the second third questions and that's why I've said it the last two press conferences that at some point it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made it is likely we'll have a discussion about this at the next meeting a discussion. To be clear let me say again the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high deraise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted which really will be our principal focus. If I could follow up on that to what degree was there an importance or wait given to a need to signal this possibility now given all the concerns really around the globe about fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else you know dealing with their own stress as a result. Well I think I'm pleased that we have moved as fast as we have I don't think we've over tightened. I think there's very difficult to make a case that that our current level is too tight given that inflation still runs well above the federal funds rate. So I think that at this meeting I think the last two meetings as I've mentioned I've said that we that there would come a point and this was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might mean and we did discuss this and as I mentioned we'll discuss it again in December. But there's no I don't have any sense that we've over tightened or moved too fast. I think I think it's been good in a successful program we we we uh that we've gotten this far this fast remember though that that uh we we still think there's a need for ongoing rate increases and um we have some ground left to cover here and uh and and cover it we will. Nick Temeros of the Wall Street Journal chair Powell core BCE inflation on a three or six month annualized basis and on a 12 month basis has been running uh in the high fours close to 5% is there any reason to think you won't have to raise rates at least above that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down. So this is the question of disdison does the policy rate need need to get above the inflation rate and I would say they're range of views on that that's the classic Taylor principle view but I I would think you'd look more at a forward uh you know a forward looking um uh measure of of inflation to to to look at that but um I think the answer is we'll want to get the uh the policy rate to a level where it is where the where the real interest rate is positive. We will want to do that. I do not think of it as the as the single and only touchstone though. I think you put some weight on that you also put some weight on rates across the curve very few people borrow at the at the short end of the at the federal funds rate for example. So households and businesses if they're they're very you know meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them credit spread spreads are are larger so barring rates are significantly higher um and uh I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit so I would look at that as an important feature I put some,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,68,2022-11-02 18:45:36
4675," are larger so barring rates are significantly higher. And I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit. So I would look at that as an important feature. I'd put some weight on it, but I wouldn't say it's something that is the single dominant thing to look at. If I could follow up, what is your best assessment or the staff's best assessment right now of the current rate of underlying inflation? I don't have a specific number for you there. There are many, many models that look at that. And I mean, one way to look at it is that it's a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs above that level, for sure, substantially above for some time, you'll see it move up. But the movement will be fairly gradual. So I think that's what the principal models would tend to say. But I wouldn't want to land on any one assessment. There are many different, as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation. Thank you. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Gina Smiley with New York Times. I wonder, do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is or is it risk of becoming entrenched? Is inflation becoming entrenched? So I guess I would start by pointing to expectations. So if we saw longer term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling. And they were moving up a little bit in the middle part of this year, and they've moved now back down. That's one piece of data. Shorter term inflation expectations moved up between the last meeting and this meeting. And we don't think those are as indicative, but they may be important in the wage setting process. There's a school of thought that believes that. So that's very concerning. I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have, we're now 18 months into this episode of high inflation. And we don't have a clearly identified scientific way of understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. And so the thing we need to do from a risk management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully, but thoughtfully, and get inflation under control, get it down to 2% get it behind us. That's what we really need to do, and what we're strongly committed to doing. Rachel. Hi, Terpowell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. The statement points to the lag times. I'm wondering if you can walk us through how you judge those lag effects, what that timeline looks like over the coming months or even a year, and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the economy. Yeah. So the way I would think about that is it's a commonly for a long time thought that monetary policy works with long and variable legs, and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity, and then perhaps later than that even on inflation. So that's been the thinking for a long time. There was an old literature that made those legs out to be fairly long. There's newer literature that says that they're shorter. And the truth is we don't have a lot of data of inflation of this high in what is now the minor economy. One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal funds rate, financial conditions would react, and then that would affect economic activity inflation. Now, financial conditions react well before in expectation of monetary policy. That's the way it is moved for a quarter of a century, in the direction of financial conditions, then monetary policy because the markets are thinking what is the central bank going to do. And there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before. We don't know that. I guess the thing I would say is it's highly uncertain. Highly uncertain. And so from risk management standpoint, we do need, it would be irresponsible not to ignore them, but you want to consider them, but not take them literally. So I think it's a very difficult place to be, but I would tend to be, want to be in the middle, looking carefully at what's actually happening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk management standpoint, remembering, of course, that if we were to over.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,69,2022-11-02 18:50:04
4676," It's actually happening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk management standpoint. Remembering, of course, that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy. Whereas if we don't get inflation under control because we know it's tight enough, now we're in a situation where inflation will become entrenched. And the cost, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially. So from a risk management standpoint, we want to be sure that we don't make the mistake of either failing to tighten enough or loosening policy too soon. And if I could follow up, should we interpret the addition to the statement to mean that more weight is put into those lag effects than they would have been after previous rate heights? So I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these ongoing rate heights and policy becomes more restrictive, it'll be appropriate now to be thinking more about lag. Of course, we think about the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy, but we will be thinking about them. But we won't be, I think we'll be considering them, but because it's appropriate to do so. Let me say this, it is very premature to be thinking about pausing. So when they hear lags, they think about a pausage. It's very premature, in my view, to think about or be talking about pausing our rate height. We have a ways to go. Our policy, we need ongoing rate heights to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive. And of course, we don't really know exactly where that is. We have a sense, and we'll write down in September, sorry, in the December meeting, a new summary of economic projections, which updates that. But I would expect us to continue to update it based on what we're seeing with incoming data. Thanks, Neil. Thanks, Chair Powell and Neil Irwin-Vaxios. As you look around the economy, the clearest impact of your tightening so far has been on pausing, maybe some venture fund attack companies. It's been relatively narrow in terms of labor market, consumer demand, a lot of sectors, you don't see a ton of effect. Is the pathway and channels through monetary policy works changing? Is it narrower than it used to be? And on housing in particular, are you at all worried that you're crimping housing supply in ways that might cause problems down the road? I don't know that the channels through which policy works have changed that much. I would say a big channel is the labor market and the labor market is very, very strong. And household, of course, have strong balance sheets. So we go into this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through many different things and also with households who have strong spending power built up. So it may take time. It may take resolve. It may take patience. It's likely to get inflation down. It may, I think you see from our forecast and others that it will take some time for inflation to come down. It'll take time, we think. So sorry, was that getting to your question there? Housing. Housing, the housing part of it. Yeah. We look at housing, of course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the global financial crisis. They're not historically high, but they're much higher than they've been. And you're seeing housing activity decline. You're seeing housing prices growing at a faster rate and in some parts of the country declining. You know, I would say housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic, as demand increased in rates were low. We all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was. Prices going up, many, many bidders, no conditions, that kind of thing. So the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. We're well aware of what's going on there. You know, from a financial stability standpoint, we didn't see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the global financial crisis. This credit was very carefully, much more carefully managed by the lenders.

But no, we do understand that that's really where a very big effect of our policies is. Presentation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,70,2022-11-02 18:54:28
4677," But no, we do understand that that's really where a very big effect of our policies is. Victoria. Hi, Victoria Aguida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the labor market. You mentioned early on again that job openings are very high compared to available workers. And I'm just curious to what extent you do and don't draw a signal from that. So, for example, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to take up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings? What do you see? Are wages what's really important? How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation? So we talk a lot about vacancies and the vacancy to unemployed rate, but it's just one. It's just another data series. It's been, you know, unusually important in this cycle because it's been so out of line, but so has quits, so have wages. So we look at, you know, a very wide range of data on the labor market. So, you know, I'd start with unemployment, which is typically the single statistic you would look to is at a 50-year low, 3.5%. We're getting really nothing in labor supply now. We had, I think, very small increase this year, which we had really thought we thought we would get that back. Most analysts thought we would get some labor supply coming in. You mentioned wages. So I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture. It's true with average hourly earnings, you see. So I would call it a flattening out at a level that's well above the level that would be consistent over time with 2% inflation, you know, assuming a reasonable productivity. With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture. The headline number was a disappointment. Let's just say it was high. It didn't show a decline. There's some raise of light inside that, you know, that if you look at private sector workers, that did come down. The compensation did come down. But overall though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor market where demand substantially exceeds supply. Job creation still exceeds, you know, the sort of the level that would hold the market where it is. So that's a picture. Do we see, you know, we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is happening. You know, maybe that's there, but it's not obvious to me because wages aren't coming down. They're just moving sideways at an elevated level, both ECI and hourly earnings. We would love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down. vacancies are below their all time high, but you know, not by as much as we thought because, you know, the data series is volatile. We never take any one reading. We always look at, you know, two or three. So it's a mixed picture. I don't see the case for real softening just yet. But we look at, I guess I just, as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on labor market. So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation? You know, I think wages have an effect on inflation. And inflation has an effect on wages. I think that's always been the case. There's always a going back and forth. The question is, is that really elevated right now? I don't think so. I don't think wages are the principal story of why prices are going up. I don't think that. I also don't think that we see a wage price spiral. But again, it's not something you can, you know, once you see it, you're in trouble. So we don't want to see it. We want wages to go up. We just want them to go up at a level that's sustainable and consistent with 2% inflation. And, you know, we think we can, we do think that given the, you know, given the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as history would indicate through the unemployment channel. It can soften through job openings declining. We think there's, there's a room for that. But, you know, we won't know that. That'll be, that'll be discovered empirically. Thank you so much, Kayla Towsie from CNBC. Earlier last month, the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession if central banks didn't change course, the new UK Prime Minister warned of a profound economic crisis there.

4678," Central Banks didn't change course, the new UK Prime Minister warned of a profound economic crisis there. And I'm wondering how the Fed is weighing international developments in light of a very strong economy here in the U.S. that would seem to be bucking those trends. So, of course, we keep close tabs on economic developments and also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad. We're in very frequent contact with our foreign counterparts, both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central banks that we have and I have won this weekend with many, many central bankers. So, we're in touch with all of that. I guess it's clear a time, difficult time in the global economy. We're seeing very high inflation in Europe significantly because of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine. And we're seeing China's having issues with the zero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we're used to seeing. We're seeing, we see those difficulties, the strong dollar is a challenge for some countries. But, you know, we take all of that into account in our models. We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing. Here in the United States, we have a strong economy and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5%. Core PCE inflation, which is a really good indicator of what's going on for us, is the way we see it, is running at 5.1% on a 12-month basis. And sort of similar to that on a 36- and 9-month basis. So, we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation of a control. The world's not going to be better off if we fail to do that. That's a task we need to do. Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time. And the stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy for decades, hopefully. Even though it may be difficult to get it back, getting it back is something that provides value to the people we serve for the long run. If I could just follow up on that. Thank you. The Fed has acknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don't affect things like energy and food prices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas. And there are some of the biggest pain points for consumers. So, as you pursue the current path that you've outlined, is there a risk that some of those prices simply don't come down? So, we don't directly affect, for the most part, food and energy prices, but the demand channel does affect them just at the margin. The thing about the United States is that we also have strong, in many other jurisdictions, the principle problem really is energy. In the United States, we also have a demand issue. We've got an imbalance between demand and supply, which you see in many parts of the economy. So, our tools are well suited to work on that problem, and that's what we're doing. You're right, though. The price of oil is set globally, and it's not something we can affect. I think by the actions that we take, though, we help keep longer term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2% inflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high. I don't know. Hi, Chair Powell, Janelle Marty with Bloomberg. So, the Fed is facing two more ethics-related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from President Bostic and President Bullard speaking at a closed event. So, some senators, like Elizabeth Warren, are saying that this is a sign of greater ethics problems at the Fed. Could you talk about what this does to the public's trust in the bank, and what the Fed is doing to prevent this kind of behavior from becoming common? Sure. So, you're right. The public's trust is really the Fed's and any central bank's most important asset, and any time one of us, one of the policy makers, violates or fall short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust, and we take that very seriously. We do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,72,2022-11-02 19:03:00
4679," And anytime one of us, one of the policy makers, violates or fall short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust. And we take that very seriously, we do. So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday, actually, we had a committee discussion of the full committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that's set out in our existing rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications. And we've taken a number of steps and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are. I would say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running and actually was through that, that the problems with President Basis' disclosures were discovered when he filed his new disclosures. We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into disclosures and follows them and approves people's disclosures and also all of their trades. Any trade anyone has to make, who's covered, has to be approved pre-approved. And there's a lag. It has to be pre-approved 45 days before it happens. So there's no ability to game market. So it's a really good system. It worked here. And I think we all said to each other yesterday, actually yesterday morning, we recommitted to each other into this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems. Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending? I don't. So as you know, I referred the matter concerning President Bostic to the Inspector General. Once that happens, I don't discuss it with Inspector General with anybody. It's just the Inspector General has the ability to do investigations. We don't really have that. So that's what he's doing. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Earlier this year, you touted the three month bill yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100% explanatory power. And you said, quote, if it's inverted, that means the fed's going to cut, which means the economy is weak. That curve is only two basis points away from inversion now. So I'm wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened, particularly given that rates work with a leg? Well, so we do monitor the near term forward spread. You're right. And that's been our preferred measure. We think it, you know, just empirically it dominates the ones that people tend to look at, which is twos, tans, and things like that. So it's not inverted. And also you have to look at why things, you know, why the rate curve is doing what it's doing. It can be doing that because it affects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down. In this case, if you're in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that's going to affect the forward curve. So yes, we monitor it. You're right. And that's what I would say. If I could follow up, you also said several meetings ago that the risk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much. Is what you're trying to tell us today is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit? Well, what's happened is time has passed and we've raised interest rates by 375 basis points. I would not, I would not change a word in that statement though. I think until we get inflation down, you'll be hearing that from me. Again, if we overtighten and we don't want to, you know, we want to get this exactly right. But if we overtighten, then we have the ability with our tools which are powerful to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode, we can support economic activity strongly if that happens, if that's necessary. On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it's a year or two down the road and you're realizing inflation behaving the way it can, you're realizing you didn't actually get it. You have to go back in. By then, the risk really is that it has become entrenched in people's thinking and the record is that the employment costs, the cost to the people that we don't want to hurt, they go up with the passage of time. That's really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,73,2022-11-02 19:07:20
4680," And the record is that the employment costs, the cost to the people that we don't want to hurt, you know, they go up with the passage of time. That's really how I look at it. So that isn't going to change. What has changed though, you're right. We're farther along now. And I think as we're farther along, we're now focused on that, you know, what's the place, what's the level we need to get to rates. And you know, I don't know what we'll do when we get there, by the way. You know, it doesn't, we'll have to see. There's been no decision or discussion around exactly what steps we would take at that point. But the first thing is to find your way there. Thanks Chris. We're getting there. Thank you. Chris Ruggabur, an associated press. Just to go back to housing for a minute, you mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on housing. Home sales are down 25% in the past year and so forth. But none of this is really showing up as you know in the government's inflation measures. And as we go forward, private real-time data is clearly showing these hits to housing. Are you going to need to put a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there's overtightening going on? Or will you still focus as much on the more lagging government indicators? So this is an interesting subject. So I start by saying I guess that the measure that's in the CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases. And that makes sense actually because for that reason, that conceptually, that is that's sort of the right target for monetary policy. And the same thing is true for owners equivalent rent, which comes off of, it's a re-weighting of tenant rents. The private measures are of course good at picking up the, you know, at the margin, the new leases. And you know, they tell you a couple things. One thing is once you, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases, it was, it's very prosyclical. So rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did and now they're coming down faster. So what, but what you, the implication is that we, there are still as people, as, as, as non new leases roll over and become and expire, right? You still, there's still in the pipeline, there's still some significant rate increases coming. Okay, but at some point, once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you that what they're telling you is there will come a point at which, which rent inflation will start to come down, but that point is, is well out from where we are now. So we're well aware of that, of course, and we look at it. And we, you know, but I would say that in terms of what the right way to think about inflation really is to look at the, at the measure that we do look at, but, but considering that we also know that, that at some point, you'll see rents coming down. Great, and just a quick follow, it looks like stock and bond markets are reacting positively to your announcements so far. Is that something you would wanted to see is that a problem or what, how much that might affect your future policy to see this positive reaction? You know, we're not, we're not targeting any, anyone or two particular things. You know, our message should be, what I'm trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go. We have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive. And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step. And that's meant to put that question really as the important one now going forward. I've also said that we think that the level of rates that we, we estimated in September, the incoming data suggests that that's actually going to be higher. And that's been the pattern. I mean, I would have little confidence that the forecast, if we made a forecast today, if we were doing an SCP today, you know, the pattern has been that one after another, they go up and, you know, that'll end when it ends. But there's no sense that, that, you know, that inflation is, is coming down to just, if you look at the, I have a table of the, the last 12 months of 12 month readings. And there's really no pattern there. We're exactly where we were a year ago. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,74,2022-11-02 19:11:41
4681," If you look at the I have a table of the the last 12 months of 12 month readings and there's really no pattern there We're exactly where we were a year ago. So Okay, so I would also say It's premature to discuss pausing And it's not something that we're thinking about that's that's really not a conversation to be had now We have what we have a ways to go and the last thing I'll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done and to not making the mistake of Of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and Doing that too soon. So those I control those messages and and that's my job Edward Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. Thank you Chairman So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve is trying to do to get inflation back to the 2% target? You know in theory it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep spending Uh Even and so so I think those two things do tend to wage to sort of counter balance each other out It appears consumer spending is is still positive. It's at pretty modest growth levels It's not shrinking, but and you know people are and you know the banks that deal with retail customers And many retailers will tell you that the consumers are still buying and they're and they're still you know Uh, real they're they're they're fine. So I don't know how big the fiscal headwinds are and they haven't shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining spending So it must must have to do with the with the savings that people have What about the spending there's tens of billions yet to be spent? I mean from the inflation reduction act the American Rescue Plan chips act by parts and infrastructure bill Um, where how does that go and plan your thinking about the future? You know, it's um Demand is gonna have some support from those savings And also from the strong demand that's still in the labor market We still see pretty significant demand and and um a tightening labor market in some respects Although I think overall I would say it's not really tightening or or loosening So we see those things and what those things tell us is that you know our job Is going to require some resolve and some patience over time. We we're going to have to stick with this it's and and Um, you know, that's just we take we take all that as a given But we know what our objective is and we know what our tools can do and um That's how we think about it Hi chair pal Nancy Marshall Gensur from Marketplace I'm wondering has the window for a soft landing narrowed? Do you still think it's possible? Has the narrowed yes Is it still possible? Yes, uh, I think um, I we've always said it was going to be difficult But I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer it becomes harder to To see the path. It's it's narrowed. I would say the path is narrowed over the course of the last year really Um hard to say hard to say you know again, I would say that the Sort of array array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and to many economists um, there is a path to uh, there's your ordinary that there's a relationship to GP going down and uh, and vacancies uh, declining Translating into Unimplenit or there's Oaken's law so all those things are Relationships that are in the data and they're very real There's a little bit different this time though because you have this tremendously high level of vacancies and We think on a very steep part of the beverage curve All I would say is that that the The law the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated By those traditional measures because Uh, because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so strong Um, you know again, that's going to be something we discover empirically. I think No one knows whether there's going to be a recession or not and uh, if so how how bad that recession would be and um You know our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,75,2022-11-02 19:15:59
4682," That recession would be and our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time. And that's what we're going to do. Just real quickly, why do you feel like the window has narrowed? Because we haven't seen inflation coming down. The implication of inflation not coming down. What we would expect by now to have seen is that really as the supply side problems had resolved themselves. We would have expected goods inflation to come down by now, long since by now. And it really hasn't, although it's actually it has come down but it's not to the extent we had hoped. At the same time now you see services inflation, core services inflation moving up. And I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year without question. That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive. And that narrows the path to a soft landing, I would say. Thanks very much. Fed Chair Jay Powell just wrapping up his news conference after the central bank raised rates by 75 basis points for the fourth time in a row rates now. At the highest level that we have seen since 2008, but it was Powell's commentary that really sends stocks on a wild ride over the past 45 minutes or so. And we're trying to strike that both that dovish and hawkish tones going through some of those headlines as to why we saw equities bounce all over the place. The driving factor why we're in the red at this point with the Dow of 139 points of how saying that it's very premature to think about pausing rate hikes on pace for future rate hikes. He said that there are still ground to cover ongoing rate increases are appropriate at least at least at this time. He also said that the ultimate rate level will be higher than previously expected at the last September meeting and pairing that with that dovish tone to David was interesting because the market really wanted to hang on to anything that they could in terms of a dovish tone from pal. And we did see that we saw reflected in the market earlier this afternoon when pal did come out and say that he could potentially or the Fed could potentially pause rates at the December meeting. And so we're trying to figure out exactly which way the Fed is going to go. Yeah, again, the market says I said earlier kind of that guy walking through the desert just desperate for any drink of water. They took that one sip and raced up, but then pal reiterated not just once but twice again that word. He just said premature. It's premature to think about pausing and that's what really is the big picture takeaway and if there's two and I'll throw this one to you, Rochelle, he reiterated that again this was also twice and that's why it hit me that if we over tighten we have the tools to respond in the other case. We will entrench inflation expectations. That's what really gives you a sense of the direction moving forward for the Fed. We will say in this meeting we heard much more about the lag effects than we've heard in previous meetings. Obviously that's a concern that we've continued to hear from some economists and investors as well. And he talked about the three questions that are front of mind how fast they're moving. He said expeditiously, but he said that's less important than the other two questions which were how high and he said sufficiently restrictive to reach that 2% target over time with inflation. He said how long to remain at restrictive levels and he said that time may come that there may be discussion about it at the next meeting but then as we mentioned there, we also heard him saying look it's very premature to be thinking about pausing. So he was clearly trying to walk that fine line there, but as we saw from the market reaction, we did see the NASDAQ to negative first followed by the S&P but it's when he talked about it being very premature that we then saw the Dow also falling into negative territory as well. He talked about inflation being the possibility of it being entrenched. He said that there was no clear way of assessing that but as you mentioned it that he could use the tools from perhaps over tightening versus not doing enough and then having to keep going back and forth and allowing inflation to become entrenched. So he tried to walk that tight line, but as we see from the market reaction markets not not really on par there, definitely a lot more hawkish perhaps they were expecting sure enough. So it certainly looks like that. Michelle with the NASDAQ off nearly 2% right now. Okay, we want to bring in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,76,2022-11-02 19:20:19
4683," market's not really on par there. Definitely a lot more hawkish perhaps. They were expecting show now. It certainly looks like that. Rochelle with the Nasdaq off nearly 2% right now. Okay, we want to bring in the great hill of capital, a chairman. We have Thomas Hayes joining the show here to help us break down. What we just heard from Fed Chair Jay Palantin, you take a look at those headlines, trying to walk that very fine line, not trying to sound too hawkish, also didn't want to sound too dovish. Do you do a good job? A fair job. I think to Dave's point, it's equity bulls looking for a drink in the desert. He didn't give us much water, that's for sure. But he did leave on the table the possibility of a downshift in December from 75 to 50 or the next meeting. So the point is that the pace will be slowing at some point, even if the terminal rate is going to be higher. So we came into this meeting thinking the terminal rate might be about 4.6 to 5. Coming out of this, I do think that the downshift will be a positive thing. I think the markets will take 24 hours to digest this. And then we'll start to look company by company. But if you look at the seasonality that we're going into right now, we do have the election coming up. And that's coming up very, very shortly. The average return for the S&P in the 12 months following a midterm election is 18.6%. So he's trying to throw cold water on it. He has left the downshift. And he came out to the cumulative tightening. He's going to take that into account. He's going to take into account the lag. And then he completely threw cold water on it with the, it's premature to pause. So it's kind of double talk here. I think on balance, we've got two more CPI prints before the December meeting. We have the jobs report. Unfortunately, the Jelts report was a little hot yesterday. So we're not expecting miracles from the jobs report on Friday. 200,000 non-farm pay rolls. If it comes in hotter than that, market's going to price in 75 in December pretty quickly. If it comes in light, then maybe that downshift still is on the table. And there's no real indication that that CPI number on Thursday is going to be any better. We haven't seen, I mean, yes, use cars. We can see. He reiterated the labor market is a big problem. What else did we learn today that we didn't know an hour ago? Yeah. The labor market is definitely running hot. I mean, we were just talking about restaurants in Connecticut. You can't get a reservation at a good restaurant in Connecticut. So the economy continues to run hot. Labor market's hot. Inflation's hot. I know that there have been major speakers come out saying owners equivalent rent is miscalculated. It's going to take nine months to show up in the inflation numbers. We agree with that. The question is, is the Fed willing to wait and look through the windshield versus the rearview mirror? And right now, they're looking a lot through the rearview mirror and not maybe enough through the windshield. I think a good model to look at where we are right now is in 1948, post-World War II, when we borrowed a lot of money for the war to fight a visible enemy. Death to GDP got to 120%. They ran inflation above trend for about three to five years, three to five percent. And that ratio dropped from 120 down to 63 in just five years. So we might have to run inflation above trend. He did acknowledge long-term inflation expectations remain anchored. If you look at five-year inflation break-even, they're at 265. So they're getting close to the target. And Chair Powell has reiterated he's very concerned about expectations more than actual inflation. So so long as that long-term expectation stays anchored, we could start to see the downshifts that we've been looking for. If not in December, certainly in the following meeting. And as some investors are looking through the T-leaves here, we know that Jay Powell has asked about the three-month yields, talking about the inversion getting close, not there yet, though. And he did say that although it's his preferred measure, they are going to monitor it. But he did seem quite tight-lipped on that. What are your expectations about what the yield market is telling us? Well, you know, you initially saw bonds get bid on the news that they were going to actually pay attention to lagged effect of monetary policy. And by the time he finished the press conference, we were basically unchanged. The dollar sold off huge. Initially, when we saw, we're going to take into effect the cumulative tightening and we're going to take into effect the lags. Now the dollar is just off a little bit. So basically, we're unchanged here. But he came out way more hawkish in the press conference than...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,77,2022-11-02 19:24:42
4684," tightening and we're going to take into effect the lags. Now the dollar is just off a little bit. So basically we're unchanged here. He came out way more hawkish in the press conference than in the original statement. So the market didn't love that. But like all of these Fed meetings, what we usually find is the first move is often the wrong move. So give it a day to digest. I think as people say, it's very rare where we come to the table and we say the economy's strong. This is really bad news. What are we going to do about it? So I think it's a mix here. You know, if you look at earnings for this quarter, they're up 2.1%. They were expected to be up 2.8%. You back out energy. They were actually negative 0.6%. So he is destroying demand. If you look at the GDP for Q3 plus 2.7, if you back out the exports, which was a lot of energy and petroleum products, you actually had negative GDP. So their policy, they have to start to acknowledge that it is working on a lag basis. We started in March. You know, negative GDP, that in actuality, that would be the third negative GDP quarter. If you back out exports with earnings coming in slightly lower than expected. So these things are working on a lag basis. And the fact that he kept that downshift on the table, I think, is that drink of water in the desert, Dave. So what if we don't see that downshift, though, because there's already been criticism out there that the Fed has been way too hawkish up until this point. This was the fourth 75 basis point hike in a row. How did say he doesn't have a sense that the Fed has overtly and or that they have moved too fast? Are you at all concerned that they have been too aggressive up until this point? I do think when all of a sudden done, they'll find that they've been too aggressive and they'll have to pivot and actually start to cut sometime in 2023. If we've seen throughout history, it's always the case that they over tighten. The question is, how much they're going to look through the rearview mirror and how much they're going to look through the windshield. And right now, they're solely looking through the rearview mirror. And the reason the market initially rallied was that they said, OK, we will take into effect the lag basis, but then they discounted it completely. So I think when you look at the seasonality of the market, look, if the data comes in strong, it means the economy is strong. The market here at a multiple of 16.3 versus the 18.5 for the last 10 years, a lot of this bad news is priced in. The NASDAQ down 30%, S&P still down 18%. We have priced in a decent sized recession at this point, but stock selection and sector selection is going to be critical. You can't just say wholesale all in risk on. You really have to look case by case moving forward. OK, RJ Gallemey, the same reference. Look through the windshield and not the rearview mirror. Fine, you look through the windshield and tell me how they can even begin to consider pausing. Yeah, well, based on what data? Well, I think first and foremost, you look at commodities. They've completely rolled over since June. So that's going to be felt in the economy. You do see the GDP numbers. Basically, if you net out exports, you're looking at three consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. That's material. You look at earnings coming in lower than expected. You back out energy. You got negative earnings growth year on year. So this is only going to accelerate. So what would be nice is to see some back off in the CPI numbers, some of the inflation prints between now and December, to give them cover. They really need cover. They can't say we're going to predict that the CPI numbers are going to come down in six months. Therefore, we're going to pause. Give them something to hang their hat on, whether it doesn't appear that it's going to be the jobs report on Friday after the JALTS. But we've got four major prints between now and December. And maybe they don't downshift in December. Maybe it is the meeting afterwards. But he did effectively toggle and say, if not, December, then the meeting thereafter, in which case, people can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And the terminal rate, maybe it's not 4.6. Maybe it's 5. But so long as inflation expectations, the five-year break even stay anchored at 2.6, I think they'll be able to downshift sooner than everyone thinks, and certainly in the first quarter of next year. Nazou, and talking here, the loss is accelerating down now off 351 points NASDAQ off a nearly 3% right? Tom Hayes, thanks so much for joining us in studio. Thanks, Ron. Sure. All right, well, let's break down some of the biggest takeaways from the Fed's press conference today with Yahoo! Finances, Gen Sean Bouger, who was attending that so, Gen, what were you big?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,78,2022-11-02 19:29:03
4685," All right, well, let's break down some of the biggest takeaways from the Fed's press conference today with Yahoo! Finance is Jen Sean-Burger, who was attending this. So Jen, what were your big takeaways? Good afternoon, Rachelle Fedger-Powell, laying the groundwork to begin slowing down the pace of rate hikes, though he says he believes rates now need to move higher than previously forecast. He says the Fed is going to start talking about potentially slowing the pace of rate hikes at the next couple of meetings and we'll have a discussion with other Fed officials at the start of next meeting. Take a listen to the chairman. I would say as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed becomes less important than the second and third questions. And that's why I've said it the last two press conferences that at some point it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. The position has been made. It is likely we'll have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion. To be clear, let me say again, the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restrictive, which really will be our principal focus. And you heard Fed Chair-Powell saying that the pace of moderating rate hikes isn't as important as how high they could ultimately take. The Fed funds rate. He says the job is not done on inflation. In fact, inflation hasn't come down and it's pretty much where we were a year ago. He says it's premature to begin thinking about or talking about pausing rate hikes and that we still need to get to a sufficiently restrictive level on rate hikes. So he doesn't also think that we have over tightened, that the Fed has over tightened at this juncture. And again, the Fed raising rates by 3-quarters of a percentage point this afternoon to a new range of 3.75 to 4%. So Fed Chair-Powell standing hawkish at this juncture. That's certainly sounds hawkish and that certainly seems like what the markets believe at this point with the losses that we're seeing across the board, the S&P off just around 2% right now. Jen, what's up out to me with some of the commentary that he made on the labor market? Once again, reiterating that the labor market is extremely strong at this point, that demand far exceed supply. And then also consumer spending. When you said consumer spending, showing modest growth, fiscal headwinds haven't really restrained a spending up until this point and all that points to a more hawkish fed in the future. Yeah, I mean, certainly the Fed Chair believes that the job market does remain strong. You've pointed to another, a number of levels there. Notably that the unemployment rate remains low. The job gains continue, you saw the Jold's data, and so that really gives the Fed more room to raise rates without causing a deep recession. And he says that he and the Fed, other Fed officials are hopeful that cooling the labor market will not mean that we ultimately have layoffs, but more just fewer job openings in those sorts of junctures to try to bring down the level of tightness as opposed to an outright layoffs that would be akin to what you would have during a recession. Certainly, a ways to go with unemployment rate at a 50-year lower. Jen Chomburger, great job. Thanks so much. Well, there's plenty to come here on Yahoo Finance Live after the break. Investors have more direct access to treasuries, but find out what strategy you should employ following today's Fed decision. The CEO of Dine Brands, it tells us how Applebees and IHOP are succeeding despite recession fears. And earnings from Etsy Qualcomm, Robinhood, and Roku are all on tap will bring you the numbers as soon as they break.

4686,"boy Hehere so so so so so so The Federal Reserve announcing another 75 basis point rate hike today. But what does this hike mean for investors and their bond portfolio is joining us now to discuss as Alex Morris, FM Investments, President and Chief Investment Officer. He joins us as part of our weekly ETF report brought to you by Invest Go QQQ. So Alex, when you take a look at the reaction that we're seeing play out in the bond markets, yields on the 10-year treasury moving to the upside once again right now at 410, what's your takeaway guess from what we just heard from Palom? What does this mean to your foreign investors? Well, I think the Chairman makes a good point. We're not going to have a crystal ball. I read the statement before coming here and everything looked fine until the press release happens and I think it's pretty clear rates are going higher and they're going to stay there for a while longer. And long term, I think the Fed is making clear they will get a handle on things. So things will come back to normal. It's just going to take a while. And that's more or less what we should expect. These things don't happen on a dime and when they do, we all get very nervous and overly excited. So then Alex, for retail investors who are wondering how they should be approaching treasuries right now, talk about the ETF and some of the ways that they can get into this, perhaps if they're a little bit risk of us. Sure. So first of all, we built the ETFs because investing in treasuries is a tried and true strategy, but yet remains stubbornly difficult for most investors, retail advisors and otherwise. They trade in fractions, they have messy cash flows. They're not as simple to trade as stocks for a variety of reasons. And we built these single security, single treasury ETFs to make that much easier. Folks start looking at the yield curve and they start looking at all the various issues and it becomes very complicated very quickly. So as you start to look at how do you want to approach this, you want something as security of a treasury, but you don't want to make a mistake in how you invested it. So we built access to the most liquid, most straightforward treasuries today, which are the on the runs. These who are really looking for short term havens really should look at something on the shorter end of the curve, which is for us the 90 day product. And those who want to take a much longer term view on the economy and where the Fed ultimately land things should look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,80,2022-11-02 19:37:53
4687," on the shorter end of the curve, which is for us the 90 day product. And those who want to take a much longer term view on the economy and where the Fed will ultimately land things should look towards the farther end of the curve, which for us is in the 10 year product. So, you take a look at demand right now for these funds, what we're seeing playing out, given the fact that it is such an uncertain environment. I guess when people are second guessing what they should be doing, when it comes to investing in treasuries, what's one or two things you would advise them to take into consideration? First thing we tell everyone is this to show pass, right? So, not to fall off an long-term asset allocation or long-term game plan. Yeah, timing the market never really works terribly well. But if you're more worried about short-term movements, stay on the shorter end of the curve, continue to remain invested, but don't think this is the opportunity to try to outrun the market. You won't be successful, and if you do, it'll probably catch up to you pretty quickly. And Alex, you said that treasuries, a quote, finally interesting again. Talk about this period that way and give us some context given how we've historically seen the market move. Sure. So, for the last little pre-2008 treasuries had a long history of being somewhat elevated. Then all of a sudden, we entered a decade of zero interest rates, which is something that hadn't really been seen or thought of before. And many investors have gotten used to relatively low-cost capital that can fuel all sorts of things in the bond market in new and interesting ways, as well as the equity markets, which we certainly saw in the past decade. Now as rates go up, and we look backwards, you know, 20 years ago, rates were higher than this, and certainly in the 80s substantially higher. So now, as we move rates up to try to destroy some demand, as Chairman Powell made very clear, now we have to decide how do we get access to yield, as well as have some negative correlation, at least historically, to the equity markets. Traditionally, that's been treasuries. Certainly, credit spreads have started to widen, but haven't cracked yet, which is still a good sign for the bond market. But for those who have been risk on, and now we're looking for a safe haven, treasuries have traditionally been that location to go to, and we built products to make that easy to access. Access certainly important, especially for retail investors trying to get a hand-blown all these movements. Alex Morris, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, coming up, Paramount is generating a lot of bonds on Wall Street today, but that's not a good thing. We'll tell you why shares are falling, thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,81,2022-11-02 19:42:09
4688,". Now 18 months into this episode of High Inflation, we don't have a clearly identified scientific way of understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. And so the thing we need to do from a risk management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation under control, get it down to 2% get it behind us. That's what we really need to do and what we're strongly committed to doing. That's fair, Jay Powell is saying it's premature to talk about pausing the rate hikes here. We're seeing that reflected in the markets this afternoon, which is about 18 minutes to go until the closing bell. You're looking at the Dow, all 348 points, Nasdaq, the worst performer of the three meter averages, off just around 2.7% J.R. Blickrey as a closer look at the big board. Some of the selling that we're seeing as a result of what we just heard from Powell. That's right. It's let's go through some of the market movements here. I think it was instructive to view what happened first, and then what happened next at 2 p.m. We got a bullish tilt to the markets and that's based on expectations that the Fed might eventually, I guess, pair back the blistering pace of rate hikes. But Powell put a quick end to that early on in the presser. And you got to think that the Fed is actually doing its job here. The Fed doesn't want to see stocks higher on a day when it's contemplating or at least signalling that it might back off the rate of rate hikes here. And that's what we're getting. So the S&P 500 down 2%, I'm going to go through some other markets here. Volatility is up. You can see the VIX. Well, the VIX is actually net down from that time period. And so that's pretty interesting. Gonna make a note of that. Five-year T-note yield did drop on that announcement. And then it basically came back to the entry point. And then the 10-year T-note. It's actually higher based on the 2 p.m. print that we got. And finally, here's the 13-week T-build rate that tricks tracks closely what the Fed's short term to Fed funds market is doing right now. Now, the US dollar index ended higher as well. So all of this is signalling that there might be some more risk aversion in the markets. Although we're getting a conflicting picture here between yields in the dollar. I think we're going to see that sorted out over the next 24 hours. Also want to show you what's happening in Bitcoin because this would be the Supreme irony. If Bitcoin actually led the way, it didn't fully participate up to the upside. Wasn't as up as much as some of the equities and now it is given those back. So Bitcoin for telling the future that maybe we have to wait a few more announcements before we're going to get that final pivot that everybody's been expecting. That would be some irony right there. Let me just close with some of the sector actions and heat maps that we're looking at. Everything in the red right now is talking about the hit that we're taking to yields. Normally that would benefit some of the mega caps, but not today. We're seeing consumer discretionary tech and also communication services down more than 2%. So again, it's probably too early to parse out what these movements quite mean. Going to take another day or so, but in the meantime, stocks are down. Maybe Chair Paul did his job. I guess so. Even energy down 2.2%. Wow, good stuff. Chair Blickrey, appreciate that. All right, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, addressing the state of the housing market in the wake of today's interest rate hike. The housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. We're well aware of what's going on there. From a financial stability standpoint, we didn't see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the global financial crisis. Housing credit was very carefully.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,82,2022-11-02 19:46:16
4689," Point we didn't see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the global financial crisis. Housing credit was very carefully, much more carefully managed by the lenders. So it's a very different situation and doesn't present potential financial, doesn't appear to present financial stability issues. Rising mortgage rates have soured housing demand recently but there is some good news that a glimmer today if you will with the 30 year fixed falling a bit to 7.06% from 7.16 a week ago. That's according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Now rates are still near two decade highs and we also saw applications decreasing for the sixth straight week. Now lenders and other companies in the industry are reeling amid the broader slowdown. CNBC reporting Wells Fargo was processing about 18,000 retail loans early in the quarter down almost 90% from a year earlier. And mortgage staff at the bank are bracing for layoffs. It's not just the big lenders. Open door. A home flipping company announcing layoffs of 18% of its employees that amounts to roughly 550 people. And the stock is down 4.5% on the news and extending losses in the wake of the Fed decision. Now look, when we bake in the 75 point hike and the fact that it is again premature to think about pausing, you got a factor 30 year fixed driving up at least a quarter of a point. They're going to continue to go up and the housing market will continue to slow in resale. That probably is going to cost thousands of jobs in the mortgage industry. And you reference that CNBC article. Obviously when you have this slowdown, think of where we were during the pandemic field boom in the housing market. It was just a matter of time when you now see the downside of that. You're also seeing the higher mortgage rates. And so they're obviously far off their peak. And we know that they began cutting workers in April Wells Fargo did. And so a lot of people, some of the sources mentioned in the article there saying that some of these though have been a mix of some voluntary bankers sort of seeing the writing on the wall and moving on to other positions. So kind of clouding the picture as to how much of this has been voluntary versus how much of these layoffs had to be done. Now we know that last month, CFO, Mike, Santa, Massimo told analysts that we expect it to remain challenging in the near term. It's possible we have a further decline in mortgage banking revenue in the Q4 when originations are seasonally slower. So certainly bad timing on top of everything else. But obviously a very tough time there. And a lot of people at Wells Fargo concerned about job security. Yeah, I don't think this comes as a huge surprise given the massive slow down that we've seen in the industry. We've been talking to a number of guests about what we are seeing play out in the mortgage industry specifically and how challenging it's likely going to be over the coming quarters given the fact what we just heard from J Pal today that he is going to remain hawkish or it's still premature to talk about pausing rates or even any sort of pivot. So certainly it's going to be a tough time ahead. There was a recent dead out from black night saying that just 133,000 US homeowners at this point can save money by refinancing at today's rates. And that's sound date from a peak of over 19 million in late 2020. So really see that really just illustrates how dramatically this industry has changed over the last year and a half or two years from the peak of the pandemic to this really this. I don't want to call it a bus that almost seems a little bit too aggressive at this point, but a significant slowing that we are seeing play out in the mortgage industry and layoffs as a result. And pal said they're looking for some softening in the labor market. If they're looking really hard, they should look at the mortgage industry. That's where you'll see the beginning of some cracks in the labor market coming up electronic arts voicing optimism following its latest earnings much of it.

4690,"?! It's time for a triple play, the three stocks that we're watching in the last 10 minutes of trading. We've got MoneyGram, Paramount and Electronic Arts on deck. Now my pick is person-to-person payment service MoneyGram. The company debuting a feature allowing US consumers to trade and store Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin via its mobile app. Now the company joins others attempting to bring real-world cryptocurrency and blockchain use cases to life for everyday consumers. In a statement, Alex Holmes, MoneyGram's chairman and CEO said, Cryptocurrencies are additive to everything we're doing at MoneyGram. MoneyGram enables instant access to over 120 currencies around the globe and we see crypto and digital currencies as another input and output option. Now this isn't MoneyGram's first foray into crypto, but it's moving more conservatively this time with just a few more established crypto tokens. Its previous partnership with Ripple came to an end last May after Ripple got sued by the SEC in December of 2020. Of course Coinbase recently joined a number of groups in arguing that the SEC's case threatens the broader industry, so still a lot of volatility to be had here, but MoneyGram though it's still pressing ahead here, Sean. There are pressing ahead. It's not doing a lot for the stock today though. When you take a look at the market, at the reaction, although obviously there's a bigger macro picture going on. In today's market action, but certainly if you take a look at the stock down just a fraction here, so not a lot of excitement. I think potentially MoneyGram's move here, you can make the argument that it could BBB step forward into making Bitcoin cryptocurrency taking that mainstream, giving access to more and more users in terms of that. There was a recent Deloitte survey saying that there certainly is appetite out there for users to be able to get access to cryptocurrencies and use that as part of their transaction. Three quarters of retailers plan to accept either cryptocurrency or stablecoin payments within the next few years. Three quarters, 75 percent. That number stuck out to me because I thought it was a bit high when you think about how many transactions are actually done with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies today. My pick today is Paramount. It's a top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance. Look at that losses of just over 12 percent shares are sinking after revenue missed of Wall Street estimates. A number of headwinds facing the company, including the rise of cord cutting and a slow down in the advertising market. Now sales from its TV media segment falling 5 percent from the previous quarter to 4.9 billion. An advertising revenue dropping 3 percent to 1.9 billion. Paramount plus was a highlight for the quarter though.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,84,2022-11-02 19:55:10
4691," mint falling 5% from the previous quarter to 4.9 billion. An advertising revenue dropping 3% to 1.9 billion. Paramount Plus was a highlight for the quarter, though. 4.6 million new subscribers were added. That was actually better than what the street was looking for. What many analysts were anticipating, bringing its total to 46 million customers. Dave comparing that to larger competitors. Obviously, just a fraction of subscribers, but they are headed in the right direction. They are variety. They're reporting some layoffs coming as they consolidate with showtime. Some positives coming to Paramount Plus. You've got top-gun and smile coming to the format by the end of the year. And of course, that Walmart Plus subscription half price. That includes a free Paramount Plus subscription system catalyst there. My play is EA Electronic Arts. Shares up on its latest earnings report. Despite a post-pandemic pullback in gaming and currency headwinds, EA did beat on revenue and EPS. The company touting a record-breaking launch of FIFA 23 with over 10.3 million players within the first week, signaling the biggest launch period ever in EA sports FIFA franchise history. They added this year's title. It's been played in more than 200 nations worldwide. The CEO Andrew Wilson sang the entire global football community across our ecosystem will benefit from the unique holiday timing of the World Cup. And that's because of the change of the schedule because of the heat in Qatar. It's now just 18 days away, by the way. They did lower their annual bookings forecast between 7.65 and 7.85 billion from 7.9 to 8.1 billion. Overall, the gaming market is expected to grow just 2% in 2022. So you're really seeing some shrink in there. Earlier this week, EA also announced a three-game deal with Marvel, which will start with an Ironman game, the stock up. But just about 2% wasn't much higher, but like the rest of the market pulled back a bit down about 4% your to date for show. I mean, I will say you couldn't have asked for better time if you thought that EA, FIFA, and the World Cup. You want to talk about a match made in heaven. I'm super excited for the World Cup. You will hear me talking about it constantly. So yes, a boon there, obviously. Someone even on Twitter challenged me to a FIFA match. Well, I was like, I don't even play a game. I'm going to take them up on it. But oh, you don't play. I've got to try. I don't even play. But I might just out of spite. All right. I'm very excited for the World Cup to getting underway very, very soon. All right, well, coming up next, we are counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. We'll be right back. All right, yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,85,2022-11-02 19:59:44
4692," Uncle All right. Let us take a few minutes away from the closing bell on this Wednesday Fed, delicious liquor here to break down the MarkACon action. What are we seeing, sir? A lot of reds, so maybe the Fed is doing its job if it doesn't like to see green markets on Fed day who says to say Nasdaq down over three percent, so it was a rustle 2000. I'm going to show you inside the Nasdaq 100 Mega Caps taking it on the chin here, Apple down more than 3 percent. So is Microsoft Alphabet, Tesla down 5 percent, Amazon for Meta 4, Costco 3 percent, and the list goes on and let's take a look at the sector action to see what's going on. These are the tech heavy and mega cap heavy sectors that we see down here. Utilities the least dirty shirt in the laundry basket. That's still off 9, 10th of a percent followed by financials and health care. So all in all, not the best banner day for equities. We'll have to see what happens tomorrow. But here is our leader in sentiment index, not index, but markets. We see Kweb that's a Chinese internet ETF. You can say divorce from the current day. Other than that, it has been a week day for a lot of these fringe market. Let's take a look at the travel sector. And we are here for the closing though. Stocks ending the day in the red. As we wrap up the trading action, post Fed share, J-Pow's, press are there and look at those losses ending at the lows of the day, the Dow of 500 and six points. S&P off just around two and a half percent. NASDAQ, the biggest laggard here in today's action, off just nearly three and a half percent. A lot of those rate sensitive stocks, many of them tied to the tech sector, leading today's sell off. And the market's really focused on the fact that Fed share, J-Pow, saying that it is too premature to think about causing rates saying that there is still plenty of ground to cover ongoing rate increases seem appropriate at this point. So let's talk about what this means for the markets going forward. For that, we want to bring in Sam Stovall. He's CFRA's research, chief investment strategist. And we also have Michael Kushma, Morgan Stanley, investment management, chief investment officer, broad markets, fixed income. Sam, let me start with you. I guess just your reaction to what we heard from Fed share, J-Pow, and the selling that we saw as a result. Well, Shona, I guess I'm not too surprised because the Fed has been telling us for a while that it does not want to make the same mistakes that it did back in the 1970s. It doesn't want to end up pausing or even pivoting before they know that inflation is under control. And we've also seen over the last week several reports, whether it's Q3 GDP, construction spending, or the expectations for Friday's jobs report, that the Fed still is engaged in an uphill battle with inflation. And Michael, we are from previous analysts. They commented that the markets were just a little bit too enthusiastic about what they thought they were going to hear from J-Pow. And as we see from the sell-off that we saw today, that seemed to be the case. What is it that they are missing when it comes to this picture right now? Well, I think that J-Pow said something along these lines. And it's press conference today. There's three elements to monetary policy. How fast, how high, how long. And we had even gotten to that, including how fast they were going to go. Only today that is really start talking about, yes, at some point we're talking about slowing down. So not even yet finished with phase one, which then is, well, how high do we have to go? So they're not even clear about all high they have to go. And then they're certainly not clear how long they will have to stay. I did think the emphasis on not wanting to, they want to take into account the long lags on monetary policy does suggest, at some point, they will slow down because the monetary tightening so far will impact the economy. But it's premature to talk about slowing down yet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,86,2022-11-02 20:04:11
4693," slow down because the monetary so far will impact the economy, but it's premature to talk about slowing down yet. So to Michael's point, Sam, how high do you have to go? Do you think we're talking about a Fed funds rate around five? And do you factor in hikes through March? Yeah, Jared. I think we're going to see the Fed funds rate right now. Our target is between five and five and a quarter. And the Fed is suspect to being raised over the coming months. Where our belief is that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points in December. And then we'll engage in another 50 basis points in the February time frame. So the Fed's not done yet. And I think it's going to be in the fives before we hit a terminal rate. Sam, right about the risk then of the Fed going way too far. I know Paul saying at least up until the Fed, we're going to be able to keep the state of tightening too much. But if in fact we do see another 75 followed by another 50, where does that look? Well, I think that even from the very start, a, at least a mild recession was something that investors had to anticipate. Any time that the year on year percent change in headline CPI exceeded 6% going back to the late 1940s. We ended up with a bear market and a lot of the time that the Fed had been going back to the end of the year. And so the Fed ended up being deeper and lasting longer than average bear markets without recessions. So just the fact that the Fed was already 750 basis points behind the curve, meaning that normally Fed funds rate is higher than the year on your CPI number at the start of rate tightening programs. But this time around, the things were reversed by that 750 basis points. And so by earning on the more hawkish side with these comments, how should investors be thinking about this period between now and the next Fed meeting? I think it's as the Fed has said multiple times they've given up on forward guidance. The world is too uncertain. We don't know what's going to happen. So it's very data dependent. We'll have to see the flow of data. However, in order to be more confident about the inflate and improvement between now and December, you don't have a lot of months, a lot of times. Even if we get a better inflation print this month and early December before the next Fed meeting, it might well not be enough. It may be enough to keep them at 50. But to go less than it, I think it's it's not not feasible at all. So 50 is sort of the is the minimum next month. But going forward in 2023, it does become extremely data dependent right now. The momentum in the US economy is bit on the upswing. And job growth is slowing, but at a fairly slow pace, such that the unemployment rate is likely to stay low. So again, the danger if they prematurely slow the pace of ease of tightening and then move maybe to easing too soon, become. You'll just reaccelerate again and there'll be in a worse position at the end of next year. Well, I think you have to continue defense investing from a defensive perspective. Looking at my momentum model, basically it is the old standby of staples, health care utilities, and also to energy. And whereas you want to be avoiding those groups that tend to get hurt the most by rising rates, which would be your growth areas, communication services, technology, real estate. So right now it's, you know, playing it close to the best with defensive sectors is probably the best way to go. Sam Stovar and Michael Kushner there. Thank you so much for joining us on this Fed date with your market breakdown. Dave. Thanks for sharing our earnings alert here. Qualcomm has now reported Dan Halley is here to break down the numbers. You can see shares moving to the downside about 7% after hours. Dan, what do we see? The revenue they came at at 11.39 they expected was 11.4. So you can, you know, kind of round up there and they're meeting it. But as far as adjusted EPS, they missed. They came at $3.11 for its expectations of 3.13. But the big deal here is for the next quarter, they're Q1.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,87,2022-11-02 20:08:11
4694, a miss they came in at three dollars eleven cents for its expectations of three thirteen but the big deal here is for the next quarter their q one they have expectations for adjusted eps of two twenty five to two forty five the expectation though from wall street was for them to announce three dollars and forty cents that's a big difference so that's why we're starting to see or potentially why we're starting to see that stock price start to slip now down around five percent and part of that has to do with the smartphone market now we're seeing weakness there as far as people not necessarily needing or wanting to go out and buy smartphones making these big kind of pricey purchases when the economy is you know we're hearing so much about a potential recession and I think that seeps down to the the average consumer and so they they kind of pull back on that kind of spending especially on something like a smartphone where look if the one in your pocket works you don't necessarily need a new one it's more of a luxury buy when you don't have those kinds of issues so I do think that that's probably something that we're going to continue to talk about obviously apple it had a lighter quarter than expected for their iPhone sales so that's a you know a pretty good indicator of how the rest of the industry is doing especially since you know it's apple hopefully we get a read on if that apple relationship is going to continue longer than we originally thought which could certainly help Dan howley thank you good stuff there with Qualcomm earnings all right Roku has now released third quarter earnings after the Bell Yahoo fanatcis alley canal has those numbers for us and look at that stock alley down 20% after hours it's it's pretty stunning and it was an interesting story after the market closed after we've got these earnings because it's surged and then it came way down so let's break down with investors initially reacted to we had it beat on revenue 761.4 million versus the expected 702.35 million also a narrower adjusted loss per share of 80 cents versus the expected dollar 22 so beat there on both the top and bottom lines also a beat on active account growth but here's the bad news and that's what's driving down the stock by more than 20% it's their guidance the company now sees fourth quarter adjusted ebitel loss at about 135 million versus the expected loss of 45.5 million so that's a huge discrepancy that Wall Street is reacting to net revenue guidance for the fourth quarter also lower 800 million versus 897 million expected and we're just getting news as well that Roku CFO Steve Loudon plans to leave the company in 2023 so this is just a lot of information for investors to digest in the earnings release the company said quote as we enter the holiday season we expect the macro environment to further pressure consumer discretionary spend and degrade advertising budgets now advertising is what's been talked about with a lot of these tech companies especially following the results of meta snap alphabet the state of digital advertising largely in question amid a lot of these macro economic challenges so a lot of near term headwinds for this company they have been spending pretty aggressively they did say they were going to cut back on head count but right now investors not too happy there was shares down more than 20 percent in after hours quite the sell-off indeed a big thank you there to our very own alley canal I will stay with us coming up we're taking a closer look at Qualcomm earnings the stock sliding on that weak guidance as you can see they're off more than 6% stay with us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,88,2022-11-02 20:12:26
4695," secrets of the glamour of artists. Let's take a look at Robinhood. Their earnings report just released. You can see shares up just around 2.7 percent of beat up both the top and bottom lines here for Robinhood sales. Coming in, 361 million. The estimate was for 355.2 million. And there were loss than expected as well, loss of 20 cents. The estimate was for loss of as much as 31 cents transaction based on revenue coming in 208 million. That was short of what the street was expecting. Though crypto revenue also coming in a bit like their 51 million estimate out there was for 56 million monthly active users totaling 12.2 million. That was a bit lighter than what the street was hoping to see at 13.7 million. Average revenue per user coming in a $63 estimate out there was for 62.58. So a better reading on there than what we had initially anticipated from the street. But the beat's on both the top and bottom line specifically what we're seeing in revenue 361 million. Better than what the street was looking for a 358 million. That's a big reason why shares are up just over 2 percent in after we're straighting. Michelle. And while a different story for Qualcomm moving down was there, you see them more than 7 percent. That's after reporting forthcult results. We have Christopher Roland joining us. Tuscquoana International Group Senior Equity Analyst to really break this down for us. So as you dive into this earnings report here, what was it that you think was really the problem? Yeah, there are a confluence of headwinds that they're now experiencing. So they at the same time as seeing a rapid deterioration in demand. They've also seen supply constraints ease for most of their competitors. So this has resulted in elevated channel inventories that are now going to take multiple quarters to fully get through. How did the guidance look? The guidance was dreadful, truthfully. So we're looking at about 9.6 billion versus estimates of 12 billion. So this is probably the worst Qualcomm guide. I remember in multiple years here, they also lowered their overall outlook for total handset volumes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,89,2022-11-02 20:16:56
4696," I remember in multiple years here, they also lowered their overall outlook for total handset volumes from they were previously at mid-single digit declines. They're now at low double digit declines for the calendar year. So pretty dreadful. Chris, going into this earnings report, you had 165 price target and neutral rating on the stock. You said that this is the worst guidance that we had seen in quite some time. So what does that mean for just in terms of what we could potentially see over the coming quarters? And are you changing your rating because of this? Yeah, our rating right now is neutral. We downgraded shares last year on a bigger, broader, semi-s downgrade for the entire industry because we were worried about this. We were worried about overshipping. Four-qual-com, this is a fantastic company that is reinventing themselves. We're going to take a fresh look at this after we have these reset, this reset overall. But Qualcomm over the next few quarters is going to have to work through this inventory. And if we get line of sight into clearance on that inventory side, we would get perhaps more aggressive. And Christopher, in terms of where you see the growth story coming in terms of what's going to be driving growth for Polkham, especially after this earnings report, where do you see the opportunities? Yeah, their biggest opportunity is going to be automotive. They recently, this quarter, held a automotive day and they have some significant opportunities. For example, ADAS and autonomous driving, that will be a very, very big push for them overall as they continue to diversify outside of just handsets. But in handsets, 5G is not done yet globally. India is just starting to ramp 5G, for example. That'll be a new opportunity for them as well. And then they're moving into RF components as well to compete with guys like Skyworks and Corvo on that side of the handset as well. So we view that as opportunity for them entirely. This is Duckarty Down 37% year today. We were expecting or are expecting some news on that relationship with Apple and how long it may be extended. What do you expect there? Yeah, if you hear anything, let me know. But the expectation right now is that the internal modem development program in Apple is taking longer. They are going to need at least another year here. And so Qualcomm right now is in the cat bird seat in terms of negotiations. They will likely be able to negotiate nice prices for their modem and their 5G modem and content into that phone for at least another year. But we'll see where they go from there. Chris, we're going to get the earnings call underway very shortly. I guess what's the number one thing you want to hear from management? I know guidance is your big focus here. This large slump that they are expecting to see in terms of the smartphone industry. But what's the number one thing you're hoping to hear? Yeah. Number one is going to be this handset slump that we're in. What ining are we in? How much of this shortfall here was actually true demand versus inventory digestion? How long is this inventory digestion going to take? And when might we get to the other side of it? Is this a one or two quarter event or is this going to last well into the second half of next year? These are the things that are important for me. All right, we're looking forward to hearing you back. After that, Chris, Verol and SIG appreciate that. Sir, thank you. Let's have another earnings alert. Now he shares of Etsy are moving well up, almost 10% on their Q3 earnings. Yahoo, finances, Ali Garfingle here with the numbers. Ali, what do we see him? Great to see you, Dave. So we're getting some good news out of tech today. Etsy's popping on that Gross Merch sales beat. It came in at $3 billion as opposed to the expected $2.9 billion. We also saw a revenue beat, Dave. $5.540, about $600 million as opposed to the $563.6 million expected. We did see a loss per share at $7.62. And there were slight misses right on active fires, active, s-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,90,2022-11-02 20:21:11
4697," 600 million as opposed to the 563.6 million expected. We did see a loss per share at 762 and there were slight misses right on active fires, active sellers, but it's that Q4 revenue guidance day. We've seen so many revenue guidance misses for Q4, but Etsy's coming in within the range between 700 and 780 million as opposed to the expected 744.6 million. So good news out of Etsy today. We'll see if they can keep it up. Yeah, you talked about another company that desperately needed that good new. Been beat down down 58% year to date put up. Double figures now on that news. Great stuff, Ali Garfengal. Appreciate that. Coming up right here. Shares of Roku have slid by roughly 75% year's date. See what Wall Street expects from the streaming platform for the rest of the year. Next. And then a broader market sell off, Dine Brands ending the day modestly higher after reporting better than expected third quarter results. Yeah, the finances Brian Sosie sat down with the CEO of Dine Brands, John Payton, to discuss the key to its brand success in the past quarter. Take a listen. We had a really good quarter. Applebee's had its seventh consecutive same-store sales growth. IHOP had its sixth consecutive same-store sales growth. Average weekly sales for both brands is now equal to exceeding 2019. And that's because our brands are trusted and well-known by our guests. You know, and tough times like this, people flock to brands that they that they trust. And Applebee's and IHOP are about great value. They always have been and that's couldn't be more important than it is right now. There's nothing like taking a bad day of work and just having eight pancakes, John. I mean, why not? Those multi-grain pancups, pancakes that I hopper my jam, but take us through each brand. What are you working on without?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,91,2022-11-02 20:25:37
4698," There's nothing like taking a bad day of work and just having eight pancakes, John. I mean, why not? Those multi-growing pancakes that I offer my jam. But take us through each brand. What are you working on with Applebees? So Applebees is focusing on its core menu, really great marketing innovation. So this summer, for example, they partnered with Top Gun and they partnered with Fandango. And so for every $25 you spent at Applebees, you could earn a free ticket to Top Gun. And so Applebees does really creative marketing like that. I think that the best television in the business, they really focus on the nostalgic music. And this is a time where they're really attracting their guests. And they're also very focused on promotions right now, really rich promotions. So at Applebees, it's 12 shrimp for a buck with a steak. Wow. And 12 shrimp for a dollar with a steak. And that's the kind of value-edited promotion that our guests need right now. That's really good. It's tough times. So you mentioned tough times in that type of promotion. Is that, have you seen sales slow down because of a promotion like that? Or what made you run that? We run promotions like that because we know, right, with the inflationally it is and the cost of living, particularly for our guests. It is a tough time right now. So our brands have been through this before. They're both positioned as, you know, value-oriented brands in their category. And they know what's needed at times like this. So that promotion for Applebees, IHOP has just finished up two by two by two, which is two pancakes, two proteins and two eggs for five bucks. And both of those promotions drove traffic, which is why we had quarter of a quarter of Sam's to our sales growth. Is the environment so tough that you're going to have to continue these promotions into the holiday season? The environment is tough, right? And so, you know, we really lean into the love that people have for our brands. And the promotions, the promotions, you know, will continue. But I should also say that we're working on things that drive the longer term, right? So at the same time, we're very focused on our consumer and how they're feeling right now. You know, IHOP just launched its loyalty program, you know, the International Bank of Pancakes, which is, we're clever, right? You can earn pancoins and you redeem them in the stack market. And so, you know, we launched that program in April and we've already enrolled 3.5 million people. And that's a million more than we thought we would do at this time, which really speaks to, you know, the power of the brand and the need for loyalty, you know, and that's the way we're really needing it to grow in the brand. If you're running promotions like that, does that mean you've seen a peak in inflation? Yeah, there's good news here. So through the first half of the year, the cost of goods, food and goods into our restaurants was up about 22% in the first half of the year. The back half of the year, Applebee's will be more like 14, 15%, and IHOP is just down a couple of points because eggs and wheat, which drives pancakes, are still very high. So you know, we think it's going to allow our franchisees to, you know, to start to edge back toward more historical price increases, which are about 2 or 3% a year versus the 7 to 11% that they took in 2022. Is finding workers still a challenge? Good news there as well. So for the last four or five quarters, we were about stuck at about 90% of what we would consider full staffing. And in the last couple of months, it's 92, 93%. And we're finding that even the hard to fill jobs are getting more applicants like cooks in the kitchen. And so we're moving from recruiting to, it's all about retention now. And our franchisees are getting very creative to make sure that they retain their new team members. They're offering signing bonuses, retention bonuses, recruiting bonuses. They're extending 401k to a broader portion of their team members to wish in reimbursement. So it's all about keeping the people they've got. I don't want to get too wonky on this, but we've usually talked to the team at Chipotle and they've started to put in robots into their kitchens. Do you see a place in your restaurants with them? We do. Right? So we talked about staffing. And we're assuming that maybe 92%, 93% is the new normal. And at the same time, we need to help our restaurants become more productive, particularly as costs grow as well. So we're looking at, we're testing a robot in one of our IHOPs that can serve food and then to flip pancakes. We've all got their symbols applied, right? Are there any centers that you can see for the completion of найд gradient education of urban Germany?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,92,2022-11-02 20:29:55
4699," Outsc grow as well. So we're looking at, we're testing a robot in one of our eye hops that can serve food and then to flip pancakes. And to not yet, but that's coming and take the dishes back. It's like a little R2-D2 and guess love it, right? Because it's clever, but it makes servers more efficient. We're looking at robotics in the kitchen, you know, about for fryers to automate frying and things like that. As well as server tablets. For, you know, we've got server tablets at 500 of our Applebees, which makes servers more efficient. They turn more tables. They earn more tips. And so automation in robotics is a big part of having our restaurants be more efficient in the future. When does Applebees get back to opening up restaurants? So Applebees just finished last year a purposeful and deliberate three year refinement of the brand. We closed about 300 restaurants that were, you know, where the market moved away from them and they run profitable. So now we've got a core of about 1600 restaurants that are, you know, in great markets are profitable and are super strong. And so, you know, we envision transitioning to net growth starting in next year or early, early 24. And I hop too. I hop is a real success story. So we're going to open 50 plus restaurants this year. And that's during, you know, a time when the cost of constructing a restaurant has really become more expensive. So our franchisees are leaning into I hop because of the success we've had in their belief of it in the future. Thanks to Brian, Sasi and Dymarins, a CEO, John Payton. And they were interesting stuff there because he was very optimistic in terms of what we could expect here from the company going forward. But certainly a number of headwinds and what he said about labor really highlights what's going on on so many levels in terms of the trend that we're seeing play out in the economy and the inability or tough time that so many companies are having getting people through their doors. For usual, we are aligned on our interpretation of the interview. Yeah, it's in a fascinating dynamic in the restaurant industry right now. He's talking about retention. They used to have recruitment bonuses. Now they have retention bonuses. They're talking about tuition reimbursement. I've talked to a number of restaurant tours that have already built and are ready to go with beautiful restaurants. They are hiring recruitment firms, Richelle, just to try to staff restaurants and you have a lot of power if you are that employee, if you can manage a restaurant to go in and call your own shot and raise your wages. It's a really bad dynamic if you're John, but if you are looking for a job in the restaurant industry, now is the time. I mean, it's been a tough dynamic because you can go to restaurants around the DC, Maryland area and you just can't get a table because there just isn't the staff thing. So it's good to see them investing on that front. Otherwise, very interesting that that 12 shrimp for a dollar, if you buy a steak, I mean, people are looking for a good deal. So clearly, try to make everyone happy. They try to make the work is happy. And of course, clearly the customers as well. So yeah, we're really interesting interview there. Let's talk a little bit more about some good deals that you could potentially get because we have been focusing on this inflation story so closely, especially today in the aftermath of the Fed decision as many food giants and grocery stores raise prices. One is doing just the opposite for Thanksgiving. Aldi is going to match 2019 prices for holiday staples. Starting today, prices will be cut 30% from where they are. Now, in Rochelle, this news coming at a time when it is needed for so many Americans, Turkey costs are projected to rise. 23% this year, Wells Fargo saying that the overall cost of a Thanksgiving basket is going to cost 14.9%, basically 15% more than it did a year ago. So the fact that Aldi is coming out offering these prices is saying that what we've seen just around three years ago certainly a move that is welcome from so many of their customers. And we know that the avian flu obviously took a toll on the Turkey population, which then in turn is driving up prices. Now, this Thanksgiving price rewind promotion as they're calling it. It's not just on your turkeys. Your appetizers, desserts, sides, beverages, all discounted up to 30%. Now, Aldi is a brand that's very well known in most parts of Europe. But no, not a lot of people we were discussing this earlier, haven't ever stopped it, Aldi, before. So perhaps a good chance to sort of get in the door there once you see prices discounted this much. Yeah, they're a private company. That's how they can do that. They don't have to worry about shareholders, right? But, you know, Gen Z, the popular trend right now that you're seeing, of course, where else on TikTok.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,93,2022-11-02 20:34:11
4700," Yeah, there are private companies. That's how they can do that. They don't have to worry about shareholders, right? But, you know, Gen Z, the popular trend right now that you're seeing, of course, where else on TikTok is they're saying it's pizza for Thanksgiving dinner. They're looking to save a few bucks and back to what John Wise told Brian Sasi, Food Inflation at 22% in the first half, down, still up, but down to 14%, 15% in the second half. So at least a little bit of good news on the Food Inflation. I'm relieved and we got a ways to go there. All right, coming up next, shares of broke lunging in Accenture Trading, following the earnings that we just got. We've got endless reaction. We'll come back.

4701," I always had very tough competition. So it's always kind of been swimming with the sharks, if you think about it that way. The good news for Roku and everyone you just mentioned is that you're seeing all these linear television at dollars move online. You see Netflix with a 699 advertising supported service coming out. So it isn't that the challenge right now is that the money isn't moving online fast enough. And what you're seeing for Roku is the scatter market's kind of drying up. So the short term advertising market for Roku's the challenge. Tom, going back to what you just said there just in terms of the advertising market here clearly a massive challenge in the letter to shareholder Roku saying that we expect these conditions to be temporary, but it is difficult to predict when they will stabilize or rebound any insight or prediction just in terms of when you see this picture potentially improving for Roku. So two things, one, I had at one point thought that political advertising on Hulu on Roku or things of that nature could kind of be a stopgap. But clearly that's not the case. Number two, I think you've pointed the early days of the pandemic, digital advertising went negative in April of 2020. And then once we realized the economy was in better shape than we thought it was in, digital advertising rebounded pretty significantly. So I think at this point in time, when will we have the same conditions, when will we start thinking that the economy's headed the right direction? And that's when I think the digital advertising dollars are returned. And that's when things will improve for Roku. Hopefully that'll be sometime in 23. So there's the win and there's the what is the catalyst, Tom? I know they're selling now smart home products in Walmart. It's got an app with iCloud video recording. How significant is that? Or what else is there that would be the catalyst? That is very significant. So the only challenge for Roku there is if you think about the profitability of the hardware, I've got a TCL Roku TV behind me, a Roku soundbar, things of that nature. Generally speaking, they're selling the hardware at break even. And they make most of their money on the advertising front or on their just their operating system for smart TVs. So I think it's encouraging that they have the brand to extend essentially in the smart home. But that won't be a huge needle mover from a profitability standpoint. Really needs to the advertising research in there to try for profits. So Tom, what's the monetizing story of Roku? The monetizing story is that you have this tremendous opportunity viewership for OTT now is ahead of broadcast TV. It's ahead of cable television. But the advertising spend is still skewed toward linear television, that as that moves over time toward over the top, that's a tremendous opportunity for Roku and for others. And I think that's why I'm still bullish here despite the near-term headwinds. And I'm Steve Loudon, ZFO of Roku leaving the company's Ben with Roku, Ben CFO there since 2015. Roku without Loudon involved. Any concern to you? Hi, Steve's been an excellent CFO. But if you looked at the hires, actually, they made intracorder, they're getting a lot of high priced and high quality talent to come to Roku to advance the programming efforts to advance the proprietary content. So I'll certainly miss working with Steve. I think it's a great opportunity for the next CFO. But the good news is that they're still getting great executives to join. Despite as you pointed out earlier, that the stock's down 75% year to date. You know, I've known their 17% plus here in extended trading. All right, Tom Forte, I always great to have you. Thanks so much for reacting to these earnings release here with us. All right, coming up next, a new index revealing which city is a top emerging housing market in the US? The mayor of that city tells us what makes his town so desirable next.HAEL",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,95,2022-11-02 20:42:51
4702,"ikum The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com collaborate on the emerging housing markets index, which considers battle and return on real estate investment, economic health and quality of life. And with the population just over 70,000 Johnson City Tennessee came out on top. Johnson City Mayor Joe Wise with us now on the economy and the housing market. And good to see you Mr. Mayor in the obvious question is the wagon wheel song by Darius Rucker or number one on the Wall Street Journal emerging markets list. What was a bigger deal there in Johnson City? Well, we've had more time to think about the wagon wheel song, but we certainly find the both to be exciting references, I suppose. Mayor, what do you attribute all this excitement to the fact that people are coming from all over the country? It sounds like having interest in your relatively small city. What's driving that? I think there are number of factors that have contributed to it. You've as a city made a sustained investment in infrastructure and particularly the deployment of direct fiber to every residents and business in our community to provide 10 gig in and it. So that makes it a place that people can work remotely in a time when people are contemplating working remotely. But then alongside of those things are quality of life considerations that were home to East Tennessee State University that offers doctoral programs of medicine, pharmacy and nursing and physical therapy and many other allied and health science fields. And so with that comes the parallel medical community with the local children's hospital at level one trauma center. And so folks can come to Johnson City and find in a relatively modest sized town the resources, the services and the quality of life features and amenities that you might associate with significantly larger cities than Johnson City. Mary, we just had the average price, the median home price in your city up on the screen. 309,000 that's up from.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF-LR8jrf4M,96,2022-11-02 20:47:35
4703," significantly larger cities than Johnson City. Yeah, Mary, we just had the average price, the median home price in your city up on the screen. Now, 379,000 that's up from 350,000 just three months ago, up significantly. On a year over year basis, what do you make of the dynamics that's playing out in the housing market in your city? What we could potentially see to prices here in the coming quarters. Well, that's something we're mindful of. Every good news has some consequences that may not always be favorable. And so we're aware of the potential risk to affordability and potentially the concerns around the quality of life that might be changed if we had a significant influx. And so as a community and as a city, we're making very deliberate efforts to look at growth management and making sure that when when all the dust settles, the things that made Johnson City desirable as a place to live remain true of Johnson City for those who live here now and those who might live here in the future. How did the pandemic actually boost the economy boost the real estate of your town? Well, I think remote work, you know, we began the process of deploying the 10 gig internet through our local energy authority years ago before we knew there would be a pandemic in 2020. And so really we were ready in a capacity for remote workers, particularly long before the culture had an inclination to really be pursuing it the way we've seen over the last several years. And once people returned to office, how do you make sure people stay and don't leave Johnson City? Well, I think part of that is proximity. We're at the crossroads of interstates 26 and 81. We are within about a days drive of virtually everybody in the eastern half of the United States. And so for a lot of professionals, a community like Johnson City provides them the best of both worlds, we're only a few hours from places like Charlotte or Nashville or Atlanta. And so if your job doesn't require you to physically be in a specific location Monday to Friday, which lots of people's jobs do not, this might just be the right fit. Based upon the video I'm seeing sir, I have got to come visit Johnson City Tennessee mayor Joe Wise will be our guest that we will we will come see it. Thanks for being with us. All right, Sean, let's take a look at what's trending after hours. I'm going to take the trip with you. Those pictures look nice, didn't they? Let's do a road show in Johnson City. I like it. I like it. I like it. I'm very proud of all the producers. All right. Let's take a look at some of these after our removers here. We have Roku Qualcomm Etsy booking and Robinhood kicking off with Roku losses. They're pretty dramatic following that much worse than expected. A wider than expected loss. I should say here for the coming quarter. The stock off just around 19% as a result of just the losses quarter may come to 135 million putting that in perspective. That's about three times what analysts were expecting to hear from Roku. Obviously the slowdown that we're seeing in terms of the advertising market having a massive impact on Roku over the last three months. Stock off just around 28% year to date. You're looking at losses of over 76%. The company also saying that it's going to slow hiring as a result of what we're seeing playing out in the broader economy right now. And CFOC of a loud and is going to be leaving Roku next year. Let's take a look at Qualcomm and another mover here moving to the downside off and nearly 6% guidance coming in week. We just talked to Christopher Roland of Susquehanna. He said that it's the worst Qualcomm guidance that he has seen in years rapid weakening in demand elevated inventory a couple headwinds here facing Qualcomm. Fourth quarter revenue that would come in line with expectations 11.39 billion taking a look at the year today performance. You can see the stock off just around a 38%. Let's take a look at Etsy different story here. You're seeing gains of nearly 10% after our strong revenue report there is what's driving the action here up 12% on your your basis. 594.5 million beating the streets estimate of 563 million gross merchant dies sales better than what we're expecting coming in at 3 billion.

4705," Is the record for the highest-selling professional sports team about to fall? That's the question with news at the Washington Commanders' announcement today. Owner Dan Snyder's hired Bank of America's securities to consider, quote, potential transactions involving the franchise. Now, Congress and the NFL continue to investigate Snyder over a toxic work culture, as well as an allegation of sexual misconduct. Snyder has already been fined $10 million by the league. It's set a reportedly paid $750 million for this team in 1999 that today Forbes values at $5.6 billion. And Shana, once you get a name like, oh, let's say Jeff Bezos involved, which I believe is actually a possibility here unlike the previous rumors, you're talking north to $6 billion easy for this team. Yeah, it's going to be interested to see one who is interested in buying this team. Of course, more details just in terms of the sale. Haven't we don't have those yet. So I think that's going to be critical just in terms of identifying a potential buyer. But that value is really incredible. You mentioned the fact that now it's worth Forbes estimates. It's now worth $5.6 billion Snyder own the team, has own the team since $9,880 million for it. That really speaks for Shell to the astronomical rise that we have seen in the value of teams in the NFL. And certainly this getting a lot of attention and it will be interesting to see who exactly gets involved. It will be fun if it was Bezos. It'd be great. Great for the game. I mean, I'll say, obviously, the commanders are my local team. I've been watching them since I was in college back in the 1900s. But a lot of people, like when you look at some of the mixed reactions to this news, some people doing happy dances. A lot of people wondering, why is he even selling? A lot of people thought that Densnider would never sell. Now, it's important to note that they did list in that statement they were exploring potential transactions, ESPN tweeting. It's unclear if this means they're exploring a sale of the franchises a whole or seeking a minority owner. I thought it was interesting that former Washington quarterback RG3 said he tweeted, who wants to be a minority owner of the Washington commanders? I'm down to pay for stake in the team and bring 10 fans along for the ride. So who knows? Who knows where this is going to go still early days? But clearly, a lot of interest in this, right? Certainly early days in Congress is still investigating Densnider, the NFL investigating Snyder for a second time. So the interest is to see how this all plays out. All right, then. I'll do it for us today on Yahoo Finance Live. Be sure to come back tomorrow at 3 p.m. Eastern Time for all your coverage leading up to and after the closing bell. We'll see you then.

4710,"? Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live this morning. Major averages here in the US are lower across the board off of the session lows, but even within these first 11 minutes of trade, you're still seeing them in the red for more. Let's get on over to the Wi-Fi Interactive where Jared Blycker joins us with a little bit more color on today's tape. Yeah, unfortunately. Color is red. The words right out of my mind. Sorry. That's fine. Powell really meant it. He really did. We keep saying that, but let me show you the three day price action in the S&P 500, because we are in a downtrend. Once again, that's off about 3.5% the NASDAQ taking it on the chin a little bit more down 5%. And let's take a longer term view of the S&P 500. This is over a few months here, three months, and here is the last peak that we had. Here is the last low. This is the low of the year, and we are right back down here. Pretty big day yesterday. And I think it's instructive to see what's happening in the bond market. We didn't really get the huge reaction yesterday, but overnight in this morning, we're seeing huge movement, a shift upwards in the yield curve. Now the five years up, 17 basis points. That is a huge amount. Here is a 14 basis point, 13, 30 year up a little bit less. That's nine basis points. And a 13 week T bill yield, closely matching the Fed funds rate. That's a very short end of the curve. That is flat right now, although it did punch to new relative highs yesterday. And the US dollar, we haven't talked about, or I haven't talked about this in a few days, that is racing higher once again. Now these are 20 year highs in the dollar index, and we've gone through it. It is influenced mainly by European. The Euro and also the pound, but I'll tell you what, here's another currency, Bitcoin. Even Bitcoin could barely get off the dime yesterday, although it's not selling off that much today. So maybe there's a ray of hope here. WTI crude futures, we're going to get some more futures acted in a little bit, about $88 a barrel, nothing big going on there. Now here's a sector action for today, energy in the forefront, but I want to give us a two day view so we can really see what has happened, what the market is pricing in in terms of the Fed. XLK, that is a tech sector that is down the most 5% followed by communication services. And real estate, we didn't even get to the futures market. Natural gas here in a downtrend of New England worried about not having enough supplies for the winter. Europe also worried about not getting enough LNG. Nevertheless, we can see that market down 3% today. GARB BLEKER Y E M E E Baret CO.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,1,2022-11-03 13:45:24
4711," New England worried about not having enough supplies for the winter. Europe also worried about not getting enough LNG. Nevertheless, we can see that market down 3% today. Jarred Blyckery on fire at the board. Appreciate it. All right, big stat of the day. We're up to our attention. Our executive producer, Vouncing and Caval, pretty shocking when you think about this one. Actually, Apple finished Wednesday session with a $2.31 trillion market cap, a corn kiyow finance data, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta were worth it, combined $2.3 trillion. Meta's meltdown, of course, this year, back or helping to drive that underperformance. They are big, Apple-O indeed, the winner. All right, Twinkie maker, Hostess, baked up another good quarter. Hostess, CEO, Andy Callan, stops bar for chat next. Cheers of Hostess brands are on the move. After the snack brand reported, it's 11th straight quarter of over 9% revenue growth and said higher prices count to 40% of the rise. Hostess, Brantzio, Andy Callan joins us now to discuss, and you always nice to see here. We're sure getting some pretty good reads on consumers back out there traveling and moving around. What are you seeing in your brand within convenience stores? Yeah, well, you know, the breath of our portfolio is pretty wide across all channels. Convenience stores certainly an important channel for us. We do see a lot of resiliency. You know, we have an on-the-go or high impulse category. Consumers are back traveling. We're in two spaces, both with macro trends and tailwinds behind us for our sweet baked goods. And one of them is indulgent and permissible snacking of which our portfolio and Twinkie fits the bill. Convenience is very resilient. Consumers are still traveling and they're going through whether it's around the home more. When they're in the, around the home more, they're traveling around the home more. That's good for our business and when they're driving more, that's good for our business. So we're really seeing a lot of resiliency including in our convenience channel, which point of sale grew above.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,2,2022-11-03 13:49:19
4712," around the home more. That's good for our business. And when they're driving more, that's good for our business. So we're really seeing a lot of results, including in our convenience channel, which point of sale grew above 13% of this last quarter. And I'm also curious, Andy Hage, Julie here, which categories, which subcategories are doing the best right now? What's sort of the hottest product out there? Well, our core icons always do well. You know, we're pre-pads. And most of our portfolio is prepared for snacking and our two iconic brands, or iconic brand hostess with all of its subbrands as well as our Whartman portfolio, which is a little bit more than 10% of portfolio are both performing well. By the way, Whartman point of sale was up 28.8%. So we see indulgent snacking on total, a really continuing half trail winds. That's been before the pandemic, and that's now today. And we really have a pure play snacking portfolio. So we're well positioned to capitalize on that growth with the assets to achieve that growth. We see morning breakfast continuing the growth. That's a $5.8 billion segment. We recently launched Bound Show that really attacks the lunch box occasion at 6.2 billion in total consumer occasions. So this indulgent snacking is really moving across the board in the faces of we compete. Our Whartman portfolio, by the way, is the number one share within sugar free for cookies, an $8 billion total category, but it's growing and more than twice a rate of total cookies. So we were really positioned well for macro consumer trends. Andy, you've put up several good quarters in a row now. What is it about a twinkie or the other products that they're selling? There are other snacks out there. Had you survey folks on why they're gravitating to your brands? Well, there's a couple of things. First of all, even during times of recession or when times are good, consumers reach for permissible and indulgent snacks that they feel are at an accessible price point. We're maniacal and making sure we provide the right value to our consumers when they have. The other thing that we really spent a lot of time over the last three or four years is focusing on our product quality. So when consumers come and they want an indulgent snack, they want it to be a good reward. They don't need a lot, but they need it in a portion controlled form. We've invested in product quality, our penetration in households is going up. And but also we're accessing and adding two times buyer to our category, to our franchise, to our host's business, as greater than twice the rate of the rest of the category. That means when consumers come and try us, they'd like it and they're coming and repeating. So we're doing all of the fundamentals at right. I don't top of that are increasing advertising to build the gap between our aided awareness and top of mind awareness and our innovation. And you get a recipe for 11 straight quarters above 90% growth. Andy, you talked about holding the line on value. At the same time, you did take price, right? Because that's one of the things, or the main thing that was responsible for the revenue bump here. So how do you calculate that a and b, what happens to price now going forward? Are you gonna keep on raising? As we sit here today, what we see, especially as we close out the years, we only talk about 23, we have the pricing in the marketplace to obviously deliver our raised guidance. We raised our revenue and profit of top and bottom line guidance for the full year of FY 22. This is the way we look at it. We take the value that we deliver to consumers, very serious. And then we also have a suite of tools that we love. We utilize to leverage the efficiency of which we deliver then we balance both of those. So in the quarter, despite having a 20% pricing that moves through the consumer, our gross margin still contracted a little less than a hundred basis points. We believe over time given our revenue growth management initiatives, our productivity initiatives, and when needed, when we get this high of inflation, it was above 18% in the quarter, as a last resort we do move the pricing. So that's why pricing's in the marketplace now. We think we have the right balance going forward, but given our agility and our continued focus on the fundamentals, if needed, we're in a position to do that. We don't believe we are today. We are committed to, by the way, of recovering our gross margins over time. And as a reminder, our growth algorithm is to a mid-single-digit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,3,2022-11-03 13:53:20
4713," of recovering our gross margins over time. And as a reminder, our growth algorithm is to a mid-single-digit top-line growth at 5% to 7% EBITDA growth and 7% and 9% EPS growth, which we believe will continue even from this going forward, despite our incredible performance of the last three years, lead to top tier shareholder return. Andy, real quick, before I let you go, what is your one big product that you're going to launch next year? Anything you could take us inside the C-suite? Well, we're in the process right now of launching our bouncer. So bouncer's as our focus, it targets a lunchbox occasion. It reimagines some of our icons like Twinkies and Ding Dons and Donets. It puts it in a poppable form, that a two-by-poppable form, and it's perfect for the lunchbox or any carried occasion. Retailer acceptance has been extremely positive. We're very proud of it. We're ramping up the consumer advertising here as we move into Q4. We're very enthusiastic. Obviously, consumers will tell, but we're obviously very positive about that. We have a great track record of innovation that we've built over the last several years. Bouncer's. All right. Hostess Francio and E. Calahan, thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it. I always good to see you. Appreciate you, Heather. Yeah, you too. Let's take a look at some economic data just coming out. S&P services, PMI, purchasing managers, index showing a sharper contraction than the initial read for the month of October here, coming in at 47.8, the composite PMI coming out at 48.2. Remember anything below 50 does signal contraction here. And it's interesting because the manufacturing data that we got was better than estimated. So, the services contraction is interesting that we are seeing here. And the folks at S&P Global saying the latest data signals, a modest contraction and business activity across the service sector, lower new orders, panelists attributed weak client demand to the impact of inflation and interest rates on increased client hesitancy and more frequent order post-pomance. Indeed, we're seeing a lot of that abounding. We're getting the ISM numbers on the same front in just a bit. Coming up, sticking with food, Brian Sons is going to help us digest the latest quarter from Papa John's, let's next.

4715," everyone. Welcome back to how finance I'm Brian Saazie alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Investors are still digesting conflicting commentary from Fed Chief Jerome Powell on Wednesday, which hammered stocks into the close. And today we're sifting through a host of EPS reports, everything from a disaster like Roku to surprising profits at Robinhood. Right now we're seeing all three major indices deeply in the red. But Julie, let's get over to you. Some breaking news on the comment. Yeah, we have the services gauged from the Instavers Supply Management coming in at the slowest pace since May of 2020. 54.4 was the reading 56.7 was what it was in September. So it declined there. Obviously, this is a little better than estimated. 53.3 is what economists was looking for. And above 50 does signal expansion. So unlike the S&P Global Read that we got just a moment ago, this is a different slicing and dicing. And it's one that looks a little bit better. We did see measure of business activity within the index declining to a five month low. The new orders component of this falling to the lowest level since June. And the prices paid in index part of this is increased and does remain elevated. So still seeing not a terrible picture here, but not a fantastic one either. That prices paid component to 70.7 from 68.7. So all of this indicates that we still have expansion in the services part of the economy, but we're seeing a slowdown in that expansion. And look, you saw the market come back just a little bit. This is a market that may just wants to reward any data that misses. Maybe. I saw that. I knew you could do that. No, so. And we should also mention we just got mortgage rates in the last few moments as well. The new data from Freddie Mac showing that we saw now a redip under 7%. It was above 7% last week when we got this 30 year number. Now it is 6.95% that is the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac. I mean, whether it's a little bit above 7 or a little bit below. As the man says, it's too damn high as the man says about the rent anyway. So watching that as well as a continuing headwind. Indeed. And we're taking a look at the major averages to see how they're reacting to the economic data, the Dow Jones industrial average about 33 minutes into trade is lower by 324, 327 ish points there. One point to the downside right now, the Nasdaq composite, you're seeing that down by about 1.7% on the day, 177 points in negative territory. And the S&P 500, you're also taking a look at some red on the screen there. It's down to the tune of nearly 50 points, 1.3% in the red. Let's take a look at some of the other major moves that we're tracking here on the day. And I wanted to pull up a pharma and the broader healthcare space as well here. And perhaps I'll put this on an equal market rating just so we could actually see some of the names here. Sigma had reported on the day that reported earlier this morning, moving higher on the earnings report by about 1.5% and of course we've broken down some of the other major earnings reports that have come out today as well to the tune of Moderna you heard that earlier. And so now let's just take a quick look at where some of the sector activity is continuing to move. It's going to be deeper in the red from when we last checked in on it. Take a look at, and this is over the past two days. So let's just put this on the right scale here. Intraday, we are seeing technology sector now down 2.4% at this point in time. And so continuing to see that decline or energy just barely creeping into the green there up by a fraction of a percent, 3.10% there. Well the Fed, staying the course and its aggressive fight against inflation with another rate hike. So let's move, set to further dampen markets and make mortgages and other loans less attractive. For a look at how this is going to affect your personal investments, let's turn to Catherine George, wealth stream advisors, senior advisor. Alright, Catherine, take us into your reaction yesterday after the commentary from.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,6,2022-11-03 14:06:24
4716," Your personal investments, let's turn to Catherine George, wealth stream advisors, senior advisor. All right, Catherine, take us into your reaction yesterday after the commentary from Fed Chair Jay Powell, the decision from the FOMC and how the markets are digesting this as well. I mean, we've been seeing this for a while, right? They've let us know that this rate height was coming and the market price that in a while ago. You know, maybe there's some short-term noise here, but we were expecting this. Maybe we weren't expecting to hear that in 2023, that could be additional rate rises, which is why the market is probably reacting the way that it is. But, you know, we've been through this economic cycle before. It's not that unexpected and the stock market, the bond market will all come back. And it's actually a great thing for the bond market, but, you know, happy to go into stocks, bonds, whatever you're most curious about. Well, let's talk about the bond market. Let's linger on the bond market, if you will, a little bit. It hasn't been a great time for the bond market thus far this year, right? And you've got both stocks and bonds that have been losing on the year, which is an unusual occurrence. As you said, you know, we've seen this environment before. That particular piece of it is not so common. So how do you navigate through that for your clients? You're right. And, you know, in the bond market, it's a little bit different in the stock market and that the price today doesn't matter all that much as long as you stay invested. You know, the bonds we bought last year become less valuable because a new bond will pay you a higher coupon rate. But as long as you hold on to that bond that we bought last year, you're still gonna get the same coupon payment that they promised you and you're still gonna get your principal back in maturity. So, you know, that's the one thing. But once those bonds start to mature, you're actually gonna be able to buy much more attractive bonds at higher rates and it's gonna be, you know, much healthier for your overall portfolio, especially for those investors that have a decent portion of bonds, let's say you're headed for retirement or you're in retirement, you're actually gonna start to be able to earn a decent return on that portion of the portfolio whereas, you know, the past 10 years, we haven't seen that. So it's actually a good, good future outlook for the bond market. It's just a waiting game. Catherine, as we're seeing today, the market does not like when the Fed comes out here and suggests that rate hikes are going to continue for the foreseeable future. Having said that, is there anywhere, anywhere an investor can hide out in this volatile environment? You know, hiding out is, it's a tricky thing. So the first thing I'd say is don't overreact, right? Stay invested, keep your stocks and bonds where they are and don't overreact. But I think the biggest thing is the cash, right? We're finally able to earn some return on our cash. If you're uncomfortable with putting any other extra cash in the market right now, then make sure you're getting some sort of a return on that. You know, online bank accounts are offering about 3% right now just to sit in cash. And Treasury bills, I mean, you get a six month treasury bill for 4.5% right now. That's a very liquid, you know, market. 4.5% is great. So that's one option. But really, if you're feeling like you can take a little bit of risk right now and you have extra cash on top of your emergency reserve, and maybe a little bit extra if you have a job that you're worried about in a pending recession. But if you have some extra cash, stocks are on sale. You know, it's actually a really good time to put some long-term money away as long as you can stomach kind of the ups and downs of the market. You know, even with today's move lower, we're not sitting at the lows in terms of this larger kind of downtrend that we've seen for the major averages and the markets more broadly here. Do you believe that a recession has been priced in at least at the bottom end of where we've kind of seen the activity take place over the past few months? Yeah, so I can tell you that I think everyone is expecting a recession and that's lights likely priced in. Are we at the bottom? I have no idea. But if we look back to 2008, 2009, you know, behind the time the recession was actually announced, the stock market was already on the way back up. So, you know, recessions are back, we're looking, and as we all know, stock markets are forward looking. So while they're related, you know, if the recession comes out in three months, that doesn't mean our portfolios are gonna drop another 20%. You know, everyone is starting thinking about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,7,2022-11-03 14:10:43
4717," So while they're related, you know, if the recession comes out in three months, that doesn't mean our portfolios are going to drop another 20%. You know, everyone is already thinking about this. It's been in the news for the past year. So yeah, I think it's already priced in. I just, you know, we just don't know if it's going to drop a little bit more than any time. Catherine George, Wealthstream, Adviser, Senior Advisor. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks for having me. All right, before we head to break, let's check in on shares of Elf Cosmetics after the four quarter from Estee Lauder on Wednesday. Elf put up, put on its best face on the third quarter topping profit estimates by 20 cents on the back higher prices and consumers trading down to cheaper lip gloss and face scrubs. Company lifted its full-year sales guides to 22% to 24%, 24% from 14% to 16% previously. Jeffrey Zannels, Ashley Helgans, notes that Elf is gaining shelf space at Target and Walmart ahead of the holiday shopping season as well. Elf on the shelf. Elf on the shelf. Go up. Very nice. That's a home run, Brad. Coming up, we'll speak with the CFL of Cheg. On the back of that, our ring's report is the stock price exploding higher. Let's next. Let's get down to business now. Take a look at some of the other headlines we're watching. Food delivery service Instacart will pay out its first company wide cash bonus in December. That's going to the Wall Street Journal. That move aims to boost employee morale among its corporate team during the holidays following the company's decision to delay its public offering, the mid-tightening economic conditions. The move also signals a shift in its employee retention plans. The San Francisco-based company has historically given out equity rewards to keep workers.

The woman who identifies as Hispanic claims she was subject to racial discrimination by basis of staff and also forced to work long hours in unsanitary conditions without rest or breaks, which led her and other Housekeeper, she says in the suit, to develop urinary tract infections. WADA has worked for wealthy and high-profile families for 18 years with no issues according to her lawyers. Meanwhile, lawyers representing basis as LLCs say the claims have no merit. Former CBS CEO Leslie Moonvez and CBS owner Paramount reached a $30.5 million settlement with the Office of New York's Attorney General, LaTisha James. The state alleged that Moonvez concealed multiple sexual assault allegations from regulators, shareholders and the public for months, Moonvez stepped down in 2018 following those allegations. Paramount will pay $28 million to the state, 22 million of which will go back to CBS shareholders and 6 million to strengthen mechanisms for investigating sexual harassment claims. Moonvez himself must pay $2.5 million, which will also go to CBS shareholders. Brad? Thanks so much, Julie. While homework helper, Jay, they aced their third quarter and boosted its full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA as college enrollment begins to stabilize here a little bit more. Chuck, Chief Financial Officer, Andy Brown joins us now. Andy, thanks so much for taking the time and helping us run through the quarter. If you got to think of one catalyst that really sticks out to you within the business from this past period, what is that? Yeah, it's been an interesting 12 months for Cheg and as you had mentioned, things like what we're seeing in the headwinds that we saw maybe a year ago have now stabilized. As far as catalyst with respect to Cheg, I mean, one of the things that we have been doing is pushing what I'll call offering our premium price option. We call the Cheg Study Pack and we continue to see a great momentum there adding more value to the study pack and more of our students are taking that premium price option and that's had a very nice impact on not just our revenue growth but our earnings. As you saw in our report, we blew through our earnings and we raised our guidance quite significantly. When we think of the past two years, it's really changed the way that a lot of colleges, universities might think about where people can be educated from, how they can be educated, what type of opportunities that create for Cheg even in a Renaissance moment for education or kind of a new normal that we're heading towards? Well, you know, when we came to Cheg, our CEO came 13, 14 years ago. I'm now in my 13th year here. We were a textbook renter, but our vision was always that we would offer many types of services online and we used to use the term and continue to use the term that you bet on the inevitable. And the inevitable is that more and more things are going to be done online. And so we embarked upon offering subscription services, homework help services that were exactly how students wanted and that is their relatively inexpensive, their online, their available 24 by 7 and those are the types of services that students expect and we continue to deliver. Whereas, you know, the traditional college experience was all of the help was on campus, but that's not the modern student today. I mean, I think a lot of people don't realize is that, you know, you may think of a traditional four year residential school, but many of the many students in today's environment are actually part time students, they're commuting into community colleges. They don't have the ability to get help, you know, at the institution. And so we provide that opportunity to learn anywhere, anytime, any place. And Andy, you guys are also expanding more into things that have nothing to do with traditional students, that is college students, right? You're looking more to the corporate world as well. I know you have a partnership that allows companies to give their employees language learning. How big a part of your business is that and how much are you looking to that business for growth?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,9,2022-11-03 14:19:14
4719," to give their employees language learning. How big a part of your business is that and how much are you looking to that business for growth? Yeah, so you're talking about our skills platform. And we've believed for a long period of time that, you know, while most of what we do today or have historically has been academic learning, we believe skills-based learning will play a much larger role, is playing a much larger role and will continue to play a larger role in the future. So to your point, we have several skills products. One is what we call our thinkful line of services and then more recently language learning with BUSU. And we do work with a company called Guild that then delivers those services to large corporations like at Chipotle and a Wal-Mart and so forth. And more recently, and what we announced on our earnings call is that we were going to be including our language skills services through Guild starting in 2023. So we do believe, you know, when you imagine check, I'll call it two to three years from now, skills will be a much bigger part of our revenue and contribution. And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw an adjusted EBITDA in the positive. Where is that coming from? How are you guys achieving that? And what are some of your targets on that front? Yeah, so we've always focused on profitable growth. And that's always something that we've talked about at our company and as you can see, we continue to do that. We had a nice beat in Q4. But inherently in our model, because we've got a fairly fixed content cost and much of our users come through unpaid sources, it's just natural that as we scale, our margins will scale. And I'll just remind everybody, I mean, we're profitable across every line. It's not just EBITDA, it's not just non-GAP. We're GAP profitable. So we do believe that we'll continue. We're not going to put a cap on where that would be. We're not at a steady state profitability yet. We do believe that as we scale, we will continue to increase our margins. Andy, while we have you, this has been a significant year, perhaps the most significant that I can remember in terms of student loan debt relief and kind of the conversation to advance the cost of college and reforming the high expenses that families and individuals incur. Perhaps from the Cheg Lens, you can give us your read through moving forward from here. Where some of these costs can start coming down, given that Cheg was one of those platforms that ultimately can reduce the costs on the book front that were so extensive for a lot of college goers and education seekers. Yeah, so it is painful. And I think this is more of a, it pains me to see college students going to college taking on large debt, but then are unavailable to actually pay it off. And that's what you're seeing. So does that disconnect on the ROI? In many cases, not all cases, but in many cases, the ROI. And I think that is a big part of what, as a society, we need to fix. What is the ROI of going to college? So we don't get into these situations where students fundamentally can't pay that debt off, which is real simple. There wasn't an ROI on that particular student's education. So I think that's the fix that we need to do. And that still hasn't been accomplished. Andy Brown, thanks so much for being here. Cheg's Chief Financial Officer, appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, retail, round up, we'll break down some more earnings from Under Armour, Etsy and Crocs. All of them in the green. Look at that. That's on the other side of the break. Otter that comes from Dunn,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,10,2022-11-03 14:23:41

4721," Crocs has continued to run away not just during the pandemic, but among sentiment even post pandemic as people are Getting back into even some of the more kind of social constructs that they had pre-pandemic Crocs has been it's had some staying power quite frankly and the specific partnerships that they've been able to drum up Whether that be with different brands. I think they had one with peeps They had one with Justin Bieber as well, and so all of that considered that's continued to pay dividends for them over time and And I'm getting the boots you heard it here first. I think they just might be for women I can't I'm on the side. I can't tell but I don't think any of their stuff is No, gender Yeah, okay, most of it is units. I mean, look what I mean. I am I have been seeing some sales stuff on the site I have to say so that's something important to note because You know, I didn't have a chance to look at their inventory numbers full disclosure, but up 100 million, but they've definitely There definitely have been some sales stuff on there, so that's something to note. Yeah, and just to put a number on that direct to consumer comparable sales That was up 18.2% as I was able to log back into my computer. Oh, let's also take a look at under armor shares here on the day Are they protecting this house? Yes, they are. All right. The only way is through it's up by about 15 16% right now The athletic wear company posted it slightly better than expected second quarter results But cut back its guidance citing the stronger dollar and a quote more challenging retail environment It's challenging indeed. You're taking a look at the actuals versus the estimates on your screen and turn around had to start Sometime, but it's not a full turn around. I didn't see really any signs of a turn around This is maybe this was the peloton turn around with the the green shoots Maybe Barry McCarthy should write this company's I'll let her to as well But look they came out lower their guidance and one of the biggest concerns is holiday season in retail is all the inventory Sitting at various stores and one of the most promotional brands in the store right now remains under armor And it's just not what this brand was founded on I remember saving up a lot of money to buy my first Moisture wicking under armor shirt. I had to pay full price. It was a six or seven years ago Maybe even longer than that, but still you go now to TJ Maxx You go to Marshall's this stuff is on sale 10 20 bucks a pop well and their inventory was up by 29% so that You know, but that's in line with what we've seen from others They did cut the forecast as you mentioned, but that forecast cut was largely expected analysts were saying they got to cut the forecast So I guess their acknowledgement of reality was a good thing Also really surprising here Asia Pacific sales up to 7% like who else had Asia Pacific sales I'm getting basketball. Yeah, yeah, they've been sending Steph Curry there every single summer to do a Grassroots just boots on the ground, but still given how shut down things have been there and given what we've been hearing from other companies That's been surprising remember they still don't have a permanent CEO by the way remember Patrick first left This has always been Kevin Planck's house you cover under armor too is yeah as a while even when Patrick first was in there I mean it's very much Kevin Planck's baby his ship He may not be running a day a day, but you know he sends an email you're getting it done right he was steering it And I think for what under armor has gone up against and continues to go up against This is not going to get any easier for them and so continuing we had to have The nostalgia factor that you were mentioning a moment ago everybody remembers their first under armor experience I still have it used my life. I'm used to this shirt to play softball You know it helped me recover a lot faster At least that's what I told myself and then I hit better and I threw the ball further it was amazing, bro It was that aura that you take on but still carrying on I'm wearing it underneath the shirt And so it's really Let's go to the Julie Hymn trade here at she shares of surging After its third quarter earnings beat estimates the e-commerce platform also issued up Be cute for guidance of 700 to 700 to 780 million versus expected almost 750 million Julie that pretty good conference call I think the street was really positioned for something bad from Etsy and they didn't get it Yeah, I think there were position for bad from all three of these companies probably and that's why maybe you're seeing Paws is such a positive reaction to them. I mean Etsy which has been challenged This year certainly with the stock chart What's interesting here is if you look across the board the marketplace revenue was up to services revenue was also up And that's something that the company has really been pushing its services to its sellers as a reason for the Distate on the platform because we're call Etsy is competing with the likes of Amazon when you're talking about these small sellers Amazon has really tried to court them and Etsy's tried to hold on to them by offering what they think is a better",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,12,2022-11-03 14:32:23
4722," But the likes of Amazon, when you're talking about these small sellers, Amazon has really tried to court them, and Etsy's tried to hold on to them by offering what they think is a better experience. Yeah, down in the gross merchandise sales, though, that was lower by about 3.3 percent year over year. However, they did see some growth in that marketplace revenue. They saw growth in services revenue as you were mentioning a moment ago, and that directly dovetailed into that gross profit. That rose by about, looks like 10 percent, a little over 10 percent in this most recent quarter as well. Everyone coming up, Qualcomm, taking a hit from its weak guidance and implemented hiring freeze. We're going to break down those results next. Brightening. This is the most insanlar growth time ever on the screen. I think sincerely, it's been more than 5%. What it looks like. I'm sorry. But the biggest win for us was going to help us react. We're continuing to watch shares of Qualcomm this morning after the company slashed its forecast for smartphone shipments and gave a gloomy sales outlook for more let's bring in technologists research president chief analyst bob odonald bob great to speak with you as always here all right we come out of this quarter and really kind of back out what they had to say and and really look through the the core fundamentals of the business but also the trends in the headwinds that are persisting for them what really sticks out to you. Well look Qualcomm has been on a journey of changing into a much broader company for several years now really but we're really starting to see it come into play but the fact of the matter is 56% of the revenue this last quarter was for smartphones right that's still a huge chunk and that's why there's been so much focus on you know their numbers and their expectations but as with the PC market we're seeing that the smartphone market is is taking this post pandemic dip and it's going to be difficult there's a bunch of inventory out there just as again we've seen with the PC guys there's a lot of similarities in terms of what's been happening out there on that front but you know they did have that automotive analog",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,13,2022-11-03 14:37:08
4723," bunch of inventory out there just as again, we've seen with the PC guys. There's a lot of similarities in terms of what's been happening out there on that front. But, you know, they did have that automotive analyst day a couple of weeks ago in New York talking about all the automotive business they have. Of course, they're providing the chipset for Meta's new VR headsets. They're doing a number of areas because what they're able to do is leverage the technology they have, particularly around things like modems and RF. Stuff that's really, really hard to do as Apple is learning and apply that in a number of places. They've had this in automotive for a long time, you know, what's called the telematic systems. And they've been driving that for a long time. Now, as they have more advanced processors that originally started in the smartphone market, they're bringing that into the automobile market. And, you know, as we move to software-defined cars and much more capabilities, Qualcomm is saying, hey, look, you've been working with us for a long time anyway. We're a natural entree for you to bring some of these advanced capabilities to digital cockpit, to the Snapdragon RIDE, format that they have or platform, excuse me, that they have. So, you know, it's this typical thing with semiconductors. Right now, short-term is pretty tough for just about all of them. Long-term, those companies that have really diversified themselves, I think have a really strong growth story. Qualcomm is one among them. AMD, of course, similar type of situation. They just reported earlier this week as well. What is this correction in the level of inventory? When does that ease and start to improve? You know, Brian, I mean, they've said, you know, in the call, they said it's going to be several quarters to get through that inventory. Again, we're hearing relatively similar types of things from some of the other big semi-focus. So, I think that's just a reflection of the fact that, again, a lot of people are slowing down the pace at which they, with which they upgrade their smartphones. I mean, let's think about it. We're not seeing a whole lot of innovative smartphone designs. You know, everything is much more incremental. We've had a few big jumps with foldables, but they're still a small piece of the market. You know, iPhones are evolving, but again, modest pace. So, there isn't that overwhelming sense that I have to have the latest new great smartphone. Now, there's still plenty of upside for 5G smartphones. You know, that's, of course, where Qualcomm's strength has typically been. So, I think you're going to see them continue to develop that market, but it's just going to be at a slower pace and people are going to have to get used to that in the short term, remembering that there's still those long-term opportunities. Bob, hey, it's Julie here. I have to wonder about the implications for Apple, right? Because we keep getting these signs that smartphone sales are going to weaken. This is, Qualcomm is just the latest. Apple shares today are down more than 3%. And I'm curious how long you think this pain is going to last for the smartphone market? I think it could be a while. I mean, I think we could be, again, drawing analogies to the PC market, maybe not declining quite as rapidly, because PCs grew even more during the pandemic, and therefore, unfortunately, are falling even more. But smartphones did reasonably well during the pandemic, but again, people are like, OK, I'm good for a while. And the average lifetimes we've seen growing over time, and now that's really kind of hitting. And when people have to make a decision, you know, if things get tough from a macro-acronomic perspective, they're like, look, my phone is good. And it's getting easier to get them repaired if you just want to replace the glass, of course, because people do that all the time. So I just don't feel like there's this compelling desire until we start to see something really dramatically different in the smartphone market. And again, we have seen foldables like the Galaxy Fold and some other things, but they're still small. Eventually, I think Apple may do something like that. That'll add some pizzazz to the market, but I still think we're a few years off. But to Apple's challenges that you mentioned, you know, they bought Intel's modem IP. That's the chip that allows you to do the communications with the cellular network. And it's hard stuff. I mean, RF is the radio frequency stuff is very difficult. There's really only two companies in the world that do a well. It's Paul Common Media Tech. And Apple had plans to do their own modem. And they still will. It's just that now they've already delayed it a year. And who knows if it goes even longer. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,14,2022-11-03 14:41:09
4724," And Apple had plans to do their own bottom and they still will. It's just not they've already delayed it a year and who knows if it goes even longer. So that's upside for Qualcomm that nobody expected to happen. So good for them, but offset of course by the fact that the overall market is still declining. If the metaverse takes office Qualcomm a net beneficiary. Yes, it is it is. I mean, because there are, you know, when we think about at least the near term metaverse, I mean longer term we'll see, but near term, you know, they've got the chip that's powering the headsets. Again, there are a couple of other competitors but Qualcomm by far is more advanced in that regard. But you know, I mean, look at it now even, right? I mean, they put that in their IOT revenue and it's still a small fraction of Qualcomm's revenue. So even if it explodes, it becomes a reasonable percentage of Qualcomm's revenue, but nothing compared to smartphones, which to me is just another example and reason why I think the metaverse as some people have touted it is a long way off. Bob O'Donnell, President, Chief Analyst, a technic analysis research. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks. Appreciate you having me. Birken is smack in the middle of trying to reclaim the flame. We'll see how that's playing out with restaurant brand CO Jose Sil. That's next. Checking in on the king. The Burger King that is parent company restaurant brand saw global same-star sales climb 9% led by 10% rise at Burger King and strong international growth restaurant brand CO. Jose Sil is fresh with us off his earnings call. Jose happy national sandwich day to you my friend. We're talking earlier on in the show. Why a lot of companies like yours, the burger players are doing better than the pizza guys. Why do you think that's the case? Well, Brian, thanks for having me. Great to be here on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,15,2022-11-03 14:45:36
4725," on in the show, why a lot of companies like yours, the burger players are doing better than the pizza guys. Why do you think that's the case? Well, Brian, thanks for having me. Great to be here, especially on National Sandwich Day, also on our earnings day. By the way, we have a Popeyes, by one, get one free chicken sandwich during this important national holiday. Look, we're excited, obviously, with the momentum in our brands and our business, and we saw some really strong performance in the quarter that we shared earlier in earnings. I think our brands are well positioned in all moments in time. We have great food, great beverages, at Burger King, Thames, Popeyes, and Firehouse. And we provide great experiences, digital has become a bigger part of our business. We have various service modes, delivery, drive-through, dine-in, curbside, and some restaurants. And we do so with our digital capabilities at a great value. So it's a compelling offer. It's why we grow on frequency, and it's the core element of our business model that's so exciting. And we do so in good times, and especially, and certainly, during challenging times. So I think we're well positioned to benefit from tailwinds in difficult moments because of the business model, the great franchisees that we have, and the amazing food and beverages that we serve in our brands. Even as your customer base might be looking for value within this kind of error, this environment right now, where do you still need to, or have you had to pass through price increases to customers that are looking for not just a good meal, but also a good price steel, if you will. Like I think you have to start with the acknowledgement that consumers are generally value-driven. Value for money has always been a key driver of decision-making in our category, in the quick service or limited service restaurant space. That doesn't mean discounting necessarily, but they're always looking for good value, which means they're looking for taste, quality, sometimes quantity, and overall experience for what they pay. And I think we're very well positioned, as I mentioned earlier, to deliver consistently on those expectations from consumers. Today, consumers, and it's slightly different than the US and Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. But broadly speaking, there's a ton of concern around the macro, right? The inflation, food at home, grocery prices are kind of outpacing inflation away from home in the food category. Gas prices are up, energy prices, especially in Europe are quite steeply increasing. We haven't seen any trade down or trade out of our category, but we know that there is pressure in the consumer and our business does well. Our brands do well when we serve great tasting products, great beverages at a good price, even if we're having to raise prices to address some inflation. And what we do on that is that we make sure we understand CPI, and we know for the US, it's been around 8% for Canada, it's just under 7%, and slowing down a bit. We look at food away from home and at home inflation, we look at a number of different data points. We talk to consumers, and then we take price to address input cost, but we do so in a way that's measured to ensure that we don't chase away our very important customers that are the key to our success alongside our franchisees. Jose, just given those pressures on consumers, do you need a six item dollar menu? Well, look, I think having value and having a balanced menu is always important, Brian. We have a core offering, which is fundamental to success is why people come to Burger King Popeyes, Tins and Firehouse, they know those core items, and they're there consistently for those core items. We have premium offerings, which allow for indulgence and for those treats from time to time. And then we have value as an everyday proposition in each of our brands. We've had dollar menus or kind of entry level alacard menus, I don't know if dollar is any longer the relevant price point, but having an everyday entry level price point product that consumers can go to alacard and or to bundle, I think, is an important aspect of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,16,2022-11-03 14:49:34
4726," Every day, entry-level price point product that consumers can go to, Alacart and, or to Bundle, I think is an important aspect of being abroad based and very thoughtful restaurant business. And that's something that we continue to explore. And look at our teams who are working on quality and product offerings at the right price that allow for customers to come in more frequently and enjoy our brands day in and day out. There was two and a half percent net restaurant growth when you think about the franchisees. What are you hearing from franchisees right now and even potential franchisees in different markets and how they're potentially looking to get into business with restaurant brands? Yeah, we have a lot of excitement around growth in our business and fundamentally restaurant brands and our four amazing iconic brands are growth brands and growth businesses. Yeah, we've got a lot of room for growth internationally for all four of our brands, even Burger King that has north of 12,000 restaurants in international markets. We've got a lot of room for growth. We think domestically with firehouse, with Popeyes, Tins in the US is beginning to rev up their engines from a growth standpoint. And obviously, firehouse has a huge runway domestically as well. Franchisees are excited. They're obviously concerned in near term with the impacts that we're seeing in inflation, commodity costs. That translates not only to food costs but also to construction costs. There's always a challenge around getting permitting and the process of getting approvals to move forward with new restaurants sites. But we have a healthy pipeline. We have a lot of interest from existing franchisees as well as new franchisees to develop our brands domestically and internationally. And we continue to work with our partners to move those pipelines along and continue to grow our businesses. And over time, we think we're on our way to our 40,000 restaurant goal with restaurant brands over the next several years. Jose, I have 10 seconds left and this is National Sandwich Day. Somebody's been out there touting their sales gains in any smack talk form. Look, our brands are awesome. We have firehouse, Burger King, Tins and Popeyes. I think they're the best in each of their categories in Burger, Chicken, Coffee and Sandwich. And I'll let the customers decide who the best brands are. My focus is building a great team working with our franchisees and delivering profitable opportunities for growth across the across our four brands. You're too nice, Jose. You're too nice. Just too nice. Jose is a customer of Popeyes. I can say on this sandwich today that chicken sandwich is family. Thank you so much for joining us here on the show, Restaurant Brands International. Yeah. I was just going to say make sure you try the black and chicken sandwich, which is coming out on National TV and on the 7th of November. Awesome sandwich, really cool experience. It's a flavor of New Orleans all around the country. All right, so I was putting in his notes. So we're going to have to do it. We're going to do it.

4727," From here on we go on another pan. Get me the other pan. here at the song you know what time it is. Welcome back everyone. Time for the time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this on the day, Maryott is joining its rival Hyatt and raising its annual profit forecast thanks to higher pricing and a strong rebound in leisure and business travel despite recession risks pulling on consumer spending. It is remarkable how much we've seen the travel demand cited even outside of travel industry earnings reports. We were talking about Papa Johns earlier in today's show and them citing the return, the strong return of travel and how that impacted their business. And here we're also hearing from Maryott and Hyatt, similarly the same in that return of not just the leisure traveler but some corporate travel trickling back into. Yeah, I think we this holiday season is going to be expensive to travel. We've heard now from the airlines as you know we've now heard it from the hotels prices are going up and they were already hard to begin with. One of the reasons that Maryott might be down today, one analyst at Bernstein flagging that the pipeline under construction is falling and falling again. So maybe that's part of the reason that the stock is down a little bit that there is some concern about the recovery of that going into next year of the net unit growth. All right, Wayfair reported Q3 results. It's been slightly on revenue but missed on earnings. So it's a dip in its active customer base and orders per customer. It's now looking for break even EBITDA in 2023. But we're seeing the shares up 9% nonetheless here. Pretty good market response here for Wayfair and Etsy. I think it was a market was expecting worse things from both companies and didn't get it. And I think also we're seeing this theme emerge that when companies are talking about cost cutting, when they're talking about a focus on profitability that the market likes that. Even if the top line numbers or even if last quarter's numbers are looking pretty lousy. I mean when you got a revenue drop of 9% and the stock is up 9%. I don't know. Yeah, an international was dismal. It was down 24% year over year. Now of course the business would be more challenged internationally within some of the areas that Wayfair does operate. But again, they said that they're continuing the work that they set out and really focusing on some of the controllables within Wayfair around driving cost of interest. The nailing basics and earning customer and supplier loyalty. And finally this morning, a little bit of maybe so we're lining going into Thanksgiving Walmart is promising to sell a basket of Thanksgiving dinner ingredients at last year's prices. That's a move to attract customers by easing the sting of soaring US inflation. That lower pricing will extend through December 26. It's going to apply to traditional holiday fair like whole turkeys ham stuffing mixed cream. So as remember, our brick diploma recently told us what it was at a 15% increase. I believe overall in the Thanksgiving basket. So this is good news for people shopping Walmart. Is it good news for Walmart margins? Well, I already decided I'm getting one of those black and chicken sandwich from Burger King for my Thanksgiving. I'm ready to go. I'm actually buying ten of them and free some. That will be our friends giving here on the set. We'll just do the chicken sandwich reviews perhaps. Let's do it. I might be around for Walmart here. You're not going to come to Burger King. I know you're not. I was thinking about you. I wasn't going to buy you. I'm bringing the Popeyes chicken sandwich. Family.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,18,2022-11-03 14:58:23

I'm bringing the Popeye's chicken sandwich. Family and Thanksgiving sauce, I'm sorry. It's okay. Sorry. We can do a separate friend's giving. We can do a separate friend's giving. What a downer. Oh, you just basically called me a loser on life, and you say, it's great, thank you. How a great rest of the day. You'll be with your family too, stop lying. Come on, come on, all right, we gotta leave it there. Sorry. I keep up with you. It's gonna continue our cover with welcome concerning your report with King Thanksgiving. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Too late. Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. in the east. 8 a.m. here in the west. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. The ultimate level of interest rate will be higher than previously expected. Those comments from FedShare Jerome Powell sending stocks falling, the S&P 500 extending its declines following the worst, bed day declines since January of last year. One of those stocks, haliton, shares their plummeting after reporting another dismo quarter. We're gonna break down the numbers for use straight ahead. And we'll speak to the CEO of Lumenar Technologies. We're gonna ask him about his Q3 results and what he's hearing from car makers. First though, we are doing a market check. As we said, we saw the big U-turn really in the session yesterday and we are seeing the declines continue. With the Dow down 84 points, the S&P 500 down 15 and the NASDAC down 52 in terms of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,19,2022-11-03 15:03:20
4729," you turn really in the session yesterday and we are seeing the declines continue with the Dow down 84 points the S&P 500 down 15 and the Nasdaq down 52 in terms of sectors we are seeing energy kind of the outlier here along with industrials and materials. And of course we are watching yields very closely given the back of that Fed decision that came down yesterday. 10 year yield there. Take a look at that at 415. Let's bring in Jared Blickery for a deeper dive on the market today Jared. How are things looking? Things are looking a little odd I'm not going to say dismal but a little bit red on the US frontier. You can see the Nasdaq leading the way down down about half a percent so not a disaster here. But let me take you inside some of the moves that we've seen in the currency markets now. First I want to start with the British pound because we had a bank of England decision overnight where they raised interest rates there on the short end of the spectrum by 75 basis points. Sound familiar? That's what the Fed did yesterday, but what's different is that the bank of England signalling that they're pretty much done and that markets had anticipated them continuing to raise rates. However, that was a mistake on part of market participants. And so their currency is actually losing value with respect to the US dollar is down 1.5 percent. Might be a little bit hard to see this chart here. This is a three month chart of the British pound versus US dollar. And we can draw this trend line here is broken down so it is racing back down towards parody with the US dollar. Now this is a little bit of breathing room perhaps to the UK people. However, you got to imagine that inflation going to rear its ugly head once again there in a worse situation by the US with recession. They're considered pretty much imminent if they're not in it already want to show you the 10 year Tino yield now at Keiko you just mentioned that it's up to 4.14 percent the five year even higher 4.36 percent and then on the very short end of the spectrum the 13 week T bill yield a bit less than those two so we have the yield curve expanding on the very short end. Now what I want to show you is also the US dollars is going to be inverse to what we're looking at in the pound so it is stronger by 1 percent and by the way these are 20 plus your highs so the US dollar has been giving stocks and other risk markets quite a bit of trouble lately and that is a case today as well. You can see tech communication services really taking on the chin here down about 1.3 percent energy in the green today but look at over the last two days we can see the mega half sectors these three down here down 3.4 almost 5 percent and that's really reflected in the Nasdaq 100 this is again over two days apple down 6.5 percent Amazon a little bit less meta down 5 percent so is alphabet just show you what's happening today a little bit better picture but looking at some losses here guys so we'll have to see what comes of this into the close. Okay still early on in the session here thanks so much for that Jared. Let's take a deeper dive here now on the Fed after the decision to raise rates again by another 75 basis points Fed share power warning levels of U.S. interest rates will go higher than previously projected take a listen. At some point as I've said in the last two press conferences it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal. There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates even so we still have some ways to go and incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected. With more on the road ahead for the Fed look at the Yahoo finances Jennifer Schomburger and Jen we saw the reaction of the markets yesterday but certainly the Fed sure making pretty clear that they are the data is just not where they want it to be. Good morning Kiko that's right Fed share pal setting the table to begin the next day. The Fed is slowing down the pace of rate hikes but says the question of when to moderate the size of rate increases isn't as important as ultimately how high the central bank will ultimately raise the Fed funds rate to team inflation. Pell says interest rates will now rise higher than forecast until the Fed gets to a level that's quote sufficiently restrictive. All this means the interest rate projections for ending rate hikes and forecast back in September are now too low. So the question is how much higher do they go from here? Well Roberto Parley who was a long",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,20,2022-11-03 15:06:59
4730," 0.6% forecast back in September are now too low. So the question is, how much higher do they go from here? Well, Roberto Parley, who was a long time fed watcher over at Piper Sandler, says he thinks the peak rate could rise to 4.8% at minimum. Though he says the fed can't continue hiking at 75 basis points every meeting, which is why they're looking to slow down. If they did, they would reach 10.6% by the end of next year. Now, the market is pricing in a peak fed funds rate of 5.15% in June of next year. That's about 20 basis points higher than before the fed meeting. Will Stith, a bond portfolio manager over at Wilmington Trust, says he thinks the terminal rate might not also be higher, but also stay higher for longer than what the market is expecting, given that the fed hasn't seen progress on inflation like they would. Like, now, Paul says he doesn't think the central bank has overtitened, but perhaps the risk of continuing to raise rates aggressively risks cratering the economy, which is why the fed is looking to slow the pace of rate hikes so the economy can better digest those. Indeed, Alice, over at Bank of America, say that policy lags complicate the ability of the fed to judge their prior actions on the economy, and that now that they're moving into more restrictive territory, the risk-reward trade-off favors smaller rate hikes going forward. I keep going. Okay, certainly a lot to look ahead to. Thanks so much for that, Jen. Well, let's keep the conversation going on the fed and what this means for investors. We've got Priya Mestra, TD Securities Managing Director and Global Head of Rate Strategy. It's interesting here, Priya, when you look at the market reaction to yesterday, it felt like there was a bit of a resetting of expectations after there was so much hope on a potential had fed pivot or a pause. Now that we heard from Jay Powell, where do you put the terminal rate and what does it all end? Sure, thanks for having me. So it was a nuanced message that the fed was trying to convey yesterday. Slow pace, but potentially higher end point. And the focus remains squally on inflation and how quickly does it decline? You know, does it decline? How sticky is it on the way down? And so we actually devised up our terminal rate focus. We were in the 5% camp before yesterday. Now we're thinking 5 and a half by May of next year. And then the fed keeps it there because inflation is extremely broad-based. It has been sticky on the upside. We think it's going to take a while for it to come back down. And we're taking the fed at their word. They're committed to getting inflation down. And so we think they're going to struggle to ease or even stop hiking until their clear signs that inflation has downshifted. And so we think they're going to continue to raise rates. I do think that the risk of recession has become even greater. Because there are lags that the fed cannot see that data right now. The impact of policy tightening. They're going to continue to tighten. And I think as the economy starts to slow down, their task becomes a lot harder because if inflation is high, even if the unemployment rate is rising, I think we can't get a preemptive fed that can start to ease. So it makes the risk of a downturn by in the second half of next year. Very high. We're actually looking for a recession in the second half of next year. And then the fed starts the easing process really in 2024. So it's going to be a tough couple of years as the two conflicts of the fed. I think the two goals of the fed are in conflict. When you say the risk of a recession is higher, I mean, how much more significant? If you're already looking at a recession in the second half of the year, how does that differ from where you were going into the meeting yesterday? Sure. So I think we were anywhere nervous about a recession because it's not just the fed funds rate. You look at the tightening and financial conditions. Or you look at the tenure. Most of us borrow at the five to 10 year part of the curve. And those rates have risen significantly. And it's been a real rate driven increase. So we were anyway concerned that things are slowing. I think which app out, I think reinforcing the inflation commitment, not giving any room to letting lags play out or being willing to tolerate a slightly high inflation for a longer period of time. I think these were all things that the market that's been waiting for a pivot was hoping for. And that's why we saw that big reaction to the statement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,21,2022-11-03 15:11:21
4731," likely high inflation for a longer period of time. I think these were all things that the market that's been waiting for a pivot was hoping for. And that's why we saw that big reaction on the statement because it looked like the Fed was at least nodding to lags. But then it turns out, no, there might be nodding to the lags too for the pace of hikes, but not for the endpoint. And that makes the chance that the Fed takes rates higher. That's why we revised our terminal rate, you know, five and a half QT is also continuing so that can keep pressure on that belly of the curve or the tenure. And that makes the chance of hard landing higher. And I would say the market is under the impression it's a short, shallow recession. Well, if you don't get any monetary help and I don't think we're going to get any fiscal easing, you know, this idea of a short, shallow recession, I am pushing back against that. I think it couldn't need not be a weight-type recession, but a recession that can last for a while because you just don't get that policy support that I think we've been used to the market. The market's been used to getting some help. And I think that help is going to be much harder in a high inflation environment. Yes. So the warning certainly elevated for investors who are out there. Priya, you know, you pointed to the fact that there's always a lag factor with Fed policy. And we certainly heard from the Fed, Terry, yesterday acknowledging that we're now into what four-stray jumbo size hike. I mean, to what extent have we already seen that take hold? And how much of a lag factor are you looking at? Sure. So I think there's a shorter lag between Fed policy and financial conditions. I think transparency, the fact that dot plot, the communication from the Fed makes the, I think, market price in Fed policy in a better way. Of course, Fed policy itself has been extremely hard to call. I mean, they've changed their dot plot significantly every dot plot this year. But I think the financial conditions are pricing it in somewhat appropriately. I think what is unknown is how quickly does inflation come down. And if it is sticky, I do think there's going to be more financial conditions tightening, because that means that the Fed is going to keep going potentially even higher than our forecast of five and a half on the terminal rate. But then there's the big question on when does the economy respond to it? And we've had this big white savings buffer that the consumer has had. That is buffer is dwindling. That that buffer is dwindling. So over the course of next year, we think more in the second third quarter that the consumer starts to pull back. And that's what we will start to result in a recession. The labor market will start to pull down. So, you know, I think the lags might be, there's a lot of talk that the lags might be shorter. I think for financial markets, I get that. But I think for the economy, the lags actually might be longer because the consumer has a savings buffer. So the labor market's going to look tight until that savings buffer is gone and service demand starts to slow down. And we think that's a second quarter third quarter time frame next year. So, which is why the Fed has free rate to keep raising rates really into the face of a recession. So either way you look at it, all signs pointing to more pain ahead. Priya, it's good to get your insights today. Priya, Mr. Rattini, Securities Managing Director and Global Head of Rate Strategy. What is time now for our trending ticker? And today we're taking a look at shares of Roku, hitting a 52 week low today, down about 8 percent despite beating estimate than its latest quarter. The streaming firm warning it expects the macro environment, the pressure consumer discretionary spends further and a great advertising budget. The company expects these conditions to be temporary, although it says it's difficult to predict when they will stabilize or rebound. Roku's now forecasting fourth quarter total net revenue of roughly $800 million and lower year on year player and platform, revenue certainly a deep decline in Roku shares today. Well, coming up, it is another rough day in what has been a brutal year for Palatine investors. After the company issued disappointing guidance, we're going to take a closer look at the numbers on the other side of the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,22,2022-11-03 15:15:41
4732," $12.10 shares of peloton coming off of the lows of the session, but still down more than 3% after the company issued weak guidance for the holiday quarter. Even though the company CEO says quote, the ship is burning. Joining me now to break down the results. We've got city senior analyst and managing director Ron Josie and Ron. Okay, so we can focus on the negative. We know this has been a turnaround story for some time, but I want to flip the question and start with what I think could be a positive. You say this is, you know, sort of the turnaround story is starting to take hold. And we did hear from CEO Barry McCarthy today thing that we're done now in terms of flashing headcount. I mean, what it's, what's the silver lining out of this report if there is any. Yeah, no, OK, go. It's a good question. I mean, because we can talk about the negatives for a while here and there's some things that we definitely need to be aware of, but the bottom line is churn improved in the quarter. We have newer distribution models with third parties like Amazon and Dix on top of Amazon's top of pelton's first party that that should help drive continued growth. You have a cost base that is significantly reduced. I think employees are down over 50% really since February. So really what you have here is a streamlined business that has a tremendously engaged member base where turn is coming more in line with historicals after the pricing increase. And you have visibility, at least we think there's visibility in the greater overall or positive free cash flow towards the end of this fiscal year. So in the back half of this year. So the silver lining here is look, turn around hard. We know that churn is improving that suggests engagement remains strong. And frankly, these newer things that the business has been doing in terms of third party partnerships, their rental program with fast things along those lines that they should improve overall results over the next couple quarters going forward. And when you were on that call today after the earnings results, specifically asking about free cash flow guidance and what made the leadership team feel confident about beating the one year timeline. I mean, how confident are you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,23,2022-11-03 15:20:17
4733, results specifically asking about free cash flow guidance and what made the leadership team feel confident about beating the one-year timeline? I mean how confident are you in their strategy? You know did you feel like you got to satisfy your answer? Yeah no I think it's a really good question I think the answer is yes right I think when you think about the changes that have happened in this business and really just the last six to nine months between the multiple rifts between basically out going from insourcing or being a verticalized strategy from creating your own bikes or manufacturing your own bikes or delivering them yourself to outsourcing all of that this business has gone through a tremendous amount of change and so as we take a step back and we think about where we are today the cost base is much lower so in other words the variable cost structure is certainly better. The member base seems to be stabilized which is strong and that gets to engagement at the end of our day. The day our core thesis here is that engagement drives everything in this business and our view here is that those members that are on the bike stay on the bike for a while here and it's something that we haven't really seen in other type of consumer subscription models so that's positive and then you add to that you know we're going into the holidays with newer distribution partners and so all this combined should help drive better free cash for the other years we just talked about but does it give us more confidence I think the interest yes now to be clear there's changes in this business right so the fast business or the rental bike business it will change the the structure of when peloton generates the revenue their distribution partners third part of distribution partners with amazon and dix will have a lower overall selling price because it's more of a wholesale partnership for the most part that'll impact revenues but I think the profitability should start showing up here over the next couple quarters and naturally the key thing of proving out the viability in the business here so the top line seems to be stable at least in subscribers that's a good that's good and overall cost are are pretty much taken out so we're we're leaner more streamlined organization that should drive a greater overall profitability and sustainability in the business finally really quickly I mean this doesn't change the fact that this is a stock that has seen a steep fall this year we're now looking at eight dollars and forty seven cents a share if the turnaround strategies working and you feel like things are taking hold is this kind of where fair value should be so I mean it's a good question we well our price target you know publishes is certainly higher when if you would strip out everything and just look at the subscriber base and where churn where it is the 1.2 percent x some one time things like you know that there's a lot of value in that subscriber base and as a result we think there's a lot of value in this business and and we think shares are not reflecting that because the turnaround take time especially one of this magnitude especially one that you know went through the pandemic with massive demand being pulled forward and now we're when a completely different environment and macros coming up here as we just heard your prior guest talk about in terms of concern so you know from from a fair value perspective we think there's room to go on shares that said we understand it's a turnaround strategy there's a lot of moving pieces here we want to see that free cash flow better our models suggest we could get there or we can get there and that's really what's going to drive shares here the next call it 12 months or so and that that's our vision or longer term focus on the name.

Also beating estimates for the quarter, but signaling a less optimistic view of what's ahead for the company. The sports brand said sales for the 2023 fiscal year are set to rise in the low single digits that's down from the 5 to 7 percent it projected earlier. The company attributed lower expectations to quote a more challenging retail environment and additional negative impacts from changes in foreign currency BMO analyst Simeone Seagull who is a friend of the show telling us this morning that he believes shares are still priced too low.

Thanks so much for that. Alexander Simeonoba. Well, coming up on the other side, Elon Musk. We're reportedly planning a length off half of Twitter staff. We're going to have the details and Netflix rolling out that much anticipated ad supported tear today. Certainly stay tuned to find out what you can expect to see from the new service. We'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,25,2022-11-03 15:28:53
4735," Well, Twitter is expected to shed a whopping 50 percent of its workforce as early as this Friday, this according to Bloomberg and CNBC reports. Twitter's new owner, Elon Musk, remains under pressure to justify his new purchase price, even his industry add dollars. And the overall tech sector revolves on the back of a more cost-conscious consumer. That's bringing Yahoo Finance is Dan Halley who's on top of this story. And Dan, by the way, I was sort of looking at the calendar thinking it hasn't even been a week since this deal was closed, but certainly Elon Musk moving very quickly here, these job cuts, something that was anticipated for some time. Yeah, it'll be a week tomorrow, or maybe tonight, depending on which timeline you're going by. You know, the 50 percent number is interesting because it's actually less than was feared if that is the actual number that Elon Musk ends up going with. Originally, the thought was that he was going to let go of 75 percent of Twitter's workforce, which could have been devastating for the company. 50 percent, obviously still a massive number of employees that would be let go. And then you have to take into account how much it will cost Twitter to actually remove those employees or lay them off. So there's that cost associated with it as well, but over the long term, it would save the company money. And this is something that Elon Musk is really trying to do is just find any way to pull money out of Twitter after you said this really expensive $44 billion acquisition that he himself has admitted to overpaying for. So this is just one of the ways that he's looking at. And Dan, when you think about the business structure of Twitter, it is still primarily driven by ad dollars. Since Elon Musk took over last Friday, we have seen a number of companies come out and say, we just don't feel comfortable staying with the platform because we don't know which direction is going. Yeah, there's been a few agencies and big companies. I believe GM was one of them that put their advertising on hold indefinitely at Twitter. Just to give you a few numbers from Twitter's last, and I guess final earnings report as a public company, they saw a revenue decline, 1% year over year to 1.18 billion. They lost $270 million representing a net margin of negative 23% and costs and expenses ballooned 31% year over year. That's just in one quarter. So obviously, it's not a well monetized company. It's been the complaint that's always gone around Twitter. And then we have Musk now trying to figure out how he's going to make money off of this. One of the ideas obviously was the $20 fee that you would pay to get a verification blue check mark. Then after a back and forth with astonishingly Stephen King of all people, Elon said that he needed to make money and that they would lower it to $8 a month. And that might go into effect on Monday according to reports. So he says the reason for that is to get rid of trolls and bots. I don't know how that's really going to do it. We've seen schemes like this before. We're executives who talked about having customers pay to get rid of bots and spam things along those lines. Famously, Microsoft's Bill Gates when it came to emails. So that didn't work. So I don't know if it's going to work on Twitter either. Would you pay $1 to keep the verification? Good. This is actually good question. Feels like a Twitter poll. That's crazy. Look, I pay Twitter by providing my information. And that's basically what the deal is. It's kind of the fousy impact that we make with all of these social media companies where yeah, we'll provide you with our information and then we'll use your service for free for free in quotes, right? Because you are giving them your information. So if I'm still providing Twitter with my data, you should figure out a way to make that work. And I understand the ad market obviously not where these companies want it to be. YouTube ads missing by $400 million on expectations. And then we have obviously Meta Facebook. They're kind of really treading water there when it comes to the ad market. Snap doing equally is bad. So it makes sense that Twitter would be struggling at least in this environment, but they've always done that. And finding a way to monetize it in a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,26,2022-11-03 15:32:51
4736," Snap doing equally is put bad so you know it makes sense that Twitter be struggling at least in this environment But they've always done that no you know finding a way to monetize it in a better way Make sense, but God I will never pay eight dollars a month for a ridiculous check I think I might be on the same page is you I mean I'm curious that you know you know You know must think essentially we have to pay the bills somehow But it's gonna be interesting to see how many people actually do pay up and worth or think it's worth at eight dollars To keep the check mark, but we shall see we'll continue to follow it. Thanks so much for that Dan Well saying with advertising despite overall gloom as companies pull back on their ad budgets Netflix is charging ahead the streaming service rolling out its ad supported tier in the US with experts and analysts Shrugging off those concerns even as competition grows within ad backed Streaming that's bringing Yahoo finances Ali Canal Who's been looking into this and Ali? I guess you know the question is What's the bar here for Netflix at a time when ads have been slowing down across the board? Well, I think for a company like Netflix the bar has already been set high, right? The platform confirmed that it's sold out of nearly all of its ad inventory globally for the launch and that Optimism has been echoed from both analysts and ad experts alike I spoke to Kevin Kram. He's the CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO and he described this as a quote pivotal moment for the media industry He also cited Amazon's Thursday night football as another watershed moment when we had streaming Subscription and ad supported go to the masses and now with Netflix rolling out ads Disney right behind them This is the new future for consumers in the new future for tech companies for Netflix It's reached peak penetration in the North American markets and this is a way for them to really capture more subscribers There have been some concerns that consumers will trade down but analysts have said that it's actually a spin-up Opportunity a chance for Netflix to secure more revenue Increased profits. That's in the name of the game on Wall Street right now and Netflix needs to capitalize on that in order to remain at the top of the Streaming wars and advertisers seem on war with that as well Yeah, Ali when you look across the streaming Landscape, you know those like who have been early on with with the ad supported tier Netflix entering into new territory with Disney plus right behind it. What's the big risk for Netflix? It's a hundred percent a super big risk if we think about the programming on Netflix It's a lot of mass content right? It's global a lot of it is considered Quote-unquote niche and that's where we could see some potential tension advertisers They like to play it safe They won't content that captures large audiences and that might challenge Netflix's current content strategy another Potential risk could be when it comes to acquiring new licensing agreements to run ads Netflix warned that about five to ten percent of Content will not be available on the ad tier due to those ongoing conversations with studios like Disney and NBC Universal we had a new Wall Street Journal out report earlier this week that noted that shows that are really popular in Netflix like Gray's Anatomy the crown you they could potentially be impacted by this So that's something that they'll have to figure out and then finally another issue is just add integration right how will this interrupt the Binge model that mean Netflix so successful in the first place and how can the company really tackle those Measurement tactics to lower advertisers amid all of this competition So these will just be some of the growing pains but Netflix signal that it's ready for the ride They're ready to innovate and that potential is what's driving up the stock price higher up more than about 35% over the past six months So analysts ready for it investors ready for it. We'll see if consumers are ready for it too Yeah, the counter argument being that this actually might not be a bad time when consumers are trying to pull back on spending So we'll see where those numbers come in Ali. Thanks so much for that Well coming up Qualcomm shares falling sharply week smartphone demand causing the company to issue poor guidance We're gonna break down the numbers for you on the others",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,27,2022-11-03 15:37:12
4737," This closing update may be headed to notice showing someäft remark all major migrants No contact, no questions. Find more stories from the viewer and leave them in the comments box. Qualcomm shares sliding this morning after the chipmaker posted fourth quarter earnings and issued disappointing outlook as weak smartphone demand hit its chip business. Joining us now for more on Qualcomm is keeping capital market equity research analyst, John. John, you know, when you think about where the concerns are, obviously a weak outlook, draw down inventories or concerns about where that demand is going, weighing on the stock today, but you know, you still have a price target that is well above where it's trading. How much of the declines we're seeing you think is justified given the numbers? You know, I think some of the declines are certainly justified, right? You know, their guidance was much worse than expected. I think it was pretty clear and obvious that, you know, self-reduce smartphones, particularly in Android, in China regions and Europe has been particularly weak, but their guidance actually came in, you know, a lot worse than people have expected at this point. And what does that tell you about where things are headed? I mean, we've heard these warnings from so many of these chipmakers. How much of what we heard yesterday is Qualcomm specific? How much of this is about a broader drawdown that we're seeing that's likely to last? I think this is part of a broader drawdown that we're seeing within kind of consumer applications, anything that touches the consumers, PCs, smartphones, consumer electronics has been extremely weak. You know, Qualcomm was issues were compounded by the fact that not only sell through an end to man was weak, but they were also being impacted by kind of a broader inventory correction. What happened during the pandemic over the last couple of years in response to the chip shortages is that customers don't buffer inventory that basically guarantee supply. But now that end demand is starting to soften and supply is starting to normalize, you're seeing a lot of these customers destart.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,28,2022-11-03 15:42:05
4738," supply is starting to normalize. You're seeing a lot of these customers destack to get back to kind of pre-candemic normalize inventory levels and that's really compounding kind of the near-churn issues with the call counter. In addition to sort of the market demand which obviously you know sort of has a significant impact on the business you've also got chip makers overall being caught right in the middle geopolitics you know that the export control that the Biden administration has implemented so that there's essentially a line that's cut off between the US and China at least in advance ships. Where do you think Qualcomm is positions and all of that and how much way do you put on that in terms of the headwinds the company is likely to fake? I think the impact by these latest BIS export restrictions really don't have a big impact on Qualcomm. The latest restrictions are really targeting kind of advanced computing targeting kind of data center workloads around machine learning and AI. Qualcomm plays more that consumer space right there obviously have an emerging business within automotive they do have an IoT space but there are the latest around restrictions really don't have a material impact on Qualcomm in our view. And finally you still have an overweight rating on the stock although you did cut your price target from 170 to 150 dollars a share. Looking at where the stock is today that's still more upside what do you think is going to be the catalyst that gets you there? I see a couple things right so I think in this sort of environment the investor appetite is there's an appetite for stocks that have kind of reset and de-risk kind of forward expectation. There's a handful of companies and companies that still have not seen kind of weakness yet estimates are still at historical highs but here you've had come two significant cuts to forward expectations so we think the estimates for going forward are largely de-risk. The second thing is a company has a clear line is sight to when inventories likely are going to bottom they quantify the inventory correction at roughly two billion dollars a quarter for the next two quarters but it looks like we're going to bottom in the March quarter and at which point you get back to kind of normalize run rates. And then the last thing I point out is much of the weakness that they're seeing right now are being caused by the lockdowns in China. You know at some point these rolling lockdowns have to have to cease and we think that's going to happen at some point in the first half of 2023 and we expect there to be significant pin-up demand by the the average consumer in China coming out of that. Yeah certainly a lot of companies hoping for a shift in policy especially in China and COVID. John Vin Keebank, Capital Markets, Equity Research Analyst appreciate your time today. What is time now for our chart of the day taking a look a longer look I should say and to shares of meta as a stock drop 25% last week. Now if you were one of the lucky ones who purchase shares of the tech giant five years ago it is now down around 50% over the last half decade erasing its gains from the pandemic. This comes in the same period in which the S&P 500 is up more than 40% despite the downswing for major tech companies and as investors are embracing the idea that a slowdown could go on for years we can most certainly be seeing this trend of the S&P 500 outperforming those big names like Apple and that could continue a lot of paying for those holding on to those meta shares. Coming up the CEO of Luminar Technologies tells us how he plans to be the law of the last one that comes to self-driving technology. We'll certainly want to see it for that. We'll be right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,29,2022-11-03 15:46:02
4739," MUSIC and Right? Look away хотите stock up nearly 5%. The global automotive technology company reporting revenue of nearly 30% higher from the previous quarter and up 60% year on year. Luminar Maitreya gets full your guidance as it remains on practical chief key 2022 milestones. For more on all this, we have Luminar CEO Austin Russell joining us today. Austin, it's good to talk to you. I'm going to get through the numbers in a bit, but I want to point to an announcement that someone argue kind of overshadowed the strong core that you had. Luminar's lighter equipment and software now shipping on cars made for China's largest car maker, SAIC. This certainly points to positive movements at a time where there's concerns about where self-driving is going. Talk to me about how that's progressing and what that tells you about the timeline for wider adoption. Yeah, no, I think the whole point of what we've done is that really after 10 years of innovating, coin-roads-hyping, developing, industrializing, I think we're finally making this journey into series production. This is really the first time in this industry when you see this level of technology actually make its way out of that whole moonshot R&D phase into production vehicles. It's something that we couldn't be more excited about. But yeah, it's happening. It's coming together. Of course, SAIC is the largest Chinese automaker with their day of a new fully electric brand, Kedical Rising Auto with the R7 that we're launching on, but that's just the start. Just around the corner, you have Volvo with their EX90 that they're going to be launching on actually just one week from today or sort of the one to that on November 9th. Then we also just had pole star. They just introduced the pole star three a couple of weeks ago, also featuring Luminar. All this is converging and this is just the start. Then we're safe to use a Nissan and other partners that we have. Fantastic. Let's talk about the numbers in the quarter, especially with the cash on hand. You ended the quarter with more than $550 million in cash. When you look at this spending, $150 to $200 million a year, it certainly looks like you are on track to reach profitability. Talk to me about the timeline you're looking at.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,30,2022-11-03 15:51:06
4740," spending $150 to $200 million a year. It certainly looks like you are on track to reach profitability. Talk to me about the timeline you're looking at right now for the company. Yep, so we're going to be hosting actually a Lumenard day. You know, come the first quarter of next year, we're going to outline all the details with the guards to our timeline and plans associated with becoming cash flow positive. But I think the key thing is is that we have more than enough capital at the table to be able to get that cash flow positivity with a strong buffer as well for everything that we want to do for our business and beyond. So that's that's really good. But and unfortunately in a very privileged position when it comes to capital needs and there's huge upfront capital requirements as well that's needed to make this happen in addition to of course the technology, the people, the resources, the partnerships, you know, the manufacturing, all that has to come together. But yeah, that's the we're in a great place there. Then when it comes to, you know, generating real business and revenue, this is the first time that this kind of tech is making its way into a series production for these kinds of, you know, next generation safety and autonomous capabilities and having that revenue ultimately is able to be very helpful towards building a viable business. Whereas, you know, the vast majority of autonomous vehicles really in companies are either a pre-revenue or little to no revenue for the foreseeable future. So that's a fundamental different cheaters well in terms of what we're actually able to make happen and the growth curve with the automakers. And finally, Austin, you pointed to some of the positive steps you're taking in the partnership that you have with car makers. But, you know, we've have had some setback in the autonomous driving push. We had Ford and Volkswagen most recently, you know, pulling the plug essentially on their self-driving ambitions. And I wonder where you think things are headed. I mean, was this kind of shakedown inevitable given the technology that needed to get to full autonomous driving? It's sort of the grand vision that was set out years ago in terms of where this is headed. I mean, is that still intact? Well, one, the grand vision that I think many gave in the industry is absolutely not intact. But the key distinction here is that that's a completely different world than the kind of stuff that we're doing here at Luminor. The main issue with what we've seen from a broader autonomous vehicle standpoint is that the vast majority of companies have really been focused around eliminating the driver with all-out robot taxis in urban environments. So the big bet that we made was actually not that at all. It was actually for consumer production vehicles in trucks as well. As an opportunity to be able to improve the safety of the vehicle, enhance the driver, not replace the driver altogether. And that's a key distinction here of how this is happening. And the rest of it is actually, I mean, for what it's worth, it's not any different than what I was saying a handful of years ago. I think people may just listen more now. But the reality is that that's a 10-year journey. That's a long time frame here, too. What we're doing is already starting to make its way into production cars today. It takes years worth of work and advance and a lead-up of what we've had to do to make it happen. But because of the fact that we're focused on safety, we're focused on much more constrained problems here. Getting rid of that, you know, $100,000 roof rack full of sensors and a super computer in the trunk. And now having something that can go on to production vehicles as a cleanly integrated system, that's what we think is incredibly powerful. And that's why we're seeing all this adoption by all these major automakers. And I think as the industry evolves, we're only going to see more and more people pivot towards that strategy, which ultimately ends up, you know, just as with that Argo case, ends up being more synergistic with the stuff that we're doing. Yeah, it's certainly been great to track all the progress with Luminar. Austin Russell, Luminar CEO, appreciate your time today. Thanks so much for joining us. We want to get to some breaking news here with lift. The company now announcing it plans to cut 13% of its work staff resulting in a loss of hundreds of jobs. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. It is the second round of layoffs at the company in recent months as the ride chair let go of 2% of its employees during the summer. Now, the company has more than 4,000 employees, not including its drivers. And we're going to bring you more developments on this story as they come in. We are seeing that stock down nearly 2% right now. Well, coming up,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,31,2022-11-03 15:54:38
4741," Not including its drivers, and we're going to bring you more developments on this story as they come in. And we are seeing that stock down nearly 2 percent right now. Well, coming up, more drama surrounding the Washington commanders. We're going to tell you what we are learning now about the future of that franchise. Let's move back to the break. The U.S. Attorney's Office has opened a criminal investigation into the Washington commanders for according to a report by ESPN that came at just hours after owner Dan Schneider said he will explore potential transactions involving the team. And as you said, the commanders and Dan Schneider are facing a federal investigation for financial and properties. This is kind of the latest step that Dan Schneider has had to go through in his quest to kind of keep the team. And I think as we saw yesterday with the initial report by Forbes, a conjunction with this federal investigation into the financial and properties, Dan Schneider's term as the commander's owner is definitely coming to an end. Other owners have quietly been kind of pushing for this. Even Colts, owner Jim Urce, came out and spoke out against Dan Schneider at the owners meeting a couple of weeks ago. So it was probably time for this to happen. Beyond this, there's been a litany of other scandals that the commanders have suffered through under Dan Schneider's leadership. Now it's going to be time for someone else to try to get a crack at it. And one of these, I guess it's kind of funny because Dan Schneider's punishment for going through these things, going to be getting a nice check for a solid football team, but it's about over for him. Yeah, I was going to say a lot of people lining up to see if they can make their bid for that as well. Keeping you busy, Charles McDonald, thanks so much for joining us today. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and Yahoo Finance live.

4742," Hi! The Vago are going on quite the trip today up 16% after seeing revenue in the third quarter rise 33% year over year, but warned that high interest rates and inflation will continue to impact consumer spending Travago CEO Axel he for joins us now. Axel always a pleasure to speak with you on the back of earnings here. Look let's dive into some of the results here and some of the trends that you're seeing if there's one catalyst that really sticks out to you from the quarter. What would you pinpoint? I mean the quarter shot very strong demand as we expected. We want to travel and it's a basic need from our perspective and also what we see in the pandemic and you've seen that the demand was very strong prices were strong and that is obviously a good combination for us as we compare prices. And bring it down for us a little bit Axel where you are seeing demand both geographically and in what kind of travel. Yes so the Western markets were strongest in Asia. It's obviously very very different market by market, but generally speaking the recovery has is not been as strong as in in Europe and in America's. Kind of travel. So over the place so our top destination worldwide is London so the big metropolitan attractive cities but then you've also seen in the US a lot of demand for for Orlando for an hour and so for the for the Disneyland trips family trips. So really I would say very very broad demand and all the trips that you you couldn't do during the pandemic people people wanted to do now. Axel Brian Chesky over Airbnb talks a lot about on his earnings call as night a little bit of a slow down in the holiday quarter you seem it. No I mean the the the third quarter was very strong for us. I mean what we are seeing right now that there are first signs of a change in consumer behavior which which is exactly what you would expect. I mean the inflation is hitting consumers pretty much everywhere in the Western world and what we expect for next year and we see early signs of that are basically three things. I didn't just say I wanted that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,33,2022-11-03 16:04:14
4743," Exactly what you would expect. I mean, the inflation is hitting consumers pretty much everywhere in the Western world. And what we expect for next year and we see early signs of that are basically three things. One is that people are reducing their their length of stay. So trying to save some money by by staying for one day less. And there we see some early signs in Europe in particular. You do expect people to actually go to different destinations where either transportation is cheaper or the destination overall is cheaper. And again, we start to see that in particular in Europe, or for example, Morocco is becoming more popular, which is a very attractive destination, but usually not on top of everybody's list. And then the last thing is that that you expect people obviously to compare prices more if things are getting more expensive and that's exactly what we do and we also see they are an increase in activity. What are the types of stays that you're seeing people lean into, especially as they are comparing prices. And where potentially are they beginning to push back on some of those prices. The types of trips, the top destinations are actually still very similar as I said, I mean, London worldwide in the US, New York is actually on top of the list. But we do see that people start to move away from the top and most expensive destinations to more secondary destinations to still have a good break and then to take some time off without sacrificing on the experience, but saving some money. So we're trying to just tie a lot of pieces or pieces of economic puzzle together. So we had SD Lauder hour earnings this morning noting a slowdown in travel retail and specifically called out Asia. What are you seeing in your business in terms of international travels to the US and then also in Asia specifically? It's very difficult to comment on because the situation in Asia is very different market by market. I mean, generally speaking, we see some recovery, but very different Japan, for example, we've seen a strong and strong increase in Q3, but it's difficult to comment in general. Overall, the US is obviously in a specific situation given the strength of the dollars. So traveling from the US to Europe in particular got a lot cheaper. So we see a lot more demand from US travelers for the top and most attractive European cities like London, Paris, Rome, etc. The other way around obviously got a lot more expensive and you can also see that. So I'm going to go. I mean, it's difficult to say to be honest, I think my view is somewhere in the middle. It's, I do think that that people will continue to travel and I do think that the spending for traveling next year will be up from this year. On the other hand, I also do expect travelers to cut back on the nights that they stay in hotels to save some money and to compensate for the inflation that you have on travel costs. So you're not a bad market. I mean, the market will be up next year, but not a golden market either. So moving the stock price here today in reaction to earnings here, we've seen them moving higher and holding on to some sharp games as the rest of the market is waiting for the Fed. So I'm going to go and see if you're appreciative of the time as always, Chicago CEO, Axel Hefer. Axel, thanks so much. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,34,2022-11-03 16:07:40
4744," you you you XBO now an independent company after spinning off off, it's Truckload Brokage Business RX-0. And also, we've got a new CEO for XPO. That's Mario Harrick, and he is joining us now, Mario. Full disclosure, you and I chatted a little bit last night at a reception at the NYSC following the formal spinoff here. And we, of course, have talked to Brad Jacobs, who is now stepping down as the CEO of the company, about the rationale behind what's going on. But just to take a step back, we have talked so much about the broader economic landscape. We've talked a lot about the buildup that we've seen in inventories and a lot of industries. What are you guys seeing across the country in terms of the flows of goods? Julie, it was great seeing you and thanks. Thanks for having me on. So we are seeing a softer macro this year than what we saw last year. And we're hearing mixed feedback from our customers. Today, our less than Truckload Business is two-third industrial companies. And we're seeing some of these companies having more product flow through their supply chain so they're ending up shipping more product while other are seeing softer than N. And on the retail side, it's similar feedback. Now, the said you wouldn't see it in our numbers. We delivered a great third quarter, but we delivered record EBTAA. We grew our LTL business. We delivered record revenue and record EBTAA. And we're seeing an acceleration of tonnage where we flipped, which is a measure of volume, where we flipped to positive on a year-on-year basis in September. And we expect to be positive on volume in the fourth quarter as well. Just given this backdrop, Mario, how are you investing in the business? Have you pulled back at all? We are planning for our less than Truckload Business. We are continuing to plan to invest more into the business. Over the last year, we pivoted to the next phase of our LTL business. We call it LTL 2.0, which is based on capitalizing on the high return on invested capital into our less than Truckload Business. So we're opening up more terminals. We're adding more trailers to our fleets. We're adding more trucks. And we're seeing the success of doing so. Again, we accelerated our tonnage trends at where we buck typical seasonality. And we are also bucking industry trends in terms of gaining market share as well. In those tonnage trends, is there anything that says to you that there is a spending pullback among some of the most notable consumers that you're carrying for? So today, our business is two-third industrial companies. And we call it 20%, 25% are e-commerce and retail type companies. We are seeing some customers slowing down where the consumer, for example, is buying less. But we are also seeing some retail companies having to turn through inventory to have the right type of product in their supply chain. And in that case, they are shipping more product. For the industrial companies, again, a lot of these companies through COVID had pent up demand, where now they are being able to get the product they need to fulfill open purchase orders and that's leading to more demand, while others are seeing softer demand. So currently, it's a very mixed...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,35,2022-11-03 16:12:06
4745," and that's leading to more demand, while others are seeing softer demand. So, quality is a very mixed environment, and generally the macro is softer than where it was a year ago or where it was earlier in the year, but using our own company specific initiatives who are being able to go out and gain market share by focusing on delivering great service for the customer and having capacity in our network to gain that business. Mario, what's happening on the tracker front these days? We heard a lot about the tracker shortage that even before the pandemic, right, this was something that was pretty acute in the industry. What's the status and in the industry more broadly and then for XBO specifically? The driver shortage obviously is not new to our industry and it's something that did accelerate through the pandemic. Now things are getting easier where we are now than where we were earlier in the year, just to give you an example in the third quarter, we saw an increase in applications for post-the-drag go up by 58% on a year-on-year basis. But there as well, we have a company specific initiative that I'm very proud of that helps us counter the driver shortage. We operate our own driver schools out of 130 locations. And this year we are on track to graduate more than 1700 drivers to join our rank. And it's a great career opportunity for people who join our company as dog workers and they can actually become a driver where they can make more wages and have a great career with us over the years to come. Marrow, you're following big footsteps and a big personality and Brad Jacobs. I'm convinced he's off camera there, but maybe he's not. How do you, what should investors know about you? Tell us a little bit about your story. You got it. So my background is in technology. I initially, this is where my education was, went to MIT for my engineering degrees. And since then, I used to be in the tech sector for a while, but been with XBO for the last 11 years. I was Brad's third hire on the team back in 2011. And we've been part of every decision we've made. And I've learned a ton of from Brad over those 11 years. And I look forward now to this next chapter of being CEO and look forward to the next chapter of our company that we're very excited about moving forward. You know, in that extensive kind of work history, where do you think about some of the parallels that we've seen in previous economic downturns and how you intend to lead XBO through what is the impending or anticipated next downturn? Well, we are modeling for different scenarios for next year, depending on if the macro further softens from here or if things do get better as well. Now, in our LTL business, it's, again, it's a business that has a high mode associated with it. Where you haven't had the big competitors go into less than truck load in 30 to 40 years. And that leads to strong pricing dynamics, where obviously price is a stays positive in our industry. Even in the soft market, we anticipate still having pricing power to our customers. The second area is managing variable cost. Is that if the macro thus soften, today 75% of our costs are variable based on the volume that we are moving through our network. So we would anticipate to work both efficiency angle and using leveraging our technology as well to make sure that we are managing that variable cost to the volume we're seeing in the environment. But again, I would intend to also gain market share and we're bucking typical trends and we're bucking industry trends in terms of being able to gain more market share from our customers. Well, go look at this holiday season. Go look on your CEO, Journey Looking Forward to staying in touch. XPO, CEO, Mario Harret. We'll talk to you soon.

Streams what are the expectations of the economy and now supporting that view or not. Yeah I do think that investors need to be a little more careful in the municipal bond space than they had been in the past look the reality is is that for a long time people looked at munis as the sleep easy at night asset class that there was no risk because frankly interest rates always went down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,37,2022-11-03 16:20:37
4747," is that for a long time, people looked at munis as the sleep easy at night asset class, that there was no risk because, frankly, interest rates always went down and credits never defaulted. And credits aren't going to default at any meaningful rate, but we are facing kind of unprecedented times. We are facing municipalities with unfunded pension liabilities that are enormous. We are facing wage pressure. And so again, I'm by no means merit if Whitney, but I do think that credit risk is real. And so investors in this space need to be comfortable that their investment managers are tearing apart these issuers from the bottom up. All right. And along those lines, I'll just give you the floor here. We've got a quick time for one more. What do you want to talk about in terms of investments here if you had 60 seconds? What do you do? I buy bunies. Look, I am bullish on municipal bonds. And here I'm bullish on an absolute basis because yields are so much higher. Look, I can go out into the world today and buy bonds inside of 10 years that yield in excess of 4%. You do the tax equivalent yield on a 4%. And that gets you above six and a half close to seven. Most investors I know would happily clip 7% today, tomorrow, and frankly every day until the end of time. And if you pair that with the fact that it gets a lot pretty difficult to expect 7% equity returns over the next three, six months, given the realities we're facing, I'm talking about a low volatility asset class. I'm talking about limited duration with almost zero default rates. Munis look like a pretty sexy place to be. I, well, you might, they might be giving Ryan, Ryan Reynolds something for his money. Oh my God, I totally messed it up. But I really appreciate you stopping by here, Nick. You made municipal bonds interesting for me and our audience here. Something that doesn't always happen. We're going to have to leave it right there. Let's bring in Dennis Lockhart. He's a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of that land and getting his take on the 75 basis point height that we just got from the Fed and Dennis. I want to start here because the Fed is laying out this possible rationale for a slowdown in the pace of rate. I'm saying that in determining the pace of future increases in the target range of committee is going to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lives with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. I know you were specifically watching the language here, the change that we could potentially hear from the Fed. What's your takeaway on that statement? Well, I'm not surprised at today's rate move. I think that was everybody expected that. I am a little surprised at the inclusion in the statement of language that gives some hint of what the path of policy might be. That's a little bit unusual. I think it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,38,2022-11-03 16:25:14
4748," in the statement of language that gives some hint of what the path of policy might be. That's a little bit unusual. I think it's welcome because they're acknowledging that they're getting close to a restrictive point. And at some stage, we'll be looking a lot more tactically at whether to add further rate rises or to pause. They're signaling that they're getting into that zone. And I think that's a good thing. And of course, they want to keep their options open as much as possible. So Dennis, based on that, another evidence you're taking to account, you expect 50 next month, and then a pause in 23 or keep hiking. Depends on the data, of course. And we can't forget that. They're always going to be looking at the data and looking for some signs of progress against the inflation problem. I think it's quite plausible that they step down to 50 next month. I would even say that's likely. Then they have a meeting January 31st and February 1st and another meeting in March. I think it's a little early to project those rate hikes if they actually occur because it's going to depend on all the inflation reports and analysis they do between now and then. And Dennis, they did say they would take into account cumulative tightening as well as some of the lags that people were concerned about in the real economy showing up. The third says that they're keeping that in mind. And this was a unanimous decision. Are you surprised? Because we were hearing a little bit of dissent as to how far and how far the Fed should be going right now. Well, let's remember that the list of voters is a subset of the total committee. And so a unanimous decision on the 75 basis point increase doesn't necessarily reflect that there isn't a fairly robust debate during the meeting among those who think we should slow down and those who think they should keep at it. Perhaps raise 75 next meeting or even thereafter. So you just don't know what the discussion is. The minutes that come out in three weeks will give us a much better sense of that. But I'm not surprised that it was unanimous. I don't think anyone had a basis on which to dissent at this meeting. Dennis, two questions, Jerry. Even in this room before, I know we've asked you this in the past. But at this point, in the economic cycle, when there's so much uncertainty, when we do have five inflation prints between now and the next Fed decision, what kind of conversations do you think are going on inside the Fed? And when you take a look at inflation right now, science, that it could potentially be cooling. How confident are you that we will see significant cooling here in the coming months? Well, I tell you, I have been surprised at how persistent the inflation picture has been so far. I think it's very hard to conclude that inflation in any way is really broken to the downside, broken out to the downside. It is still a very troublesome picture when you take all of the different components into effect or into consideration. Your earlier speaker correctly said autos seemed to be softening. Perhaps shelter and housing is softening, but it's still a little bit early to draw that conclusion. I think they will be talking among themselves about messaging, and that is if they decide to step down, how do they frame that decision exactly? And it's a little bit of a tricky communication problem, I think, for Jay Powell and for his colleagues. Earlier this week, sir, BlackRock is out with the notes saying we think the Fed will only stop when the severe damage from rate hikes is clear. Do you fear severe damage? And if so, where would we see it? I've been saying now for many weeks that the more persistent inflation is, the greater the chances or probability of a recession. Simply because they have one crude tool that they're using.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,39,2022-11-03 16:29:24
4749," Inflation is the greater the chances or probability of a recession. Simply because they have one crude tool that they're using. It doesn't address every root cause of inflation. And if inflation continues, they're going to be highly tempted to continue to use that tool. So the risk of overshooting or oversteering is very definitely there. And I just think that you have to consider the possibility of a recession of some severity. I'm not sure what severity in 2023. And we know that Chair Powell had talked about pain for the US consumer, for the everyday American with this. For people who are wondering what this means for their credit card bills, how should they be bracing themselves for this period? I spoke yesterday to someone from the retail industry who gave me a sense that the consumer is already adjusting to some extent. And that most of the spending in this particular chain of stores is on essentials, not on discretionary items. And I think that's probably what's happening. The overall consumer numbers are holding up. The constitution of consumption is shifting to essentials. And I think you're going to see particularly those at the lower end of the income spectrum doing that more and more. And with more and more difficulty, frankly, if essentials continue to rise in price. And does your work like, this is your reaction to the market's reaction to this. And I know you're more of an economy guy, not so much an equity person. But when you take a look at the euphoria that we continue to see in the markets, when the Fed is still saying that they're going to raise rates. And just might not be as aggressive. Do you think a move like this is justified? Now, we'll see if it holds for the next couple of market sessions. But I think what you're seeing right now, and then the Dow's up with 202 points, is sort of a sigh of relief, many rally after a lot of suspense building up. They're not so much suspense, but let's say just building up to the decision and the announcement by the Fed. And I think what the Fed has done today, as well as has said, sort of confirms the expectations that we're already priced into the market. And the market is responding positively to having their expectations affirmed. The markets are walking through a desert surgeon for any hope that there might be water on the horizon, aren't they? Dennis Lockhart, great to have you here, sir. Appreciate that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,40,2022-11-03 16:33:59
4750," For more on the Fed's decision, let's now bring in Joanne Fini, advises Capital Management partner and portfolio manager also joining Sarah House, Wells Fargo Senior, economists, and as we're already seeing the doubt up about 340 points just on that announcement, even though we knew obviously that this was expected. So Joanne, what's your initial reaction to this? This was widely baked in at this point. Yeah, no surprise here and very little changing in the statement that we've seen so far. Clearly the big news will come with the press conference. I think there was some concession to and recognition of that growth is moderating, and I think that might suggest to the market that the end might be in sight for rate increases. We do expect another rate increase in December, potentially also in March. The Fed does have a really big challenge here trying to get this inflation under control when there are so many factors that have contributed to it from rising wages in the tight labor market. We saw some new data on that yesterday and also from continuing shortages in various parts of the economy. So the Fed has a hard problem. The market is finally recognizing that it's going to take some time to solve, but they now may be thinking, okay, next year may not be as bad as it could have been with rate increases, at least pedering out. Sarah, what do you expect to hear from Jerome Powell? So I expect that we'll still hear that he is utterly determined to bring down inflation, but I think we'll also hear a little bit of a tone that we've seen in the statement here, and that we're getting to a point where we're at more of a crossroads when it comes to policy. So the committee, of course, has already done tremendous tightening to date, so we're raising the Fed fund rate by 375 basis points in just eight months, but we need to take into account how much tightening has been done. So there's a little bit more new on some thinking in the outlook, but I think it's important to remember that even as the Fed is signaling that it might be ready or might be in a place where it can begin to slow the pace of rate. I expect that the committee is far from done for policy tightening. So when you take a look at the Dow's reaction right now, we're up just around 267 points. We were up over 300 points just a minute ago. S&P in the green Nasdaq now back in positive territory up just around four tens of a percent. The excitement that we're seeing from Wall Street is that a bit overdone at this point just given the uncertainty out there and the fact that the Fed is going to keep raising rates, it sounds like. You know, I think the Fed said something that really should have been obvious to everybody that that sort of understands how they work is they made an explicit statement that they're going to take into account the cumulative tightening that has already taken place is when they gauge how much more tightening needs to happen. Now, and of course that there will be lags and they would take those lags into account before deciding whether to tighten any further. So I mean, that should have been obvious to people, but I think that came as perhaps some reassurance to the market. And remember where we are. I mean, the market, the S&P 500, the Dow, the Nasdaq, certainly has already traded off significantly when you think about the rate increases that were signaled starting about a year ago. And I think investors, particularly long-term investors, are looking forward and they're saying, hey, stocks have become pretty inexpensive here. At some point, these rate increases are going to cease. And in fact, we have more rate increases behind us than we have in front of us so that rate increase headwind, particularly to growth stocks, is now going to be tapering off at potentially reversing as we get into the second half next year. So it's a good time potentially to buy some stocks if you're a long-term investor. And so we did see some of the balance sheet tightening stock to slow in June. How much of an indicator though is that of how far away we might be from the Fed perhaps plateauing or at least pivoting at some point? So I think we're still some ways in terms of reaching that that turmoil rate. So right now, our expectations is that we'll continue to see the Fed hiking through probably the March meeting. But I think we have to also acknowledge that inflation is quite stubborn right now. And so we're still expecting for PC inflation to be running a little bit under 4% annualized through the first half that through the first half of the year. And so I think that's going to keep the Fed on guard when it",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,41,2022-11-03 16:38:10
4751," little bit under 4% amulet through the first half of the year. And so I think that's going to keep the fed on guard when it comes to its policy stance. So still looking at a pretty tight stance of policy. And it's also not just about how far the fed ultimately takes the fed funds rate, but I think we also have to bear in mind how long the fed will keep that policy rate at such an elevated height. And Joe, as important as this day is, it's hard not to look ahead to Thursday with the CPI number. That's next Thursday. If you're Jerome Powell, what can you point to if you want to say, all right, we see inflation beginning to come down. Where? Well, you know, use car prices for one is one area. And they can go through that whole list and point to different areas where prices have come down. That's the one that consumers are probably find most understandable. And they're seeing it happen if they're in the market for cars. But there are a lot of elements in the pricing figures that are starting to come down. But the fed is also going to be aware that house prices, which are risen so much only slowly, make their way into the CPI inflation figures. And that is still a positive contributor. But if you look out six months or a year, we'll be able to anticipate that those also will start to recede. And that's, I think, why you see inflation expectations longer term still anchored around 2.5%. I'm talking longer term. And in the medium term, probably going back towards 4% next year. So, you know, there's clearly signs that the fed can point to that inflation is starting to moderate. Sarah, what do you mean just in the odds of a recession? Obviously, that is a huge concern still with Wall Street. Some of those projections have been pushed out into later next year. Where do you stand on that? Yeah, so we're expecting the US economy will enter into a recession around the middle of next year. So right now we've seen the economy stay out of it essentially because consumers are drawing down savings to continue to fund spending. We've already seen some sectors like housing effectively already in the recession, given how much we've seen new construction and sales decline. But I think as we get further out into next year and consumers increasingly running on fumes in order to spend that we think it's going to be harder to maintain the growth and environment that we've had. So we're already seeing labor demand begin to edge down. So we're expecting hiring to slow. And that's further going to weigh on real disposable income among households at the time when inflation while moderating still remains very high and is keeping real income from actually growing. And Joanne, you've called this a market of contrast. In terms of what investors should own, is they're trying to make sense of some of the stickier parts of inflation versus some of the parts that are going down. How do you approach this if you're an investor? Yeah, this is a really unusual setup if we do end up in recession, which isn't looking increasingly likely. It doesn't look uniform at all. We still have some parts of the economy that are expanding. Car production, for example, still facing shortages from the chip side. Services still trying to find enough labor to operate. And so when you look as an investor, you have to be able to distinguish which parts of the economy are going to be hit the most by inflation. And that primarily is where inflation bites the most, which is really the mid to lower end consumer, which is really going to feel that pinch. So it's going to be challenging potentially for sort of mid-range retail and mid-range restaurants to keep drawing in those customers. But the bargain opportunities, where am I going to shop the save money at TJ Maxx or a target? You know, after they've now cleared out their inventories and stocked the right stuff, they could be real opportunities. And we like those two stocks particularly. And then you have to look at the luxury brands. Some of them continuing to do well. You have to watch the inventory situation. But the high end consumer really isn't going to feel the pinch so much from this inflation. Gas, food, the small proportion of their budget expenditures. So they're not going to be hurt that much. So really is a time to pick and choose where to go. Favorite the luxury consumer retail markets and really stay away from the mid-range where folks or companies are likely to see a fall off in their foot traffic as folks go bargain shopping at a place like TJ Maxx.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,42,2022-11-03 16:42:32
4752," you you you prem ще language surprise you in particular the mention of the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. Well, I thank you and all the prior guests who just spoke before me are focusing on the right things. That the addition of that language elevated the importance of the idea that when you get closer and closer to a destination, you slow down just like when you're driving a car. And that's what they're telling us. The the the the knowledge of the lags, the cumulative tightening that's in the pipeline. The signal is clear they're getting closer to their pause. It'll probably be early to mid 2023 call it 475 or 5. And then they have to stop and wait to see the cumulative impact of the tightening. The fact that the bond market is reacting with the steepening where two and five or yields or double digits richer makes some sense. This new language I think for closes at least for now the concern that they're going to keep going 75. And I think it affirms expectations that were built off of recent FOMC members speeches and appearances that this day was coming. This idea of slowing the pace and getting closer to the pause. But RJ when we're getting closer to a destination, I'm looking down to my GPS and I'm seeing the time go down 10 minutes or so. We're not seeing that in inflation. We're still at a 40 year high. What evidence in there is there that we are closer to the destination, which is 2%. I'm going to stay with the car analogy. If you are going to drive your car by looking solely in your rearview mirror, you will hit a wall or another car. That's what the Fed would be doing if they looked solely at CPI and PCE realized past inflation while driving the car of monetary policy is the economy moves forward. They need to look forward and anticipate it's undeniably clear that monetary policy is not instantaneous mortgage rates have surged. But other interest rates sensitive sectors are only now starting to feel the pain, the cumulative impact of a sharp and aggressive tightening that is already underway. They need to look through the windshield as to where the car is going. Lags take time to overcome. We cannot set policy solely on realized past inflation. The Fed is heartened by the way by the fact that inflation expectations are all pretty much south of 3% whether you look at tips or you look at surveys. So they are acting in a manner that keeps those expectations relatively contained and they can't set policy solely on realized inflation. It's like driving a car looking solely in the rearview mirror.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,43,2022-11-03 16:46:47
4753," see solely on realized inflation. It's like driving a car looking solely in the rear view mirror. So, Ajayvan, in terms of what we saw with Q3 real GDP, obviously we know that the Fed is data-dependent, but with so many different indicators pointing in different directions here. What does this mean for not just the likelihood of a recession, but how deep of a recession we might be headed for? Q3 GDP was an upside-by surprise propelled heavily by the surge in exports in the drop in imports. The post-pandemic world has been dominated by heterogeneous re-opening all kinds of distortions to global trade patterns. Who actually thinks exports are going to keep growing in a double-digit rate? Very few people. The economy is slowing in China. The economy is likely going to be in a recession in Europe. Global growth is slowing. Our exports are not going to continue to expand that pace. If you ex-out the impact of trade and government spending from the Q3 GDP release we just had, it was 0.1 percent at an annually, a seasonally adjusted annual rate, 0.1. That wasn't that strong of a GDP print. The underlying internals when you ex-out traded particular as well as government spending are weaker. The midterms are coming up. Government spending is not going to be surprising to the upside when we have divided government with Republicans controlling perhaps the House and the Senate, certainly the House. Are Jay, certainly when you take a look at the market direction, they're not waiting for the press conference just in terms of how they are interpreting this additional sentence that was put into the statement. But when we look ahead to that press conference from Fed Chair Jay Powell, what are you hoping to hear? What will you be listening for over the next 45 minutes or so? The new language that we've all been talking about is going to get questions from the media that's assembled in the room there. They're going to want to drill down for further meaning there. It's a challenge that Chairman Powell faces getting in front of them at any session, but he actually has a unique challenge now. This language, which I think was unanimous across all the voters, suggests that they're opening the door to the pause. It's not right away, but we're getting close to our destination, as I said before. There's going to be a lot of questions about how the market should interpret that new language. Why was it put in there? Clearly the committee on a unanimous basis feels like if it belongs there. Can Chairman Powell still sound hawkish on inflation while acknowledging the need for a pause and not open the door to a huge rally? Former President Law Card mentioned it earlier. It's a tough act. It's not an easy task to communicate such subtleties to the markets, which often trade on soundbites. There's the risk that he gets up there and tries to talk back or walk back the language in the statement. That seems like a low risk. I think he may elaborate on it in a way that will get further bullish response from potentially equities and from the intermediate part of the Treasury curve, for example. So then, RJ, on behalf of investors, if you were in that room with Jay Powell, what would you want to ask him? Interestingly enough, I think that the bigger questions come down to quantitative tightening, the Fed's plans with respect to the balance sheet. They've made their pace of balance sheet reduction abundantly clear. But there's plenty of talk, including talk at the Treasury Department, of the need to sort of bolster liquidity. Bond volatility both implied and realized volatility has been extraordinarily high this year and liquidity conditions have likely something to do with that. I'd be interested to see what Fed staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York working with the Treasury. What they're thinking about, what measures could be taken to allow the balance sheet to shrink, to be consistent with the overall monetary tightening. But to do so in a way that might be less disruptive to the functioning of the marketplace. RJ Gallow, always great to have you. Federated her knees. A senior portfolio manager. Thanks so much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,44,2022-11-03 16:51:19
4754," you youclass want to bring in the great hill of Capitol chairman. We have Thomas Hayes joining the show here to help us break down what we just heard from a Fed chair Jay Palantum and you take a look at those headlines trying to walk that very fine line not trying to sound too hawkish also didn't want to sound too dovish. Do you do a good job? A fair job. I think to Dave's point it's you know equity bulls looking for a drink in the desert. He didn't give us much water that's for sure but he did leave on the table the possibility of a downshift in December from 75 to 50 or the next meeting. So so the point is that the pace will be slowing at some point even if the terminal rate is going to be higher so we came into this meeting thinking the terminal rate might be about 4.6 to 5. Coming out of this I do think that the downshift will be a positive thing I think the markets will take 24 hours to digest this and then we'll start to look company by company but if you look at the seasonality that we're going into right now we do have the election coming up and that's coming up very very shortly. The average return for the S&P in the 12 months following a midterm election is 18.6%. So he's trying to throw cold water on it. He has left the downshift you know he came out to the cumulative tightening he's going to take that into account he's going to take into account the lag and then he completely through cold water on it with the it's premature to pause. So it's kind of double talk here I think on balance we've got two more CPI prints before the December meeting we have the jobs report unfortunately the Joltz report was a little hot yesterday so we're not expecting miracles from the jobs report on Friday 200,000 non-farm payrolls if it comes in hotter than that markets going to price in 75 in December pretty quickly if it comes in light then maybe that that downshift still is on the table. And there's no real indication that that CPI number on Thursday is going to be any better we haven't seen I mean yes use cars we can see he reiterated the labor market is a big problem what else did we learn today that we didn't know an hour ago yeah the labor market is definitely running hot I mean we were just talking about restaurants in Connecticut you can't get a you know reservation at a good restaurant in Connecticut so so the economy continues to run hot labor markets hot inflation's hot I know that there have been major speakers come out say owners equivalent rent is miscalculated it's going to take nine months to show up in the inflation numbers we agree with that the question is is the Fed willing to wait and look through the wind shield versus the rearview mirror and right now they're looking a lot through the rearview mirror and not maybe enough through the windshield I think a good model to look at where we are right now is in 1948 post-World War 2 when we borrowed a lot of money for the war to fight a visible enemy debt to GDP got to 120 percent they ran inflation above trend for about three to five years three to five percent and that ratio dropped from 120 down to 63 in just five years",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,45,2022-11-03 16:55:28
4755," percent. They ran inflation above trend for about three to five years, three to five percent, and that ratio dropped from 120 down to 63 in just five years. So we might have to run inflation above trend. He did acknowledge long-term inflation expectations remain anchored. If you look at five-year inflation break-even, they're at 265. So they're getting close to the target. And Chair Powell has reiterated he's very concerned about expectations more than actual inflation. So so long as that long-term expectation stays anchored, we could start to see the down shifts that that we've been looking for. If not in December, certainly in the following meeting. And as some investors are looking through the tea leaves here, we know that Jay Powell has asked about the three-month yields, talking about the inversion getting close, not there yet, though. He did say that although it's his preferred measure, they are going to monitor it, but he did seem quite tight-lipped on that. What are your expectations about what the yield market is telling us? Well, you know, you initially saw bonds get bid on the news that they were going to actually pay attention to lagged effect of monetary policy. And by the time he finished the press conference we're basically unchanged, the dollar sold off huge. Initially when we saw we're going to take into effect the cumulative tightening and we're going to take into effect the lags. Now the dollar is just off a little bit. So basically we're unchanged here. He came out way more hawkish in the press conference than in the original statement. So the market didn't love that, but like all of these Fed meetings what we usually find is the first move is often the wrong move. So give it a day to digest. I think it's people say, you know, it's very rare where we come to the table and we say the economy's strong. This is really bad news. What are we going to do about it? So I think it's a mix here. You know, if you look at earnings for this this quarter, you know, they're up 2.1%. They were expected to be up 2.8%. You back out energy. They were actually negative 0.6%. So he is destroying demand. If you look at the GDP for Q3, you know, plus 2.7. If you back out the exports, which was a lot of energy and petroleum products, you actually had negative GDP. So their policy they have to start to acknowledge that it is working on a lag basis. We started in March. You know, negative GDP that in actuality that would be the third negative GDP quarter. If you backed out exports with earnings coming in slightly lower than expected. So these things are working on a lag basis and the fact that he kept that downshift on the table, I think is that drink of water in the desert Dave. So what if we don't see that downshift though because there's already been criticism out there that the Fed has been way too hawkish up until this point. This was the fourth 75 basis point hike in a row. How did say he doesn't have a sense that the Fed has overtightened or that they have moved too fast. Are you at all concerned that they have been too aggressive up until this point? I do think when all of a sudden done they'll find that they've been too aggressive and they'll have to pivot and actually start to cut sometime in 2023. If we've seen throughout history, it's always the case that they overtighten. The question is how much they're going to look through the rearview mirror and how much they're going to look through the windshield. And right now they're solely looking through the rearview mirror. And the reason the market initially rallied was that they said, okay, we will take into effect the lag basis but then they discounted it completely. So I think when you look at the seasonality of the market, look, if the data comes in strong, it means the economy is strong. The market here at a multiple of 16.3 versus the 18.5 for the last 10 years, a lot of this bad news is priced in. You know, the NASDAQ down 30%, S&P still down 18%. We have priced in a decent-sized recession at this point, but stock selection and sector selection is going to be critical. You can't just say wholesale all-in, risk on. You really have to look case by case moving forward. Okay, RJ Gallimay, the same reference. Look through the windshield and not the rearview mirror. Fine, you look through the windshield and tell me how they can even begin to consider pausing. Yeah, well, based on what data? Well, I think first and foremost, you look at commodities. They completely rolled over since June. So that's going to be felt in the economy. You do see the GDP numbers. Basically, if you net out exports, you're looking at three consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. That's material. You look at earnings coming in lower than expected. You back out energy, you got negative earnings growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,46,2022-11-03 16:59:55
4756," Out exports, you're looking at three consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. That's material. You look at earnings coming in lower than expected. You back out energy. You got negative earnings growth year on year. This is only going to accelerate. What would be nice is to see some back off in the CPI numbers, some of the inflation prints between now and December to give them cover. They really need cover. They can't say we're going to predict that the CPI numbers are going to come down in six months. Therefore, we're going to pause. Give them something to hang their hat on, whether it doesn't appear that it's going to be the jobs report on Friday after the jolt. But we've got four major prints between now and December. Maybe they don't downshift in December. Maybe it is the meeting afterwards. But he did effectively toggle and say, if not December, then the meeting thereafter, in which case people can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And the terminal rate, maybe it's not 4.6, maybe it's five. But so long as inflation expectations, the five-year break even stay anchored at 2.6, I think they'll be able to downshift sooner than everyone thinks, and certainly in the first quarter of next year. Nazou, and talking about the losses accelerating down now off 351 points Nasdaq off a nearly 3 percent. Right, Tom Hayes? Thanks so much for joining us in the studio. In this episode of influencers, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Capitalism at its core, what we're talking about when we talk about that, is the absolute pursuit of profit at all human environmental and social costs. A lot of these price increases are potentially due to just straight price gouging by cooperation. We are talking about a catastrophic development for millions. Hello everyone and welcome to influencers, I'm Andy Sirwer. And welcome to our guest, Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Representative, nice to see you. Thank you, thank you so much. I know you want to talk about student debt and some other issues as well, but before we get to that, I want to ask you about inflation and interest rates and Fed share Powell, who recently said that the strong labor market made it appropriate for him to soon raise interest rates. I wonder what your take on that is. Well, I think particularly when we have this conversation in the context of inflation as well, it's really not just labor, it's not just rising wages, but there's a lot of different dynamics that I think are contributing to the increase in prices, whether it's supply chain complications. Yes, labor issues, but sometimes lack of labor, a lack of the ability to be able to work consistently in their jobs, which is also tied to pandemic controls. And also there's a real distinction to be made between inflation and price gouging. And there's a lot of evidence that particularly industries with high concentrations, corporate concentrations, whether it's almost oligopoly level industries, a lot of these price increases are potentially due to just straight price gouging by corporations. Are you concerned about inflation and higher interest rates and the impact on working people? I mean, wherever prices are increasing and it's making it difficult for someone to be able to feed their family, that is always going to be a major point of concern, a primary point of concern. But the real key is making sure that we're diagnosing the causes correctly because the danger here is that if we say we're helping working people too much and say that the cause of this is, oh, it's because we provided too much assistance during the American Rescue Plan stimulus checks were too generous. That is why we are dealing with the problems that we're dealing with now. What that's going to result in is a pullback in the assistance that some families need the most right now. And when we already talk about the cessation of the child tax credit, we're dealing with",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,47,2022-11-03 17:04:11
4757," Resultant is a pullback in the assistance that some families need the most right now. And when we already talk about the cessation of the child tax credit with the failure to pass the Billback Better Act before the end of last year, we really need to be very careful about diagnosing these issues correctly. Because on the flip side of that coin, if we say there are real antitrust issues here, there's a lot of corporate abuse of power leading to price gouging, then that allows us to pursue lanes such as antitrust and also pursue labor protections, COVID protections that can help people get back into the workplace and stay safe in the workplace. Right, so you are seeing those who are suggesting that it's because of the assistance that people had during COVID that that's inflationary and therefore we need to swing the pendulum back. Yeah, and I couldn't disagree more. Right. I couldn't disagree more with that assessment. Student loan debt. And I know you've called repeatedly for the President Biden to forgive student loan debt. Why hasn't that happened? And what do you think will happen if the pause that exists presently is allowed to lapse? Well, I cannot understate the danger and the risk economically, politically and just where we are right now is a country of allowing the moratorium on student loan payments to lapse in May. If we just allow a full just continuation of student loan payments, we are talking about a catastrophic development for millions, the over almost 50 million student loan borrowers in this country. There were millions of student loan borrowers that were already defaulting going into the pandemic. But more than that, we are at such a delicate point in the financial and just general economic recovery post-COVID that to then restart payments that are essentially the size of a mortgage payment, sometimes even larger on a generation that was already so devastated, not just by this, but the recession, et cetera. I believe it could throw out of balance already what is a very fragile recovery. And not only that, but this forgiveness is on, I mean forgiveness is the just thing to do. It's the right thing to do. Why the President hasn't done it yet? I'm not sure, but I do think that this is an issue of increasing urgency. He has already indicated an openness to it and he has actually already used his authority to forgive student loan debt in certain small, very narrow cases. Because there are people who suggest he doesn't have the authority, is that a legitimate argument or just maybe a smoke screen? I don't think it's a legitimate argument. We've seen, in fact, we've seen him use the same legal authority that the President has used to suspend student loan payments is the same authority that he would use to cancel them. And not only that, but he has used that authority. He has indicated a willingness to use the authority. And I think that it would be extraordinarily important, an urgent for him to do so. And what about the argument that it's a moral hazard? In other words, you're letting people off the hook by forgiving the debt? Well, what I think is the true moral hazard here is the surging costs of education in the United States. What is actually created the moral hazard is this guarantee of saying we will issue minors, hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt at almost any level with almost no limit. And we will allow colleges and universities to dramatically increase the cost of their tuition with the guarantee of that loan value on 17-year-olds. So what is the actual true moral hazard here in the situation? Is the controls on the cost of educational United States? And one very important control in this to that note is tuition-free public colleges and universities. Because then what that does is that it introduces competition into the market to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,48,2022-11-03 17:08:28
4758," To that note is tuition-free public colleges and universities. Because then what that does is that it introduces competition into the market, to which private universities have to actually meet a lower baseline. But, you know, people act as though it's just fancy public schools that are extremely expensive now. But public college tuition has also increased dramatically and far beyond the pace of inflation. You you you you you You have a huge social media following obviously in a big platform have you been either surprised by how much or how little influence that affords you in Congress in other words how does that translate representative? You know that's an interesting question I think it's the way that I've thought about it I go first going into office and then continuing is that there are a lot of in Washington a lot of different sources of power there are some members who have extraordinary connections to different powers players different power centers that are very well connected and networked there are other individuals who are very frankly financially connected industry lobbyists corporations throw their weight and donate and give their influence their lobbyists et cetera throw an enormous amount of their support behind other members of Congress so every single member kind of has their assets that they lean on and for me I decided early on because I don't accept money from corporations",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,49,2022-11-03 17:12:51
4759," kind of has their assets that they lean on. And for me, I decided early on because I don't accept money from corporations. I do not take meetings with lobbyists. I am not well connected. I don't come from a well connected family or community or anything like that. That my ability to navigate and advocate is going to have to be squarely rooted in relying on everyday people and their support and my ability to communicate with them what is going on in Washington. It's an interesting perspective. You self-identify as a democratic socialist and have called capitalism irredeemable, I believe. But what does that really mean? And does that mean capitalism should be eliminated and are your views compatible with capitalism? Well, I believe that in a broad sense because when we toss out these big words, capitalism, socialism, they get sensationalized and people translate them into meaning things that perhaps they don't mean. So to me, capitalism at its core, what we're talking about when we talk about that, is the absolute pursuit of profit at all human, environmental, and social cost. That is what we're really discussing. And what we're also discussing is the ability for a very small group of actual capitalists and that is people who have so much money that their money makes money and they don't have to work. And they can control industry. They can control our energy sources. They can control our labor. They can control massive markets that they dictate and can capture governments and they can essentially have power over the many. And to me, that is not a irredeemable system for us to be able to participate in, for the prosperity and peace, for the vast majority of people. So people talk about stakeholder capitalism, like Larry Fink at BlackRock, where the waiting for different constituents besides shareholders is more equal. Is that something you'd be amenable to? Well, I think at the end of the day, it's who it is about who has control over the very core assets of production in society. If it ultimately comes down to a billionaire or the Koch brothers or the Koch family, having control over the vast majority or large plurality of our oil assets in the United States, if it's a handful of very wealthy families having control over, private families having control over means of production, that is essentially the capitalist system that we live in. It is a small group that is of privatized control over what we eat and how we fuel our society. Now, where we can transition to, and there are certain ideas where we're talking about, for example, Elizabeth Warren has discussed about workers being elected to the boards, governing boards of companies, and also we're here in the Bronx. I represent a community that has the largest concentration of worker cooperatives in one of the largest concentrations in the world. Now, these are alternative ways of doing business. Free markets are not the same thing as capitalism, and you can have markets where businesses and ways of producing, trading, selling goods are really controlled and not just controlled, but given more power to workers, people get a fair shake, union jobs, unionized workplaces. All of these are different steps and levels that we're talking about in a more just economy. Congress people trading stocks. You have come out calling for a ban here, and there seems to be some momentum, but I wonder why this seems to be such a difficult thing to pass, and is Speaker Pelosi a roadblock here? Well, you know, it's not really a mystery to me, why it's difficult to pass. In an enormous amount, I wouldn't be surprised.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,50,2022-11-03 17:17:11
4760," It's not really a mystery to me, why it's difficult to pass. In an enormous amount, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a majority of members of Congress hold and trade individuals stock. I don't know the actual numbers, but it is a very large degree. And you know, the key here is that it's not to say that you can't have a retirement fund or a college savings account. Or a blind trust fund. A blind trust, a mutual fund, an index fund. These are vehicles of investments that are broad. That individual members of Congress don't have direct control over. But even last year, there was at least 75 members of Congress that held individual stock in Johnson & Johnson, Viderna and Pfizer. And we're talking about in the last one to two years. And so that is where we should be drawing the line. I am a member of Congress. Members of Congress have access to very sensitive, security clearances. We have access to very detailed, tailored briefs. Our job is to try to anticipate and legislate for what we see is coming. And we should not have the ability to both have access to that information and be able to hold and trade individual stock. And that's really what this is about. It's about our ability to direct and hold trades in individual stock with access to the sensitive information that the public has given us. Voting rights reform. Is that a dead issue? It's tied to the filibuster, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Sinema, come out against it. What does your take on where that stands? You know, this is, I think, one of the top level questions and issues that we have before us in Congress. I very much believe that we are at the precipice of a return to Jim Crow style laws across the country. We are already seeing these wheels of motion, attempts in Texas and Georgia, across many different states, attempts at voter suppression. And frankly, what Senators Manchin and Sinema fail to recognize and what is disappointing and sad to see is how a historic their stances have been throughout this debate. you you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,51,2022-11-03 17:21:18

4762," on the cases I believe right there in and of itself as to why they should be subject to antitrust activity. I want to ask a couple of personal questions about you. I'm teaching a Columbia this semester and one of my students Penny Ramirez-Bernandez wanted me to ask you, how did being a waitress help you understand the American economy is successes and failures? Well, I mean, I believe that my time as a waitress is the most politically formative experience that I had. It's that along with just growing up in a working class family, experiencing just the ravages of the great recession, almost losing our home, all of that, but particularly the years that I spent working in restaurants. The thing about restaurants is that it is, it really is such a crucible of so many different public policies. I worked alongside undocumented workers. I didn't have health insurance. I tried to buy Obamacare, you know, the ACA Affordable Care Act. I actually used and relied on the policies that were coming out of Washington. And I worked, you know, I was a Senate intern back in college. I got an economics degree. I worked in public policy spaces. I also had worked for nonprofits. There is a ocean of a difference between the white papers and the policy you see on paper and how it's experienced by everyday people. And unless you actually go on to the exchange and try to buy health care for yourself and use that health care and understand how it's serving you and how it's not serving you, it's very difficult to understand why so many people are frustrated by otherwise well-meaning, sometimes democratic policy. As a former dishwasher, I can relate. So I want to ask you maybe a kind of funny question about the moniker AOC. So is that when your friends and family call you or how did that sort of evolve? When did you become AOC? I actually think it's funny enough. AOC really emerged after I won my primary. And I think there were a lot of pundits on television that were kind of like stumbling because my name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It was the news story after I won my primary. It was so sudden. And there were just all these folks on TV that I think were kind of like struggling to say my name that it actually started coming from TV. And so in the past, there were some folks that would sometimes say it jokingly, but it was never a nickname that stuck. But I think it actually kind of came from media pretty overnight. But my friends don't call me that. The folks that I organize with. Do they call you Alexandria? They'll call me Alexandria or they'll call me Alex. My friends will call me Alex. But yeah, it's a, you know, it's shorthand, but I now embrace it, welcome it, except it. And final question, maybe it's too early in your career to ask this, but I'm going to ask anyway, how do you see your legacy going forward? You know, I always feel like I actually think that it is important for young people to ask themselves questions of legacy very early. And I think the reason that that's important is because we shouldn't root our legacy in a position or a job or a role, but we should really root it in a mission of what we want to do qualitatively and how we want to be remembered. And I don't think it's ever too early to consider that because it helps us make decisions, it helps us root us in our values and our morals. And I just hope that for me, you know, what I do and what my community understands and receives and feels from me as their representative is someone that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,53,2022-11-03 17:30:08
4763," You know, what I do and what my community understands and receives and feels from me as their representative is someone that always puts the people of this country first that doesn't allow herself to be dissuaded or distracted by power, influence, etc. and that we are dissuaded and relentless and honest and authentic in our pursuit for a better world. And that, you know, that in that pursuit, we just tell it as it is and try to do everything we can in every moment that we can. And I think that's pretty much it. That's it. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Thank you so much for your time. Of course, thank you so much. You've been watching Influencers. I'm Andy Sirwork. We'll see you next time. Thank you. Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Sousy alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Right now we're seeing all three major indices deeply in the red. But, Julie, let's go over to you. Some breaking news on the economy. Yes, we have the services engaged from the Instoe Supply Management coming in at the slowest pace since May of 2020. 54.4 was the reading 56.7 was what it was in September so it declined there obviously. This is a little better than estimated. 53.3 is what economists was looking for and above 50 does signal expansion. So unlike the S&P global read that we got just a moment ago this is a different slicing and dicing and is one that looks a little bit better. We did see measure of business activity within the index declining to a five month low. The new orders component of this falling to the lowest level since June and the prices paid in in the index part of this is increased and does remain elevated. So still seeing not a terrible picture here but not a fantastic one either that prices paid component to 70.7 from 68.7 so all of this indicates that we still have expansion in the services part of the economy but we're seeing a slowdown in that expansion. And look you saw the market come back just a little bit this a market that may just just wants to reward any data that misses. Maybe. I saw that. I knew you could do that. Oh and we should also mention we just got mortgage rates in the last a few moments as well the new data from Freddie Mac showing that we saw now a redip under 7% it was above 7% last week when we got this 30 year number now it is 6.95% that is the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac. I mean whether it's a little bit above 7 or a little bit below. As the man says it's too damn high as the man says about the rent anyway so watching that as well as a continuing headwind. Indeed and we're taking a look at the major averages to see how they're reacting to the economic data the debt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,54,2022-11-03 17:34:50
4764," and says about the rent anyway. So watching that as well as a continuing headwind. Indeed, and we're taking a look at the major averages to see how they're reacting to the economic data, the Dow Jones industrial average, about 33 minutes into trade is lower. By 324, 327-ish points there, one point to the downside right now, the NASDAQ composite you're seeing that down by about 1.7% on the day, 177 points in negative territory. And the S&P 500, you're also taking a look at some red on the screen there. It's down to the tune of nearly 50 points, 1.3% in the red. Let's take a look at some of the other major moves that we're tracking here on the day. And I wanted to pull up a pharma and the broader healthcare space as well here, and perhaps I'll put this on an equal market rating just so we could actually see some of the names here. Sigma had reported on the day that reported earlier this morning, moving higher on the earnings report by about 1.5%, and of course we've broken down some of the other major earnings reports that have come out today as well to the tune of Moderna. You heard that earlier. And so now let's just take a quick look at where some of the sector activity is continuing to move. And it's actually deeper in the red from when we last checked in on it. Take a look at, and this is over the past two days. So let's just put this on the right scale here. In today, we are seeing technology sector now down 2.4% at this point in time. And so continuing to see that decline or energy, just barely creeping into the green there up by a fraction of a percent, 310th there. Well, the Fed staying the course, and it's aggressive fight against inflation with another rate hike. The move set to further dampen markets and make mortgages and other loans less attractive. For a look at how this is going to affect your personal investments, let's turn to Catherine George, Wellstream Advisors, Senior Advisor. All right, Catherine, take us into your reaction yesterday after the commentary from Fed Chair Jay Powell, the decision from the FOMC and how the markets are digesting this as well. I mean, we've been seeing this for a while, right? They've let us know that this rate height was coming and the market price that an a while ago. You know, maybe there's some short-term noise here, but we were expecting this. Maybe we weren't expecting to hear that in 2023, that could be additional rate rises, which is why the market is probably reacting the way that it is. But, you know, we've been through this economic cycle before. It's not that unexpected and the stock market, the bond market, will all come back. And it's actually a great thing for the bond market, but, you know, happy to go into stocks bonds, whatever you're most curious about. Well, let's talk about the bond market. Let's linger on the bond market, if you will, a little bit. It hasn't been a great time for the bond market thus far this year, right? And you've got both stocks and bonds that have been losing on the year, which is an unusual occurrence. As you said, you know, we've seen this environment before. That particular piece of it is not so common. So how do you navigate through that for your clients? You're right. And, you know, in the bond market, it's a little bit different in the stock market and that the price today doesn't matter all that much as long as you stay invested. You know, the bonds we've bought last year become less valuable, because a new bond will pay you a higher coupon rate. But as long as you hold on to that bond that we've bought last year, you're still going to get the same coupon payment that they promised you, and you're still going to get your principal back in maturity. So, you know, that's the one thing. But once those bonds start to mature, you're actually going to be able to buy much more attractive bonds at higher rates. And it's going to be, you know, much healthier for your overall portfolio, especially for those investors that have a decent portion of bonds. Let's say you're headed for retirement or you're in retirement. You're actually going to start to be able to earn a decent return on that portion of the portfolio, whereas, you know, the past 10 years, we haven't seen that. So, it's actually a good, good future outlook for the bond market. It's just a waiting game. Catherine, as we're seeing today, the market does not like when the Fed comes out here and suggests that rate hikes are going to continue for the foreseeable future. Having said that, is there anywhere, anywhere an investor can hide out in this volatile environment? You know, hiding out is, it's a tricky thing. So, the first thing I'd say is don't overreact, right? Stay invested, keep your stocks and bonds where they are and don't overreact. But I think the biggest thing is the cash, right? We're finally able to earn some return on our cash. If you're uncomfortable with putting any of your extra cash in the market right now,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,55,2022-11-03 17:39:03
4765," The biggest thing is the cash rate, where we're finally able to earn some return on our cash. If you're uncomfortable with putting any of your extra cash in the market right now, then make sure you're getting some sort of a return on that, you know, online bank accounts are offering about 3% right now just to sit in cash. And treasury bills, I mean, you get a six month treasury bill for 4.5% right now. That's a very liquid, you know, market, 4.5% is great. So that's that's one option. But really, if you're feeling like you can take a little bit of risk right now and you have extra cash on top of your emergency reserve, and maybe a little bit extra if you have a job that you're worried about and spending or session. But if you have some extra cash, stocks are on sale. You know, they it's actually a really good time to put some long term money away, as long as you can stomach kind of the the ups and downs of the market. You know, even with today's move lower, we're not sitting at the the lows in terms of this larger kind of downtrend that we've seen for the major averages and the markets more broadly here. Do you believe that a recession has been priced in at least at the bottom end of where we've kind of seen the activity take place over the past few months? Yeah, so I can tell you that I think everyone is expecting a recession and that's like likely priced in. Are we at the bottom? I have no idea. But if we look back to 2008, 2009, you know, behind the time the recession was actually announced, the stock market was already on the way back up. So, you know, recessions are backward looking and as we all know, stock markets are forward looking. So while they're related, you know, if the recession comes out in three months, that doesn't mean our portfolios are going to drop another 20%. You know, everyone is already thinking about this. It's been in the news for the past year. So yeah, I think it's already priced in. I just, you know, we just don't know if it's going to drop a little bit more than any time. Katherine George, Wealthtreme, advisors, senior advisor. Good to see you again. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks for having me. All right. Before we head to break, let's check in on shares of Elf Cosmetics after the poor quarter from S.D. Lauder on Wednesday. Elf put up put on its best face on the third quarter, topping profit estimates by 20 cents on the back higher prices and consumers trading down to 10%. The cheaper lip gloss and face scrubs, company lifted its full year sales guides to 22% to 24% from 14% to 16% previously. Jeffries, Alice Ashley, Helgans, notes that Elf is gaining shelf space at Target and Walmart ahead of the holiday shopping season as well. Elf won the show. Elf on the shelf. Go up. Very nice. That's a home run, Brad. Coming up, we'll speak with the CFL of Cheg. On the back of that earnings report, they sent the stock price exploding higher. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,56,2022-11-03 17:43:33
4766,". Let's get down to business now. Take a look at some of the other headlines we're watching. Food delivery service Instacart will pay out its first company wide cash bonus in December that's according to the Well Street Journal. That move aims to boost employee morale among its corporate team during the holidays following the company's decision to delay its public offering, the mid-tightening economic conditions. The move also signals a shift in its employee retention plans. The San Francisco-based company has historically given out equity rewards to keep workers. Amazon's executive chair Jeff Bezos and the two LLCs he uses to manage his investments and properties, they're being sued by former Housekeeper Mercedes-Marcetti's WADA. The woman who identifies as Hispanic claims she was subject to racial discrimination by Bezos' staff and also forced to work long hours in unsanitary conditions without rest or breaks, which led her and other Housekeeper, she says in the suit, to develop urinary tract infections. WADA has worked for wealthy and high-profile families for 18 years with no issues according to her lawyers. Meanwhile, lawyers representing Bezos' LLC say the claims have no merit. For Mercedes-CEO, Leslie Moonvez and CBS owner Paramount reached a $30.5 million settlement with the Office of New York's Attorney General, LaTisha James. The state alleged that Moonvez concealed multiple sexual assault allegations from regulators, shareholders, and the public for months. Moonvez stepped down in 2018 following those allegations. Paramount will pay $28 million to the state, 22 million of which will go back to CBS shareholders and 6 million to strengthen mechanisms for investigating sexual harassment claims. Moonvez himself must pay $2.5 million, which will also go to CBS shareholders. Thanks so much Julie. While homework helper, Cheg, they aced their third quarter and boosted its full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA as college enrollment begins to stabilize here a little bit more. Cheg's chief financial officer, Andy Brown joins us now. Andy, thanks so much for taking the time and helping us run through the quarter. If you've got to think of one catalyst that really sticks out to you within the business from this past period, what is that? Yeah, it's been an interesting 12 months for Cheg. And as you had mentioned, things we're seeing in the headwinds that we saw maybe a year ago have now stabilized. As far as catalysts with respect to Cheg, I mean, one of the things that we have been doing is pushing what I'll call offering our premium price option. We call the Cheg Study Pack. And we continue to see a great momentum there, adding more value to the study pack and more of our students are taking that premium price option. And that's had a very nice impact on not just our revenue growth, but our earnings. And as you saw in our report, we blew through our earnings and we raised our guidance quite significantly. When we think of the past two years, it's really changed the way that a lot of colleges, universities might think about where people can be educated from, how they can be educated, what type of opportunities that create for Cheg, even in kind of a Renaissance moment for education or kind of a new normal that we're heading towards. Well, you know, when we came to Cheg, our CEO came 13, 14 years ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,57,2022-11-03 17:47:44
4767," or kind of a new normal that we're heading towards. Well, you know, when we came to Cheg, you know, our CEO came 13, 14 years ago, I'm now in my 13th year here, we were a textbook renter, but our vision was always that we would offer many types of services online, and we used to use the term and continue to use the term that you bet on the inevitable. And the inevitable is that more and more things are going to be done online. And so we embarked upon offering subscription services, homework help services that were exactly how students wanted, and that is they're relatively inexpensive, they're online, they're available 24 by seven, and those are the types of services that students expect, and we continue to deliver, whereas, you know, the traditional college experience was all of the help was, you know, on campus, but that's not the modern student today. Well, I mean, I think a lot of people don't realize is that, you know, you may think of a traditional four-year residential school, but many of the students in today's environment are actually part-time students, they're commuting into community colleges. They don't have the ability to get help, you know, at the institution, and so we provide that opportunity to learn anywhere, anytime, any place. And Andy, you guys are also expanding more into things that have nothing to do with traditional students, that is college students, right? You're looking more to the corporate world as well. I know you have a partnership that allows companies to give their employees language learning. How big a part of your business is that, and how much are you looking to that business for growth? Yeah, so you've talked about our skills platform, and we've believed for a long period of time that, you know, while most of what we do today or have historically has been academic learning, we believe skills-based learning will play a much larger role, is playing a much larger role, and will continue to play at a larger role in the future. So to your point, we have several skills products. One is what we call our thinkful line of services, and then more recently language learning with BUSU. And we do work with a company called Guild, that then delivers those services to large corporations like Chipotle and a Wal-Mart and so forth. And more recently, what we announced on our earnings call is that we were going to be including our language skills services through Guild starting in 2023. So we do believe, you know, when you imagine, check, I'll call it two to three years or now, skills will be a much bigger part of our revenue and contribution. And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts, and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw an adjusted EBITDA in the positive. Where is that coming from? How are you guys achieving that? And what are some of your targets on that front? Yeah, so we've always focused on profitable growth. And that's always something that we've talked about at our company, and as you can see, we continue to do that. We had a nice beat in Q4. But inherently in our model, because we've got a fairly fixed content cost, and much of our users come through unpaid sources, it's just natural that as we scale, our margins will scale. And I'll just remind everybody, we're profitable across every line. It's not just EBITDA, it's not just non-GAP. We're GAP profitable. So we do believe that will continue. We're not going to put a cap on where that would be. We're not at a steady state profitability yet. We do believe that as we scale, we will continue to increase our margins. Andy, while we have you, this has been a significant year, perhaps the most significant that I can remember in terms of student loan debt relief. And kind of the conversation to advance the cost of college and reforming the high expenses that families and individuals incur. Perhaps from the Cheg Lens, you can give us your read through moving forward from here, where some of these costs can start coming down, given that Cheg was one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,58,2022-11-03 17:51:55
4768," families and individuals in Kerr. Perhaps from the Cheg Lens, you can give us your read through moving forward from here, where some of these costs can start coming down, given that Cheg was one of those platforms that ultimately can reduce the costs on the book front that were so extensive for a lot of college goers and education seekers. Yeah, so it is painful. And I think this is more of a, it pains me to see college students going to college taking on large debt. But then are unavailable to actually pay it off. And that's what you're seeing. So does that disconnect on the ROI? In many cases, not all cases, but in many cases the ROI. And I think that is a big part of what, as a society, we need to fix. What is the ROI of going to college? So we don't get into these situations where students, fundamentally can't pay that debt off, which is real simple. There isn't an ROI. On that particular student's education. So I think that's the fix that we need to do. And that still hasn't been accomplished. Andy Brown, thanks so much for being here. Cheg's Chief Financial Officer. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, retail round, I will break down some more earnings from Under Armour, Etsy and Crocs. All of them in the green. Look at that. That's on the other side of the break. I think it'll help you with the mealничant time. Don't worry. You know, certainly raise above and down, or I can't afford. And if you, in a sticks assessments, if you're not thinking about the goal of losing stands, the real goal to takeovers as a society, draw any gap between religion and culture. The economy. If you don't know ولres, if TEA DO us a contribute, you name us France. Come and not not believe us, raise your bodies saying we share, I'm going to do a little bit of the same.

I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I've got some retail movers for you now starting with crocs. Those shares are up 7% after third quarter results top estimates. The footwear company reported adjusted earnings of $2.97 share versus estimates of $261. The company also raised its guide for 2022. The enduring appeal of crocs never phrase I thought I would ever say. But that is what we've been saying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,59,2022-11-03 17:56:24
4769," It's gotten for 2022. The enduring appeal of Crocs never phrase, I thought I would ever say. But that is what we've been seeing. You're even as the company has been raising its prices, right? Definitely Crocs have gotten priceier. If you buy the gibbits, those little doohickeys that are on there from the company itself, super expensive, you can buy the knockoff ones wherever. But if you want the authentic ones from the company, that's also adding to their sales. I think you have to get past this notion that Crocs is a fad. They put, really, this is not a new quarter from Crocs under CEO Andrew Reese. This has been going on. I would argue for over two years, good quarter and the Crocs brand, good quarter and the Haydude brand. Maybe it didn't like that inventory bulged a lot, but that is, I think, keeping in line with what we've seen across retail. You can go to the Crocs website. I mean, they have these new crush boots out. They look pretty cool to me in my humble view. What I don't like is those, Brad, the Crocs with the furry lining. They have like stinky all over them. Ah, Andrew's going to like ding us, but I mean, I don't know. They just don't like the cross with the lining. It's not like you could remove the movie better if you could remove it to watch it. Right, yes, that's what those need. That's the new Adidas slide as well. I don't think that you can. You can remove that lining in the new Adidas slide, but in this Crocs one, yes. If you could remove that fire instantly. But I think the boot, actually, you don't like the boot. I do like the boot. I do like the boot. OK, I'm into the boot. I like it. I'm into the boot. There's a lot of things to like about this quarter as my computer goes flat. But the direct consumer front, I think, continued to just showcase how much people want to engage directly with the brand of Crocs. And particularly as you look through the entire kind of comfy, cozy landscape, Crocs has continued to run away not just during the pandemic, but among sentiment, even post-pandemic, as people are getting back into even some of the more kind of social constructs that they had pre-pandemic. Crocs has been, it's had some staying power quite frankly. And the specific partnerships that they've been able to drum up, whether that be with different brands, I think they had one with peeps, they had one with Justin Bieber as well. And so all of that considered, that's continued to pay dividends for them over time. And I'm getting the boots. You heard it here first. I'm going to get the boots. I think they just might be for women. I'm on the side. I can't tell. But they don't think any of their stuff is those gender specific. Yeah, OK. Most of it is unispecial. I mean, that look good on me. I am. I have been seeing some sale stuff on the site. I have to say. So that's something important to note because I didn't have a chance to look at their inventory numbers full disclosure. But they've definitely have been some sales stuff on there. So that's something to note. Yeah. And just to put a number on that direct consumer comparable sales, that was up 18.2% as I was able to log back into my computer. Let's also take a look at underarmour shares here on the day. Are they protecting this house? Yes, they are. All right. The only way is through. It's up by about 15%, 16%. Right now, the athletic wear company posted it slightly better than expected second quarter results. But cut back its guidance, citing the stronger dollar, and a, quote, more challenging retail environment. It's challenging indeed. You're taking a look at the actuals versus the estimates on your screen and turn around had to start sometime. But it's not a full turn around. I didn't see really any signs of a turn around. This is maybe this was the peloton turn around with the green shoots. Maybe Barry McCarthy should write this company's letter too as well. But look, they came out lower their guidance and one of the biggest concerns that's holiday season and retail is all the inventory sitting at various stores. And one of the most promotional brands in the store right now remains underarmour. And it's just not what this brand was founded on. I remember saving up a lot of money to buy my first moisture wicking underarmour. Sure, I had to pay full price. It was six or seven years ago. Maybe even longer than that. But still, you go now to TJ Maxx. You go to Marshall. This stuff is on sale, $10, $20 a pop. Well, and their inventory was up by 29%. So that, you know, but that's in line with what we've seen from others. They did cut the forecars, as you mentioned, but that forecast cut was largely expected. Analyst were saying they got to cut the forecast. So I guess their acknowledgement of reality was a good thing. Also, really surprising here, Asia Pacific sales up to 7%. Like who else had Asia Pacific sales up to that? Big and basketball. Yeah, they've been sending Steph Curry there every single summer to do a grassroots just boots on the ground. But still, given how shut down things have been there and given what we've been hearing from other companies, that's not been surprising. Remember, they still don't have a permanent CEO, by the way. Well, I remember Patrick Friskel-F. This has always been Kevin Planck's house. You covered on Armour too, as well.

4770, scholarships to Orange and Brown students of South Florida Stealing School successful to improve equity skills and their important community members are We're continuing to watch shares of the Qualcomm this morning after the company slashed its forecast for smartphone shipments and gave a glumir sales outlook for more let's bring in technologists research president chief analyst Bob O'Donnell Bob great to speak with you as always here all right we come out of this quarter and really kind of back out what they had to say and and really look through the core fundamentals of the business but also the trends in the market are persisting for them what really sticks out to you. Look Qualcomm has been on a journey of changing into a much broader company for several years now really but we're really starting to see it come into play but the fact of the matter is 56% of the revenue this last quarter was for smartphones right that's still a huge chunk and that's why there's been so much focus on you know their numbers and their expectations but as with the PC market we're seeing that the smartphone market is is taking this post pandemic dip and it's going to be difficult there's a bunch of inventory out there just as again we've seen with the PC guys there's a lot of similarities in terms of what's been happening out there on that front but you know they did have that automotive analyst day a couple weeks ago in New York talking about all the automotive business they have of course they're providing the chipset for the new vr headsets they're doing a number of areas because what they're able to do is leverage the technology they have particularly around things like modems and RF stuff that's really really hard to do as Apple is learning and apply that in a number of places they've had this in automotive for a long time you what are what's called the telematic systems and they've been driving that for a long time now as they have more advanced sensors that originally started in the smartphone market they're bringing that into into the automobile market and you know as we move to software defined cars and much more capabilities clock on and saying hey look you've been working with us for a long time anyway we're a natural entree for you to bring some of these advanced capabilities to digital cockpit to the Snapdragon ride that format that they have or excuse me that they have so you know it's this typical thing with semiconductors right now short term is pretty tough for just about all of them longer term those companies that have really diversified themselves I think have a really strong growth story qualcomm is one among them AMD of course similar type of situation they just reported earlier this week as well. What is this correction in the level of inventory when does that ease and start to improve. You know Brian I mean they said you know in the in the call they said it's going to be several quarters to get through that inventory again we're hearing relatively similar types of things from some of the other big semi folks so I think that's just a reflection of the fact that again a lot of people are slowing down the pace at which they with which they upgrade their their smartphones I mean let's think about it we're not seeing a whole lot of innovative smartphone designs you know everything is much more incremental we've had a few big jumps with foldables but so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,61,2022-11-03 18:08:39
4771," designs, you know, everything incremental. We've had a few foldables, but there's still a small piece of the market. You know, iPhones are evolving but again modest pace. So there isn't that overwhelming sense I have to have the latest new great smartphone. Now, there's still plenty of upside for 5G smartphones. You know, that's of course, we're call com, call com strength is typically been. So I think you're going to develop that market, but it's just going to be at a slower pace and keep we're going to have to get used to that in the short term remembering that there's still those long-term opportunities. Bob, hey, it's Julie here. I have to wonder about the implications for Apple, right? Because we keep getting these signs that smartphones sales are going to weekend. We got this is call com is just the latest. Apple shares today are down more than 3%. And I'm curious why is it going to be a good thing to have the market in the last for the smartphone market? You know, hey, Julie, I think it could be a while. I mean, I think, you know, we could be again, drawing analogies to the PC market, maybe not declining quite as rapidly, because PCs grew even more during the pandemic and therefore, unfortunately, are falling even more. But smartphones did reasonably well during the pandemic. But again, people are like, OK, I'm good for a while and I'm not going to be able to get it right now. That's really kind of hitting and when people have to make a decision, you know, if things get tough from a macro economic perspective, they're like, look, my phone is good. And you know, it's getting easier to get them repaired if you just want to replace the glass. Of course, because people do that all the time. So I just don't feel like there's this compelling desire until we start to see something really dramatically fall. Eventually, I think Apple may do something like that. That will add some pizzazz to the market. But I still think work a few years off. But to Apple's challenges that you mentioned, you know, they bought Intel's modem IP. That's the chip that allows you to do the communications with the cellular network. And it's hard stuff. I mean, RF is the radio frequency stuff is very difficult. There's really only two companies in the world that do well. It's Paul Common Media Tech. And Apple, you know, had plans to do their own modem, and they still will. It's just not they've already delayed it a year. And who knows if it goes even longer. So that's upside for Qualcomm that nobody expected to happen. So good for them. But offset, of course, by the fact that the overall market is still declining. If the metaverse takes office Qualcomm Net Beneficiary. Yes, it is. It is. I mean, because there are, you know, when we think about at least the standard metaverse, I mean, longer term we'll see. But near term, you know, they've got the chip that's powering the headsets. Again, there are a couple other competitors that Qualcomm by far is more advanced in that regard. But, you know, I mean, look at it now even, right? I mean, they put that in their IoT revenue. And it's still a small fraction of Qualcomm's revenue. So even if it explodes, it becomes a reasonable percentage of Qualcomm's revenue. That's a big, big amount of effort that we're going to have to happen. And I am going to have to have a third phone, which to me is just another example and reason why I think the metaverse as some people have touted it is a long way off. Bobo Donald, President Chief Annals. Now let's ask research. Always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks. Appreciate you having me.

Parent company restaurant brands saw global same-source sales climb 9% led by 10% rise at burger king and strong international growth restaurant brand CEO. Jose Sil is fresh with us off his earnings call. Jose happy national sandwich day to you my friend. You know we were talking earlier on in the show. Why a lot of companies like yours the burger players are doing better than the pizza guys. Why do you think that's the case? Well Brian thanks for having me great to be here on especially on national sandwich day also on our earnings day. By the way we have a Popeyes by one get one free sandwich chicken sandwich during this important national holiday. Look I we're excited obviously with the momentum in our brands in our business and we saw some really strong performance in the quarter that we we shared earlier in earnings. I think the I think our brands are well positioned in all moments in time right. We have great food great beverages at Burger King. Thames Popeyes and firehouse and we have we provide great experiences digital become a bigger part of our business. We have various service modes delivery drive through a dinin curb side and some restaurants. And we do so with our digital capabilities at a great value. So it's a compelling offer. It's why we grow on on frequency and it's the kind of the core element of our business model that's so exciting and we do so in good times and especially and certainly during challenging times. So I think we're well positioned to kind of benefit from tailwinds in difficult moments because of the business model the great franchisees that we have and the amazing food and beverages that we serve in our brands. Even as your customer base might be looking for value within this kind of error this environment right now where do you still need to or have you had to pass through price increases to customers that are looking for not just a good meal but also a good price steel if you will. Like I think you have to start with the acknowledgement that consumers are generally value driven value for money has always been a key driver of decision making in our category in the quick service or limited service restaurant space. That doesn't mean discounting necessarily but they're always looking for good value which means they're looking for for taste quality sometimes quantity and overall experience for what they pay and I.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,63,2022-11-03 18:17:17
4773," But they're always looking for good value, which means they're looking for taste, quality, sometimes quantity, and overall experience for what they pay. And I think we're very well positioned, as I mentioned earlier, to deliver consistently on those expectations from consumers. Today, consumers, and it's slightly different in the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. But broadly speaking, there's a ton of concern around the macro, right? Inflation, food at home, grocery prices are kind of outpacing inflation away from home. On the food category, gas prices are up, energy prices, especially in Europe, are quite steeply increasing. We haven't seen any trade down or trade out of our category. But we know that there is pressure in the consumer, and our business does well. Our brands do well when we serve great tasting products, great beverages at a good price. Even if we're having to raise prices to address some inflation, and what we do on that is that we make sure we understand CPI, and we know for the U.S., it's been around 8% for Canada, it's just under 7%, and slowing down a bit. We look at food away from home, and at home inflation, we look at a number of different data points. We talk to consumers, and then we take price to address input cost, but we do so in a way that's measured to ensure that we don't chase away our very important customers that are the key to our success alongside our franchisees. Jose, just given those pressures on consumers, do you need a six-item dollar menu? Well, look, I think having value and having a balanced menu is always important, Brian, we have a core offering, which is fundamental to success, is why people come to Burger King Popeyes, Tins, and Firehouse. They know those core items, and they're there consistently for those core items. We have premium offerings, which allow for indulgence and for those treats from time to time. Then we have value as an everyday proposition in each of our brands. We've had dollar menus or kind of entry-level ala-cart menus. I don't know if dollar is any longer the relevant price point, but having an everyday entry-level price point product that consumers can go to ala-cart and or to bundle, I think, is an important aspect of being a broad-based and very thoughtful restaurant business. That's something that we continue to explore and look at. Our teams are working on quality and product offerings at the right price that allow for customers to come in more frequently and enjoy our brands day in and day out. There's two and a half percent net restaurant growth when you think about the franchisees. What are you hearing from franchisees right now and even potential franchisees in different markets and how they're potentially looking to get into business with restaurant brands? We have a lot of excitement around growth in our business and fundamentally restaurant brands and our four amazing iconic brands are growth brands and growth businesses. We've got a lot of room for growth internationally for all four of our brands, even Burger King that has north of 12,000 restaurants in international markets. We've got a lot of room for growth. We think domestically with firehouse, with Popeyes, Tim's in the US is beginning to rev up their engines from a growth standpoint and obviously firehouse has a huge runway domestically as well. Franchisees are excited. They're obviously concerned in a near term with the impacts that we're seeing in inflation, commodity costs. That translates not only to food costs but also to construction costs. There's always a challenge around getting permitting and the process of getting approvals to move forward with new restaurant sites. We have a healthy pipeline. We have a lot of interest from existing franchisees as well as new franchisees to develop our brands domestically and internationally. We continue to work with our partners to move those pipelines along and continue to grow our businesses. We think we're on our way to our 40,000 restaurant goal with restaurant brands over the next several years. We have 10 seconds left and this is National Salon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,64,2022-11-03 18:21:23

Jose, I have 10 seconds left, and this is National Sandwich Day. Somebody's been out there touting their sales gains and any smack talk form. Look, our brands are awesome. We have Firehouse, Burger King, Tim's and Popeyes. I think they're the best in each of their categories in Burger Chicken, Coffee and Sandwich. And I'll let the customers decide who the best brands are. My focus is building a great team, working with the franchisees and delivering profitable opportunities for growth across the across our four brands. You're too nice Jose. You're too nice. Just too nice. Jose is a customer of Popeyes. I can say on this sandwich today that chicken sandwich is family. Thank you so much for joining us here on the show, Restaurant Brands International. Yeah, I was just gonna say, make sure you try the black and chicken sandwich, which is coming out on National TV and on the 7th of November. Awesome sandwich, really cool experience. It's a flavor of New Orleans all around the country. All right, so as you put it in his notes, so we're gonna have to do it. We're gonna do it. Restaurant Brands International CEO, Jose Sil, Jose, thanks so much as always. Thanks a lot. Have a great day. You too. Coming up everyone, Walmart is fighting back against Bryce Hikes this holiday season. We're gonna share the details on the rollback next. Here's to kind of call development and repair also. Also. Mhm. Mhm. Here at the Song, you know what time it is. Welcome back everyone. Time for a cup of time. For the stories one minute each. We start with this on the day, Marriott is joining its rival, Hyatt and Raising its annual profit forecast. Thanks to higher pricing and strong rebound in leisure and business travel despite recession risks pulling on consumer spending. It is remarkable how much we've seen the travel demand cited even outside of travel industry earnings reports. We were talking about Papa Johns earlier in today's show and them citing the return, the strong return of travel and how that impacted their business. And here we're also hearing from Marriott and Hyatt, similarly the same in that return of not just the leisure traveler but some corporate travel trickling back into. Yeah, I think we, this holiday season is going to be expensive to travel. We've heard it now from the airlines as you know we've now heard it from the hotels. Prices are going up and they were already hard to begin with. One of the reasons that Marriott might be down today, one analyst are Bernstein flagging the T-P.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,65,2022-11-03 18:26:08
4775," From the airlines, as you know, we've now heard it from the hotels. Prices are going up and they were already hard to begin with. One of the reasons that Maryott might be down today, one analyst of Bernstein flagging that the pipeline under construction is falling and falling again. So maybe that's part of the reason that the stock is down a little bit that there's some concern about the recovery of that going into next year of the net unit growth. All right, and Wayfair reported Q3 results. It's results. It beats slightly on revenue, but missed on earnings. It saw a dip in its active customer base and orders per customer. It's now looking for a break even EBDA in 2023. But we're seeing the shares up 9% nonetheless here. Pretty good market response here for Wayfair and Etsy. I think it was a market was expecting worse things from both companies and didn't get it. And I think also we're seeing this theme emerge that when companies are talking about cost cutting, when they're talking about a focus on profitability that the market likes that, even if the top line numbers or even if last quarter's numbers are looking pretty lousy. I mean, when you got a revenue drop of 9% and the stock is up 9%, I don't know. Yeah, and international was dismal. It was down 24% year over year. And now, of course, the business would be more challenged internationally within some of the areas that Wayfair does operate. But again, they said that they're continuing the work that they set out and really focusing on some of the controllables within Wayfair around driving cost of infancy, nailing basics, and earning customer and supplier loyalty. And finally, this morning, I think I took a few seconds ago, a little bit of maybe silver lining going into Thanksgiving Walmart is promising to sell a basket of Thanksgiving dinner ingredients. At last year's prices, that's a move to attract customers by easing the sting of soaring US inflation. That lower pricing will extend through December 26. It's going to apply to traditional holiday fare like whole turkeys, ham, stuffing, mixed cream, and some great stuff. Remember, our BriKtopoma recently told us what is it a 15% increase I believe overall in the Thanksgiving basket? So this is good news for people shopping Walmart. Is it good news for Walmart margins? Well, I already decided. I'm getting one of those black and chicken sandwich from Burger King for my Thanksgiving. Thanks, David. I'm ready to go. I'm going to actually buy ten of them and freeze them. You know, that will be our friends giving here on the set. We'll just do the chicken sandwich reviews, perhaps. Yeah. Let's do it. Welcome. Look, man. for Walmart here. You're not gonna come to Eburger King. I know you're not. How about you? I was thinking about you. I wasn't gonna invite you. I'm bringing the Popeye street sandwich. Family and Thanksgiving sauce. I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry. We can do a separate friend's giving. We can do a separate friend's giving. Oh, I just basically called me a loser on life TV. It's great.

4776," Fanfare Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11 a.m. in the east. It is here in the west. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. The ultimate level of interest rate will be higher than previously expected. Those comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell sending stocks falling. The S&P 500 extending its declines following the worst. Fed Day declines since January of last year. One of those stocks, haliton, shares their plummeting after reporting another dismo quarter. We're going to break down the numbers for you straight ahead. And we'll speak to the CEO of Lumenar Technologies. We're going to ask him about his Q3 results and what he's hearing from car makers. First though, we are doing a market check. As we said, we saw the big U-turn really in the session yesterday and we are seeing the declines continue. With the Dow down 84 points, the S&P 500 down 15 and the NASDAQ down 52 in terms of sectors we are seeing. Energy kind of the outlier here along with industrials and materials. And of course we are watching yields very closely given the back of that Fed decision that came down yesterday. 10 year yield there. Take a look at that at 415. Let's bring in Jared Blyckery for a deeper dive on the market today. Jared, how are things looking? Things are looking a little odd. I'm not going to say dismal but a little bit red on the U.S. Frontier. You can see the NASDAQ leading the way down about half a percent so not a disaster here. But let me take you inside some of the moves that we've seen in the currency markets. Now first I want to start with the British pound because we had a bank of England decision overnight where they raised interest rates there on the short end of the spectrum by 75 basis points. Sound familiar? That's what the Fed did yesterday but what's different is that the bank of England signalling that they're pretty much done and that markets had anticipated them continuing to raise rates. However, that was a mistake on part of market participants. And so their currency is actually losing value with respect to the U.S. dollar is down 1.5 percent. It might be a little bit hard to see this chart here. This is a three month chart of the British pound versus U.S. dollar and we can draw this trend line here. It has broken down so it is racing back down towards parity with the U.S. dollar. Now this gives a little bit of breathing room perhaps to the UK people however you got to imagine that inflation going to rear its ugly head once again they are in a worse situation by the U.S. with recession they're considered pretty much imminent if they're not in it already. I want to show you the 10 year Tino yield now. It's up to 4.14 percent the five year even higher 4.36 percent and then on the very short end of the spectrum the 13 week T bill yield a bit less than those two so we have the yield curve expanding on the very short end. Now what I want to show you is also the U.S. dollars is going to be inverse to what we're looking at in the pound so it is stronger by 1 percent and by the way these are 20 plus your highs so the U.S. dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,67,2022-11-03 18:34:38
4777," I show you is also the US dollars is going to be in verse to what we're looking at in the pound. So it is stronger by 1% and by the way these are 20 plus your highs. So the US dollar has been giving stocks and other risk markets quite a bit of trouble lately and that is a case today as well. You can see tech communication services really taking on the chin here down about 1.3% energy in the green today but look at over the last two days. We can see the mega cap sectors. These three down here down three four almost five percent and that's really reflected in the Nasdaq 100. This is again over two days. Apple down six and a half percent Amazon a little bit less meta down 5% so is alphabet. Just show you what's happening today. A little bit better picture but looking at some losses here guys. So we'll have to see what comes of this into the close. Okay still early on in the session here. Thanks so much for that Jared. Well let's take a deeper dive here now on the Fed after the decision to raise rates again by another 75 basis points. Fed share power warning levels of US interest rates will go higher than previously projected. Take a listen. At some point as I've said in the last two press conferences it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2% goal. There is significant uncertainty around that level of interest rates. Even so we still have some ways to go and incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected. With more on the road ahead for the Fed look at the Yahoo finances Jennifer Schomburger and Jen we saw the reaction of the markets yesterday but certainly the Fed share making pretty clear that there the data is just not where they want it to be. Good morning Kiko that's right Fed share pal setting the table to begin slowing down the pace of rate hikes but says the question of when to moderate the size of rate increases isn't as important as ultimately how high the central bank will ultimately raise the Fed funds rate to team inflation. Pal says interest rates will now rise higher than forecast until the Fed gets to a level that's quote sufficiently restrictive. All this means the interest rate projections for ending rate hikes around the level of 4.6% forecast back in September are now too low. So the question is how much higher do they go from here? Well Roberto Parley who was a long time Fed watcher over at Piper Sandler says he thinks the peak rate could rise to 4.8% at minimum that we says the Fed can't continue hiking at 75 basis points every meeting which is why they're looking to slow down if they did they would reach 10.6% by the end of next year. Now the market is pricing in a peak Fed funds rate of 5.15% in June of next year. That's about 20 basis points higher than before the Fed meeting will steth a bond portfolio manager over at Wilmington Trust says he thinks the terminal rate might not also be higher but also stay higher for longer than what the market is expecting given that the Fed hasn't seen progress on inflation like they would. Now pal says he doesn't think the central bank is over tightened but perhaps the risk of continuing to raise rates aggressively risks cratering the economy which is why the Fed is looking to slow the pace of rate hikes so the economy can better digest those. Indeed Alice over at Bank of America say that policy lags complicate the ability of the Fed to judge their prior actions on the economy and that now that they're moving into more restrictive territory the risk reward trade off favors smaller rate hikes going forward. I can go. Okay certainly a lot to look ahead to thanks so much for that Jen. Well let's keep the conversation going on the Fed and what this means for investors we've got Priya Mestra, TD Securities Managing Director and Global Head of Rate Strategy. It's interesting here Priya when you look at the market reactions yesterday it felt like there was a bit of a resetting of expectations after there was so much hope on a potential head fed pivot or a pause. Now that we heard from Jay Powell where do you put the terminal rate and when does it all end? Sure thanks for having me so it was a nuanced message that the Fed was trying to convey yesterday. Slow a pace but potentially higher end point and the focus remains.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,68,2022-11-03 18:38:41
4778," Thanks for having me. So it was a nuanced message that the Fed was trying to convey yesterday, slow a pace, but potentially higher end point. And the focus remains squarely on inflation. And how quickly does it decline? You know, does it decline? How sticky is it on the way down? And so we actually revised up our terminal rate focus. We were in the 5% cam before yesterday. Now we're thinking 5 and a half by May of next year. And then the Fed keeps it there because, you know, inflation is extremely broad based. It has been sticky on the upside. We think it's going to take a while for it to come back down. And I'm we're taking the Fed at their word. They're committed to getting inflation down. And so we think they're going to struggle to ease or even stop hiking until their clear signs that inflation has downshifted. And so, you know, we think they're going to continue to raise rates. I do think that the risk of recession has become even greater because, you know, there are the, there are lags that the Fed cannot see that data right now. They the impact of policy tightening. They're going to continue to tighten. And I think, you know, as the economy starts to slow down, their task becomes a lot harder because if inflation is high, even if the unemployment rate is rising, I think we can't get a preemptive Fed that can start to ease. So it makes the risk of a downturn by in the second half of next year. Very high. We're actually looking for a recession in the second half of next year. And then that the Fed starts the easing process really in 2024. So it's going to be a tough couple of years as the two conflicts of the Fed, I think the two goals of the Fed are in conflict. When you say the risk of a recession is higher, I mean, how much more significant? If you're already looking at a recession in the second half of the year, how is that different from where you were going into the meeting yesterday? Sure. So I think we would anyway know this about a recession because it's not just the Fed funds rate. You look at the tightening and financial conditions or you look at the tenure. Most of us borrow at the 5 to 10 year part of the curve and those rates have risen significantly and it's been a real rate driven increase. So we were anyway concerned that things are slowing. I think which I pal, I think reinforcing the inflation commitment, not giving any room to letting lags play out or being willing to tolerate a slightly high inflation for a longer period of time. I think these were all things that the market that's been waiting for a pivot was hoping for. And that's why we saw that big reaction the statement because it looked like the Fed was at least nodding to lags. But then it turns out no, there might be nodding to the lags too for the pace of hikes, but not for the end point. And that makes the chance that the Fed takes rates higher. That's why we revised our terminal rate. 5 and 1,500, QT is also continuing so that can keep pressure on that belly of the curve or the tenure, and that makes the chance of hard landing higher. And I would say the market is under the impression it's a short, shallow recession, well, if you don't get any monetary help and I don't think we're going to get any fiscal easing, this idea of a short, shallow recession I am pushing back against that I think it could need not be a wait but a recession that can last for a while because you just don't get that policy support that I think we've been used to the other month. The market's been used to getting some help and I think that help is going to be much harder in a high inflation environment. Yeah, so the warning certainly elevated for investors who are out there. Priya, you pointed to the fact that there's always a lag factor with Fed policy and we certainly heard from the Fed Jerry Estarday acknowledging that we're now into what four-stray jumbo size hike. We, to what extent have we already seen that we've been able to get the vaccine that take hold and how much of a lag factor are you looking at? Sure, so I think there's a shorter lag between Fed policy and financial conditions. I think transparency, the fact, the dot plot, the communication from the Fed makes the, I think, market price in Fed policy in a better way. Of course, Fed policy itself has been extremely hard to call. I mean, they've changed their dot plot significantly every dot plot this year. So, I think that's a good thing. I think the financial conditions are pricing it in somewhat appropriately. I think what is unknown is how quickly does inflation come down. And if it is sticky, I do think there's going to be more financial conditions tightening because that means that the Fed is going to keep going potentially even higher than our forecast of five and a half on the terminal rate. But then there's the big question on when does the economy respond to it? And we've had the question on when does the economy respond to it? And we've had",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,69,2022-11-03 18:43:26
4779," means that the Fed is going to keep going potentially even higher than our forecast of five and a half on the terminal rate. But then there's the big question on when does the economy respond to it? And we've had this big white savings buffer that the consumer has had, that is buffer is dwindling, that that buffer is dwindling. So over the course of next year, we think more in the second third quarter that the consumer starts to pull back. And that's what we will start to result in a recession. The labor market will start to cool down. So, you know, I think the lags might be there's a lot of talk that the lags might be shorter. I think for financial markets, I get that. But I think for the economy, the lags actually might be longer because the consumer has a savings buffer. So the labor market's going to look tight until that savings buffer is gone and service demand starts to slow down. And we think that's the second quarter, third quarter time frame next year. So, which is why the Fed has free rein to keep raising rates really into the face of recession. So either way you look at it, all signs pointing to more pain ahead. Priya, it's good to get your insights today. Priya, Miserade, TD Securities Managing Director and Global Head of Rate Strategy. What is time now for our trending ticker. And today we're taking a look at shares of Roku, getting a 52 week low today, down about 8%, despite beating estimate in its latest quarter. The streaming firm warning it expects the macro environment, the pressure consumer discretionary spend further and a great advertising budget. The company expects these conditions to be temporary, although it says it's difficult to predict when they will stabilize or rebound. Roku's now forecasting fourth quarter total in that revenue of roughly $800 million and lower year on year player and platform revenue. So, Mia, deep decline in broke who shares today. Well, coming up, it is another rough day in what has been a brutal year for palatine investors after the company issued disappointing guidance. We're going to take a closer look at the numbers on the other side of the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,70,2022-11-03 18:47:37
4780," Shares of Peloton coming off of the lows of the session, but still down more than 3% after the company issued weak guidance for the holiday quarter. The company CEO says, quote, the ship is burning. Joining me now to break down the results. We've got City, senior analyst and managing director Ron Josie. Okay, so we can focus on the negative. We know this has been a turnaround story for some time, but I want to flip the question and start with what I think could be a positive. You say this is sort of the turnaround story is starting to take hold. And we did hear from CEO Barry McCarthy today saying that we're done now in terms of flashing headcount. I mean, what's the silver lining out of this report if there is any? Yeah, no, OK, go. It's a good question. I mean, because we can talk about the negatives for a while here. And there's some things that we definitely need to be aware of, but the bottom line is churn improved in the quarter. We have newer distribution models with third parties like Amazon and Dix on top of Amazon's top of pelton's first party that that should help drive continued growth. You have a cost base that is significantly reduced. I think employees are down over 50% really since February. So really what you have here is a streamlined business that has a tremendously engaged member base where churn is coming more in line with historicals after the pricing increase. And you have visibility, at least we think there's visibility in the greater overall or positive free cash flow towards the end of this fiscal year. So in the back half of this year. So the silver lining here is look, turn around your heart. We know that churn is improving. That suggests engagement remains strong. And frankly, these newer things that the business has been doing in terms of third party partnerships, their rental program with fast things along those lines. They should improve overall results over the next couple quarters going forward. Sure, the earnings results specifically asking about free cash flow guidance. And what made the leadership team feel confident about beating the one year timeline? I mean, how confident are you in their strategy? Did you feel like you got to satisfy your answer? Yeah, no, it's a really good question. I think the answer is yes, right? I think when you think about the changes that have happened in this business, and really just the last six to nine months between the multiple rifts between basically going from insourcing or being a verticalized strategy from creating your own bikes or manufacturing your own bikes, delivering them yourself to outsourcing all of that, this business has gone through a tremendous amount of change. And so as we take this step back and we think about where we are today, the cost base is much lower. So in other words, the variable cost structure is certainly better. The member base is seems to be stabilized, which is strong. And that gets to engagement at the end of our day. Then the day our core thesis here is that engagement drives everything in this business. And our view here is that those members that are on the bike stay on the bike for a while here. And it's something that we haven't really seen in other type of consumer subscription models. So that's positive. And then you add to that, you know, we're going into the holidays with newer distribution partners. And so all this combined should help drive better free cash flow in the years. We just talked about, but does it give us more confidence? I think the answer is yes. Now, to be clear, there's changes in this business, right? So the fast business or the rental bike business, it will change the structure of when Peloton generates the revenue. Their distribution partners, third part of distribution partners with Amazon and Dix will have a lower overall selling price because it's more of a wholesale partnership for the most part. That'll impact revenues. But I think the profitability should start showing up here over the next couple quarters. And naturally, the key thing of proving out the viability in the business here. So the top line seems to be stable, at least in subscribers. That's a good, that's good. And overall costs are pretty much taken out. So we're leaner, more streamlined organization that should drive a greater overall profitability and sustainability in the business. Finally, really quickly, this doesn't change the fact that this is a stock that has seen it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,71,2022-11-03 18:51:43
4781," for all costs are pretty much taken out. So we're leaner, more streamlined organization that should drive a greater overall profitability and sustainability in the business. Finally, really quickly, I mean, this doesn't change the fact that this is a stock that has seen a steep fall this year. We're now looking at $8.47 a share. If the turnaround strategy's working and you feel like things are taking hold, is this kind of where fair value should be? So, I mean, it's a good question. Our price target, you know, published is certainly higher. When if you would strip out everything and just look at the subscriber base and where churn where it is, the 1.2% X some one time things like, you know, there's a lot of value in that subscriber base. And as a result, we think there's a lot of value in this business and we think shares are not reflecting that because the turnaround's take time, especially one of this magnitude, especially one that, you know, went through the pandemic with massive demand being pulled forward and now we're when a completely different environment and macros coming up here as we just heard your prior guest talk about in terms of concern. So, you know, from a fair value perspective, we think there's room to go on shares. That said, we understand it's a turnaround strategy. There's a lot of moving pieces here. We want to see that free cash flow better. Our model suggests we could get there or we can get there. And that's really what's gonna drive shares here. The next call it 12 months or so. And that's our vision or longer term focus on the name. Ron Josie, senior analyst and managing director at that he always good to have you on a appreciate your insight today. Thanks, Akiko. Likewise. And we've got much more earnings to dive into. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexander Seminova. Alexander, you know, we've gotten so much negative news out of this. And can we sort of take away some positive here, especially when you're looking at the retailers that have reported so far? Absolutely, Akiko. It's another big morning for corporate earnings with a flurry of retailers headlining today's results. Among them is Crocs shares are up about 7%. After the footwear company reported third quarter figures that beat Wall Street estimates, quarterly sales and direct to consumer comparable sales rose sharply as well as revenue for its hey, dude, brand up 87%. During the period, the company raised its full year guidance with CEO Andrew Reese citing strong back to school performance. And 20% constant currency revenue growth in its Crocs brand. Let's turn now to under armor, also beating estimates for the quarter, but signaling a less optimistic view of what's ahead for the company. The sports brand said sales for the 2023 fiscal year are set to rise in the low single digits that's down from the 5% to 7% it projected earlier. The company attributed lower expectations to quote a more challenging retail environment and additional negative impacts from changes in foreign currency and BMO analyst Simeone Segal, who is a friend of the show telling us this morning that he believes shares are still priced too low. He reiterated his outperform rating on the stock this morning. And speaking of some positive takeaways here, we've got Etsy, that stock just on a tear today up well over 10%. What's feeling the rally there? Well, Akiko results signal today to investors that e-commerce is still holding a better than expected, especially ahead of the all important holiday shopping season at CZ Revenue came in at $594.5 million. That's up 11.7% from a year ago gross merchandise sales down slightly, but still at the higher end of the projected range, the online marketplace also said it expects continued strength in its sales into the fourth quarter. That's helping lift shares today. Analyst from Evercore ISI this morning saying the company maintained its pandemic success and is showing healthy levels of profitability as well. OK, some still religning there to take away. Thanks so much for that. Alexander, some of Nova. Well, coming up on the other side, Elon Musk reportedly planning a length of half of Twitter staff.

4783, you Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. I'm Sean Smith. Let's get you up to speed on today's market action. It's just about an hour to go until the closing bell. Dow actually now imposit territory up just around 29 points recovering from the losses earlier in the session. Take a look at the S&P. That's still in the red. Off just about a fourth of a percent because the in the intraday chart well off the lows of the session as well. Nasdaq 100 still remains in the red. The worst performer of the three averages off just over one percent. Some of those big tech names leading today's decline. We'll take a look at that here in just a second. Let's first take a look at the bond market yield pushing higher once again the two year yield which is obviously the most rate sensitive yield. That's hitting the highest levels that we've seen since July 2017 taking over the 10 year yield. Pushing higher once again up seven basis points to 413. Taking a look at the US dollar index. That's pushing higher once again. Just below one 13. I also want to pull up the pound here as we talk about the news that we got from overseas. The bank of England raising rates by 75 basis points also the warning of a recession the stark warning there from the bank of England. That's pushing the dollar lower once again again. Again. Excuse me pushing the pound lower against the dollar. And you can see that reflected in the intraday chart. Taking a look at some of the action that we're seeing on a sector basis. Let's start with the Nasdaq 100 because again some of those larger cap tech names leading today's decline. We're looking at Apple off just over 3% as well as alphabet Google there Amazon lower for the seventh trading day in a row Microsoft off just around 1.6%. Taking a look at the Dow industrial the largest decline is there obviously the same story there with the larger cap tech names but we are seeing some of those industrial names of value stocks holding onto getting a look at Honeywell for example up just around 2.6% on an intraday basis Boeing leading the way there up just about 7% sector action. Taking a look at all 11 of the SMP sectors energy industrials leading the way technology communications lagging in today's action that's okay technology ETF off just over 2%. Despite another rate hike from the Fed mortgage rates having slipped below 7% again that's according to Freddie Mac the 30 year fixed rate mortgage average at 6.95% that's down from last week's 7.08% for context though it's still more than double from just a year ago when it average 3.09%. Freddie Mac's chief economist saying that quote unsure buyers navigating an unpredictable landscape keeps demand declining while other potential buyers remain sideline from an affordability standpoint worth noting mortgage rates attract the yield on the 10 year treasury note versus muring the Fed's interest rate hikes a 10 year ticking up since the Fed's announcements and mortgage rates may follow suit in the coming days. Again just around 57 minutes to go until the closing bell Dow back in positive territory but still looking at losses from the SMP and the Nasak we want to bring in Brad McAmillan coming wealth financial network chief investment officer Brad it's great to see you so certainly I guess a different day is we'll get the doubt up just around 13 points following yesterday losses although Nasak still clearly in the red what do you make of the trading action that we've seen over the last 24 hours. You know it's interesting Shawna because we see this movie over and over again the Fed comes out and says we're going to keep hiking rates into inflation stops and the market starts to talk to itself and says well maybe they're really going to pivot. And the Fed says no we're really going to keep hiking rates in the market goes down and then the same thing happens this is just the latest.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,74,2022-11-03 19:04:39
4784," starts to talk to itself and says, well, maybe they're really going to pivot. And then the Fed says, no, we're really going to keep hiking rates and the market goes down. And then the same thing happens. This is just the latest iteration. It's about interest rates. It's about the Fed. It's not about the economy. It's the market reacting to the Fed. And we're going to keep seeing this until inflation comes back down. We're going to keep seeing this until inflation comes back down. It seemed like the market was looking for any sort of hope here, any sort of good news from the Fed. And we certainly saw that reflected in the action after the decision was announced. And then when Fed Chair Jay Powell's a press conference got underway in terms of what the Fed has done so far, the latest rate hike and what we could see over the next month or two at the next two meetings. Do you think the Fed is potentially being too aggressive at this point? I think there's a real chance we're going to see the economy get hit very hard towards the middle of next year. There is the lag on these hikes. They've been very severe, very fast. But that's actually what the Fed is looking for. They're looking to see things come back. We are seeing some slowing growth, but we're not seeing it in the jobs market. And that's, I think, what the Fed is waiting for to declare victory to see the jobs market really soften in a material way. They want to see people being able to shop and buy, go down. So that's what I'm watching for as a signal that we are close to the end. And, Brad, certainly, even from the dead out this morning, it doesn't seem like the jobs market is losing steam at the rate clearly that what the Fed would have liked to see. What are you expecting to see in the next jobs report tomorrow? And then looking out, I guess, to what you think the Fed should do at the next meeting. What do you think should be on the table? I think they should do 50 basis points in the next meeting. And then 25 after that. In other words, keep the pressure on. But at the same time, recognize just how much damage has been done. When you look at the residential investment figures, if we do get a recession, it's very likely to be investment driven. And that's actually better for the average work, or so I'm OK with that. But right now, with all the tightening they've done, I would step back and wait. The problem is the market will love that. And that's not what the Fed wants to see either. Yeah, clearly not what the Fed wants to see. And that was all that reflected in the commentary from Fed Chair Jay Powell. A yesterday afternoon, Brad, you mentioned the risk of a recession. If we do, in fact, see a recession, I guess, how deep of a recession do you think we could potentially get? I think we probably will see a recession at this point. But I'm not taking a soft landing off of the table. And the reason I'm saying that is, as long as you have this many people working, as long as you have a job market, as strong as this one is, it's very hard to get a consumer-led recession that's anything meaningful. We are seeing investment go down. We're seeing housing go down. That could take us into technical recession. But if we do get a recession, I think it's going to be short, maybe a quarter or two, and probably no worse in the recession we had last year, two week orders, and then things will normalize. And Brad, we did hear from Fed Chair Powell that that path for a soft landing has definitely narrowed. What is the investor position here as people all racing for a potential recession? Well, I think you have to certainly have to stay defensive. You know, personally, I'm working at health care. I'm working at consumer staples. I want to be fading the consumer, because as I say, I don't think that's where the principal risk is going to be. When you look at it from an investment standpoint, if the Fed is saying we're going to keep raising rates, and if you believe them, that's going to keep the pressure on growth stocks. That's going to keep the pressure on, especially tech stocks, and we're seeing that in the market. So I think it's a time to stay defensive. I think it's a time to focus on value and dividends. I think it's a time to focus on stocks that actually benefit from the average consumer. So I think they're going to continue to do OK. What do you make of earnings using so far? I guess given tech stocks, you didn't mention that. They weren't one of your picks, at least as of right now. And I think a lot of investors would agree with that sentiment. But from the slowdown that we've seen from a lot of those tech giants and the volatility, really, that we've seen in some of those bigger names so far today, and the heels of the latest rate hike from the Fed, what do you think that signals just in terms of the volatility that we could potentially see within that sector over the coming months? Well, you've got to remember that really, there's two things going on here. There's the earnings. And obviously, there's been some material news on a number of the tech companies for earnings. But it's not really about earnings for them. It's about valuation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,75,2022-11-03 19:09:08
4785," There's two things going on here. There's the earnings. And obviously, there's been some material news on a number of the tech companies for earnings. But it's not really about earnings for them. It's about valuations. And that's very tough to call because that depends on the expectation of rates. That depends on the expectation of growth. So you get volatility when there's uncertainty. And there's two different dimensions of uncertainty around the growth stocks. Now, when you, this gets back to the value stocks, they're going to be principally about earnings and there you have a little bit more visibility. But until we have some clarity of our interest rates, I don't think the, even if the tech stocks continue to grow their earnings or do well with earnings, that still doesn't address the valuation problem. And, but obviously, we knew that that 75 basis point height was already priced in yet. Once again, we saw the markets reacting negatively. Even though obviously, FedGFL has said we're going to say the course multiple times here, what does it think you think the markets are missing when it comes to risk assessment? Well, I think it's the triumph of hope over experience. And I said this a little bit earlier, Paul has said very clearly that no, we're going to keep hiking rates until inflation is under control. And the market said, no, he really means we're going to pivot. And then he had to come out at Jackson Hole and say the same thing. And markets went down. And then the last Fed meeting, in this Fed meeting, if you look at the projections by economists, they keep saying, oh no, but rates are really going to start coming down in a couple of months. And that continues not to be the case. I think the best thing we can do as investors is to take the Fed at its word, to say that no, we're not going to see a pivot until we see inflation come down meaningfully. You know, right now they have no reason to pivot. They have no reason to stop. Job, the jobs market is still very, very healthy. Inflation is still way too high. Why on earth would they stop? And I think we just have to accept that that's not going to happen until one of those two things breaks. Hence the phrase don't fight the Fed.

4786,"itä<|ru|><|translate|> trick cannabals thirteen ale eight nine An eight g municip eight Fresh signs of weakness in the tech industry, more rounds of sweeping job cuts and hiring freezes. Amazon shares low as it pauses corporate hiring in anticipation of an economic slowdown. In the right-hailing space, also lift cutting 13% of employees, which amounts to roughly 680 workers. It's the second round of cuts this year and comes after hiring freeze was announced back in September. And payment process as Stripes says it's getting ready for quote, leaner times, causing more than 1000 jobs. It all makes for grim reading. The finance is down how it has the latest hit. So Dan, break this down for us. Yeah, it really is kind of this all around push that we're seeing in the tech industry for some kind of cost cutting measures and it seems like right now they're going for employees. So as you said, we had Stripe. They're basically announcing the CEO saying they're going to lay off 14% of their workforce. They said that they over hired for the world that they're in and it pains them to be unable to deliver the experience that they had hoped. Lift saying they're laying off those 683 employees. That's about 13% of the workforce there. We also had Amazon announcing that they're having a hiring freeze. This is new incremental hires that they're going to be freezing. They previously said that they were freezing corporate hiring for its retail business. So another kind of freeze there. And then we've had some reports that obviously Twitter is going to be doing some layoffs. This isn't necessarily related in the same way to the kind of spending cuts that other companies are doing. But in a way, it is they're looking at potentially 50% of the workforce being cut as Elon Musk assumes control of the company. So you can only imagine the other kinds of moves we're going to see from companies as far as hiring freezes or straight up layoffs. Right now, a number of them have said that they will do hiring freezes. We had intel previously saying that they were going to be cutting positions, but they haven't come out with anything concrete yet. But it seems like this is going to be something that we'll have to continue to follow as we did during the summer when the same thing was happening. Yeah, Dan, I guess compared what we're hearing now to what we did here in the summers, is there anything different just in terms of the rhetoric that's coming from some of these larger companies? And I guess the biggest headwinds facing the tech industry, we talked about the slowing advertising business. Obviously, that's having a direct impact. Also rising competition, just to name a few of the challenges out there in front of these larger companies. Yeah, I think the rhetoric is that they're trying to ensure that people recognize that it's a short term issue, not a long term issue with these companies. So Amazon saying that while they're freezing hiring for now, they're still going to be hiring in 2023. A lot of companies saying that they're going to be backfilling positions. So they're not going to just stop hiring wholesale, but they are cutting back. And I think what this really is, is their reaction to the macro environment now, recognizing that there will be improvements in the coming months or quarters. It's just not happening right the second, and they have to do something right the second. So what they're doing is they're going for these types of job cuts. And they've recognized, obviously, that they're going to have to pay for some of these, especially in the case of companies like Lyft. But as far as the freezes go, I'd rather my company be freezing hiring than laying off. Yeah, certainly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,77,2022-11-03 19:18:02
4787," especially in the case of companies like Lyft. But as far as the freezes go, I mean, look, I'd rather my company be freezing hiring than laying off. Yeah, certainly if you're a current employee, that's a much better scenario. And obviously, these tech names have been under pressure since the start of the year. And more headwinds, as if it continues to raise rates. So we will stay on that story right. Dean Halley, thanks so much. Thank you. All right, turning to crypto, fidelity opening up commission-free trading to retail investors. The platform will allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ether. And it comes after Robinhood and Binance, US offered similar services. And fidelity is also giving some customers in its 401k plans, the option to invest in crypto. Now, it's the largest 401k administrator with more than $3 trillion in assets under management. But it has not disposed details on which companies are offering crypto investments to their employees. As of now, fidelity's competitors in the space, including T-Row price and Vanguard, do not have plans to add crypto offerings, citing weak demand.

Coming up, the current state of the housing market is giving many first time home buyers headaches. We're on the challenges they're facing next. Aha, a empresarial crisis.

As demand increased and rates were low, we all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was. The market was prices going up, many, many bidders, no conditions, that kind of thing. So the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. That was Fedger J. Powell on the housing market. Just after he announced another 75 basis point ratehead Yahoo finances, Daniel Romero joining us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,78,2022-11-03 19:22:10
4788," And that was Fedger J. Powell on the housing market just after he announced another 75 basis point rate, I get who finances Daniel Romero joining us now and Danny. We've been hearing a lot from J. Powell just the fact that the housing market is so far out of balance. What exactly does the Fed want to see happen? Look, the Fed can't force more home builders to build more homes, right? But what the Fed can do is adjust interest rates with which tend to impact the ability and willingness for home builders to build more homes. So essentially the Fed has more power on the demand side of things than the supply side of things. If anything the supply side from what I've been hearing would need more of the administration's influence to weigh in. That's what experts have been telling me. And Danny, we know that the Fed is data dependent. So what metric is the Fed considering when then really figuring out the supply and demand balance? There's not one specific metric that the Fed is looking at especially when they're assessing the health of the labor market as well as the trends of inflation. But specifically on the housing front, you know rent data, rent prices, they want those to come down. They want mortgage applications to come down. They want the number of homes being purchased above their asking price to come down to those normal levels. And Danny, when you talk about those normal levels, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out exactly what that looks like. Can you give us an insight, I guess, into what would indicate a healthy housing market? Yeah. So home prices need to grow at the rate of inflation. So theoretically everything needs to grow to that 2% rate, you know, over the long term. So essentially, you know, the Fed doesn't want to see that 10% to 20% home price appreciation that they saw during the pandemic. I mean the Fed yesterday made it pretty clear their goal is to bring down inflation, which we're already seeing it in the housing market. Certainly. I'm seeing a lot of pain in the housing market. Sounds like there is much more to come right. Danny Romero, thanks so much. All right. Well joining us now for another perspective on the housing market is Bruce McNeilidge. Kimlock Partners, co-founder and CEO Bruce, thank you for joining us this afternoon. As we're seeing though, even though the Fed, good to have you, even though the Fed raising rates were seeing the 10-year yield ticking up mortgage rates. So for the 30-year fixed, ticking below 7%. Help us understand the correlations here. Sure. So the 10-year treasury doesn't necessarily affect the payments of commercial debt and what builders are paying, but certainly it's going to affect interest rates for the average person. And right now, actually, the rates as of yesterday were right around 7.25 and that really hurts the entry level home buyer significantly because they barely can afford a house right now with the cost of housing going up because of supply chain and materials. And as that house goes up in price, it's knocking more and more buyers out of having the ability to purchase a home and they either have to rent a home or stay in the home that they're currently in. Bruce, just what your assessment on the damage that the Fed has caused in the housing market? And I guess any concern that the Fed is doing too much with what it sounds like more rate hikes on the table? Sure. So it's really going to be a trickle-down position where people are not going to be able to buy houses. It's going to hurt mortgage brokers. It's going to hurt bankers. It's going to hurt realtors. Really hurt people. And I think what the situation was, people were not ready for this. It turned down a dime and really changed significantly more quicker than most people would have expected. So builders are still building houses but they can't sell houses. And that's really putting builders in a position where they have to discount houses. And with the Fed raising things, again, as quick as they they have done, it's hurting folks in the residential real estate business significantly. And it's going to take them many months, if not a year or two, to catch up because of what they've done at the Fed Reserve. So then Bruce, this supply and demand balance that the Fed is looking for. How far out do you see that being? So what it's going to do is it's going to not developers back because if banks aren't loaning money to developers or developers or skittish on developing land, that's going to put builders back several years because you have to develop a land before you build the houses. And so during this time, builders can't get commercial loans or interest rates are going up for the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,79,2022-11-03 19:26:24
4789," Builders back several years because you have to develop the land before you build the houses. And so during this time builders can't get commercial loans or interest rates are going up for those loans. Same thing with developers, there are having problems getting loans. And that's basically going to end up again a year, two, three years in the future. It's going to have a ripple effect because it's going to cost folks money and it's also going to cost folks a lot of time because they have to catch up because of the slowdown in the economy that the fed is creating. Bruce, we spoke to you about a month ago. You told us that traffic had been falling off just in terms of demand out there. We saw a little bit of relief, I guess, in mortgage rates this morning, although not too far below that 7% number there has demand declined even further over the last couple of weeks from your perspective. I'm actually in one of my new houses we just bought from a builder right now. And demand has not wane. The demand is still there. The entry level home buyer, the millennial they want to own a house. The problem is the houses are without a reach. They might have been saving and looking at paying a three or four percent interest rate and budgeting for that. But now that the rates are up to seven percent, it really forces those people that were working hard and saving for a house. It really knocks them out of the market and it's making tougher for all people to afford a house. And unfortunately that has a ripple effect. So then in terms of inventory, obviously people holding on to the good mortgage rates they got before the Fed started raising interest rates. What is this doing for first time home buyers? What sort of options do they actually have right now? Well, if you can qualify for a mortgage, builders are discounted houses significantly. I've seen 10%, 15%, even 20% discounts to retail pricing for the entry level home buyer to come in, take a look at houses and able to close on houses. The problem is they just can't afford houses and there are too many houses on the ground. So what builders really need right now is more buyers that can qualify for mortgages. The buyers are out there, the demand's out there, but just qualifying for mortgage and then affording that higher payment is really a hurdle for the entry level home buyer. Bruce, you mentioned 10%, 15%, 20% discounts on the table right now. Can we see larger discounts if demand if traffic doesn't pick up here? Well, I think it could be a discount in the form of number of things. They can give you different features in the house, free refrigerator, ceiling fans, credit for furniture, closing costs, credits to get a mortgage and pay the points. And so I think again, it's a supply and demand thing. We were in the deep south. We were traveling through Atlanta and one builder has 150 houses on the ground finished that they have no offers on 150 houses. And that's one builder. Imagine a dozen builders. So really the builders are going to have to keep reducing their prices until the supply and demand takes care of their inventory. And then they can certainly level off those prices, but that's going to be a big hit to the bottom line of builders. But again, something's got to give. There's too many houses built, not enough buyers right now that can qualify for mortgages. Yeah, Bruce, I know that you're focused on the southeast region right now. Is this more of a regional story or is this scenario playing out across the country? No, this is a national story. There are just not enough homes for people that want homes. The millennials are now in their 30s. They're looking to start homes and their subdivisions, they're moving out of the urban core and having children. So the demand is there. The problem is, give an example, people save in 401ks right now. 401ks have become 301ks. So people certainly don't have the money, whether it's in savings, whether it's the stock market going down and retirement plans that they can borrow from. The money's just not there. The demand is there and that's across the country. Now the southeast and southwest are certainly areas that have had much higher growth and much higher demand over the years, but it's a it's a problem nationwide. And Bruce, I want to ask you about some of the layoffs that we've seen with open door with Zillow as well. What are your expectations that we know that obviously that we're far from where we were at the peak of the pandemic, when the everyone was sort of clawing for houses right now. What are your expectations for layoffs in the retail industry here? So those I buyers will certainly be cutting back if they don't have enough houses to buy and sell that certainly is going to lead to layoff.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,80,2022-11-03 19:30:42
4790," in the retail industry here. So those I buyers will certainly be cutting back. If they don't have enough houses to buy and sell, that certainly is gonna lead to layoffs and reduced income for the I buyers. But this can be a trickle-down effect. You're talking about real estate agents, all sorts of different companies are gonna be laying off people, banks, people that do mortgages, process mortgages, sell houses, real estateors. They all are gonna be squeezed by this. And I think you're gonna see a shake out across all the different industries that make up the financial positions that have to all line up for someone to afford our banks are gonna be lending less money and there's gonna be a lot of shake out in the banking industry. That's really a challenging time, all right? Bruce McNeilidge, Kimlock Partners Co-Founder, and CEO, thanks so much for joining us again here in Yahoo Finance. Sorry, we'll come up next. Pelton, chairs, they're back in the green staging. We may come back in today's session despite few signs of progress in the company's turnaround plan. We'll break it down in our triple play next.

4791," The stock had already taken a beating year to date down more than 50 percent now, as that dividend cut was expected. Plus, in recent months, Lumen closed its two asset sales and appointed a new president and CEO, Kate Johnson, who will start in those roles on Monday. Now investors are unsure if these latest move signal a turnaround story waiting to happen or a demise, as Lumen tries to get its financial house in order. A longer term, divesting non-core business to fuel sustainable growth is a plus, but inflationary pressures and high operating costs still a concern in the shorter term. You ever saw some reaction on the street, the price target cut at UBS to $7 from $11 dollars, JP Morgan also lowering their price target as a result of the earnings and what we're just getting from this company, Cowan Out though, actually taking a more optimistic tone when it comes to these latest changes. They are saying that the dividend cut here was quote long awaited and they're also saying it can turbocharge its growth initiative. So again, the stock to eat a huge hit today, but maybe it's more of a valuation call from some of these analysts at this point. All right, my play today is Peloton shares a turning positive after dropping as much as 16 percent, falling a wider than expected loss and offering weak guidance for its holiday quarter. The company also warning that a challenging macroeconomic environment could affect its goal of achieving break-even cash flow of this fiscal year despite these challenges. Comments from CEO Barry McCarthy, I think helped maybe reassure some investors out there McCarthy saying that Peloton was making quote significant progress in its turnaround plan and he's confident in the direction of this company. I think, Ross, it's interesting to see the extent of the gains that we are right now, which is about half an hour to go in the trading day, but we know that Peloton has taken a number of steps. They've made a couple of rounds of layoffs. They've reduced the price of their bike. They've also known some other strategic changes. It hasn't yet been reflected in the results, but maybe investors are saying at nine bucks a share, they're getting a little bit more positive on the name. I don't know. I think, I mean, there's definitely some value there. It's a great product, great service. Now, I think it's something another room to attach my partner so I can put the bike in there. I can't put the bike in there, but I think it's, like I said, it's value there's IP's worth something and I think we're seeing that, and I was surprised that bounce is pretty big, pretty significant. So, I guess they liked what Barry McCaffrey at McCaffrey. McCarty, and I also think we're just close as well. It's not far. I know it's hard to keep everyone's aim straight these days, but I also think it's going to be interesting because this name has been floated as a potential takeover target by a company. There's been names floated out there. It could maybe it could be an Amazon play. Maybe someone like Samsung could come in and buy Peloton, but I don't know. I don't know how this is all going to shake out because it's slowed on that we've seen in the personal fitness product space. Certainly has not turned to corner at least as of yet. You saw Google get by fit that many years ago. I always thought that the Holy Grill would be Apple buying Peloton. That would be just amazing. Thinking of all the Apple Watch, the Apple. It would be very convenient for me as a user of both products, getting them all under one roof. I agree. I'm with you on that. Maybe Tesla might buy them. Now, right now. Well, I am watching Tesla. I'm going to share the Tesla today. The China passenger cars, the station reports that Tesla delivered nearly 72,000 China-made cars on October. Now, this figure is down 14% from its record-setting September. It comes as Tesla cut prices of the Model Y and Model 3 range across the board last month. Sealing that maybe demand is falling in its second most important market. I also want to note that Rotor-Support of the Tesla closed its flagship showroom in Shanghai and moving to smaller digs nearby, which appears to be a move to cut costs and prepare for the possibility of leaner times as 2022 comes to a close to the China. A lot of people are watching and handling here what's happening in China because it's such an important market for them. Certainly, a very, very important market for Tesla. We've heard CEO Elon Musk talk about the opportunity there time and time again. The return of COVID lockdowns, if you're there, what that could do for the economy further slow down there, which maybe, I guess, part of what we're already seeing play out in the sales numbers out of China. That would be concerning for Tesla. Also, a number of multinational companies here in the U.S. just in terms of how reliant they are on China's sale. So certainly, it could be a ripple effect outside of even the auto industry at least of right now.

4793," feet miles out there. Right now, American by having all these canceled flights is actually increasing their costs and they haven't even gotten a value out of it if they had actually invested in a pilot contract. So we're going to get this done, but it's not going to be done on the cheap. It's not going to be done with a low level investment because the revenue opportunity out there is unlike anything we've ever seen. Just listen to the quarterly calls every CO saying record revenue and passenger demand like they've never seen before, even in the so called shoulder months. So then how many of these issues were already brewing before COVID really put a lot more pressure on pilots and airline workers as well versus some of the more specific things that are now coming out. So great question. These some of these issues were Fisher cracks within the foundation of operation through management's in attention to that, but the pandemic when they did not keep pilots trained, they retired airplanes early and didn't retrain pilots for that furloughed pilots had early returbs. I think I might have mentioned that bottom line was they had this wave of pilot training that they never did, which was part of the $54 billion investment promise. That part they're still catching up from. So what they've done is they saw the revenue coming in, the demand they didn't expect that to come back to 2024. Well, they were an outlier because we saw it coming along with many analysts. So what happened is now they just dumped in ticket sales, even Delta admitted they just went for the revenue and they overplayed it. So now they have a system that is not trusted, that has been pushed to the edge and the things that they did to try and keep it rolling, they continue to try and do that. They schedule us to the maximum with very little buffer and we go illegal flight cancels, where they push us to the point of exhaustion where by FAA law, we cannot fly when we're fatigued and we have to make the right call for safety and actually fatigue off of a flight. These are all undermining the reliability and the revenue stream not to mention the brand damage and it's also pushing on a margin of safety. We're going to defend that margin of safety. So no passenger has to worry about that, but we're human and the first thing that goes when you're fatigued is your judgment. It's a vicious cycle and it's got to be stopped and some of the answers are in our contract. I can guarantee you that working with us is going to be a lot less expensive than if you work against us because there's revenue to go get out there and we want to help you harvest that. With that, as she said, it's not just about the money in the latest tentative agreement. It did call for 12% raises for pilots on the date of the contract signing plus 5% after one year, 2% after two years. Were you satisfied with that part of it or do you want a bigger pay increase? Well, that did not satisfy it at all. Number one, we got it in place. What would satisfy us is actually recognizing that the entire, the regional affiliates, the smaller airplanes, they got pay raises up into the 80% range. And that's not what we're looking for. We know they're deeply behind. You can get paid more working for a regional affiliate, the smaller airplanes and you can for main line. It's upside down. We're going to fix that. The other side of this is that every contract is up for negotiations now. Sans Alaska, who settled, you're not going to be left behind. Do your management team. You're not going to be the outlier. And I got news for you. We will have snap ups because we're all negotiating in this narrow band of time. If someone gets a little bit higher pay rate, you're not going to be an outlier by providing that because we are going to have a snap up that brings us there. It's becoming the industry standard and all this the convergence of the pandemic, the recovery and these contract negotiations make it a very safe and compelling time to negotiate modern deals with pilots. It's going to be a commoditized not only on a pay rate basis, but actual utilization rate. It's all right here and it's actually going to be good for the industry. We just have to get management to join us so that we can point all of our energy toward making a better product, put more flights out there, which will actually help ease the unit cost. The more ASMG you have out there, we get this business and we want to be a part of it in a functional way, but we will not be exploited while management tries to figure out how to modernize their operation. We'll certainly be keeping track of how talks are progressing. A big thank you. I like pilots association spokesperson Captain Dennis Tager. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. All right.

That's right. You won't need two arms. Exactly. Yeah. So Pfizer by on time announcing that they're just starting the phase one to clinical trials of their vaccine, biotech leading this and sponsoring that clinical trial. They are a little bit behind in the game. Novavax has already announced positive results from a phase one to trial, but this is just adding to another COVID race. Basically, we do know that Moderna is also looking at this area with us. A candidate still in pre clinical testing and development. So they're also a little bit behind there, but that really is the new frontier. The COVID vaccine companies are able to kind of leverage what they've developed and add on to it the flu, which we know if all predictions come true and we do have to deal with this annually, that's going to be pretty useful vaccine candidate. And on Julie, I understand that quest diagnostics is out with some good news now on virus testing. What's happening there? That's right. Speaking of combo flu and COVID, a quest has also announced now that they have a test for both that patients can access at about 16,000 locations, sorry, of their patient centers. And this of course helps with the turnaround for testing both throughout the season. We know right now we're facing both of these diseases at the same time. And in the coming months, they expect that to go up. Their testing capacity for COVID has increased and we just recently talked to outgoing quest diagnostic CEO Steve Roskowski about their capacity of 300,000 tests per day capacity. So I'm sure that is going to play a role as well and how this all plays out. Indeed, and just in time for the winter months. I'm Julie Kimlani. Thank you so much. All right, coming up, Fed 4 loud. It was all going smoothly for assets until Jay Powell's comments on the terminal rate yesterday. So what's the key takeaway?

4795," Securization of XIV A major parallel to the XIVenary解決hymed treats Cholue A major精 We've been tracking the reaction to the Fed decision that didn't provide the relief that investors were hoping for with more of the play by play and how this all unfolded in the markets out of the markets. We've been tracking the reaction to the Fed decision that was going to be a little bit far there because there's a dance that evolved yesterday we had all the fireworks that was Wednesday but we got some leaks a couple weeks ago so let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive I have all this plotted out and what we're going to start with is a chart of spy that is the S&P 500 ETF and we're going back 12 days so here's the current price all the way on the right but 12 days ago in October 21st that was a week ago last Friday we got this tweet in fact it was an article two by Nick Timorossi's the Fed whisper over at the journal he said the Fed is barreling towards a fourth straight 75 basis point rate rise at the November FOMC meeting that meeting could serve as a critical staging ground for future plans including weather and how to step down to 50 basis points in December step down is a key word there because later on that morning Mary Daley well she had some confidence she's the San Francisco Fed president and she was at an event and she said in my judgment more is needed for restrictive territory that would be more rate hikes and she also said we need to watch how restrictive we cannot overtight neither this requires a step down there's that language into smaller increments of hikes hikes and the step down should be considered now but the data is not cooperating that's because inflation is too high we should think hard about step down but we're not there yet and we can see what stocks did now this is over several days and there were a lot of other factors I mean we fold in earnings into this yes but we reached a critical level in spy that corresponds to 30 excuse my excuse my drawing here 3,900 in the S&P 500 you can see price was kind of sticky there this was an ideal entry for shorts based on technical considerations and I just want to show you what happened yesterday because we did get and I'm going to put a two day view we did get a spike up on the announcement I'm going to relieve or I'm going to remove some of these annotations here we got that spike up and that was on the FOMC statement they added some key language here I'm just going to highlight and read it real quickly they don't usually change the statement that much and so changes are really in focus in determining the pace of future increases in the target range that's of their federal fund rates the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial development so in other words they're saying yeah we know that we've tightened a lot so far and that's just fine we're aware of the lag effects and markets seem to like that they thought everybody they thought Jay Powell in the fed were stepping up to a step down that would be in December now I have some comments from Al if I'm going to be interviewing him he's from the macro compass in an episode of Yahoo Finance uncut next week really excited about that but I just want to really I just want to show a few things that he said about that he's quoting Paul he's saying the income and data since our last fund excuse me incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the terminal rate of fed funds will be higher than previously expected and we will stay the course until the job is done what's far more important now is how long rates will be paying high and we will stay the course until the job is done stay the course risk management is key here if we were to over tighten we could use our tools to support the economy later on that is we could dial things back and fix it but if we failed to tighten enough inflation would become entrenched and that would be a much much bigger problem so contrary to the fed over the last and now 10 20 30 40 years since falcor guess what they're going to air on the side of tightening too much and if you want to ask",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,86,2022-11-03 19:56:57
4796," bigger problem. So contrary to the Fed over the last 10, 20, 30, 40 years, since Volcker, guess what? They're going to err on the side of tightening too much. And if you want to see what they're really talking about, if you hear Paul saying, we will keep at it over and over. This is the reason why. Keeping at it, guess what? That is the title of Paul Volcker's book. And he was a one fighting inflation way back in the day. He was. And it was really amazing just to watch the volatility that we saw play out specifically yesterday afternoon. The markets wanted to cling on to any note of optimism. But Fed Chair Powell's comments really solidify that the Fed is far from done. At least it sounds like it's going to keep at it. They're going to keep at it and they will stay the course right. Chair of like a great job breaking that down. Thanks so much. Coming up for counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. We'll be right back. Great. in the red. Yeah, who finds this is a nice phrase. A closer look at the selling we're seeing. Hey, Ness. I Shawna. Yeah, and some selling in these final minutes of trading as the Dow has turned negative. It's down half of a percent. The NASDAQ is down 1.7% and the S&P 500 down half of the sectors were watching technology that's been leading to the downside today along with communication services but you've got energy and industrials that are in the green over on the NASDAQ 100 Apple down 4% in fact Apple down for four consecutive sessions down 10% more than 10% over the last four sessions. Also looking at alphabet that that is down almost 4% trading at its end. The SEMS are also under pressure right now. Now I did mention energy stocks being in the green. We are seeing those having a lift today with XMobile of more than 1%. Here's a closing bell for today Thursday November 3rd. There you have it. The session ending for Thursday. Let's take a look at how the market negative territory the Dow",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,87,2022-11-03 20:01:35
4797," In there you have it, the session ending for Thursday. Let's take a look at how the markets pose all three major indices ending in negative territory. The Dow there, losing half a percent, down about 148 points, there's some P500, losing more than 1 percent, they're down 40 points, and the tech heavy Nasdaq taking the biggest beating, they're down 1.7 percent, they're losing 181 points. Well, let's take a closer look at the broader markets with our markets panel. Let's bring in Kevin Flanagan, wisdom tree head of fixed income strategy, and Eric Ditton, the wealth and lion's president, and managing director. Welcome to you both. So Eric, obviously, people have had a bit of time to go through and sort of pass through some of the language that we heard from Jay Powell. What do you think the markets are focusing on the most at the moment? Drill wants to be remembered as the Paul Bocher of the New Millennium and not the Arthur Burns. And so he has made it clear, he said the path, the path is shittling for the soft landing, he will sacrifice the economy if necessary to tame inflation. And that's what he's going to do. And of course, the risk is overtightening. He recognizes that. And we're frankly, he's okay with it. So if you look at it and you break it down, it's the tech that free markets, right? And just really speaking, the dad is down 10 percent year to date, and the S&P is down around 20 and the Nasdaq is down around 30. The major tech, the more growth you have in the index, the more you're getting hurt because of those rising rates. Eric, we're having a little trouble with your audio. We're going to go into try to fix that right now. But Kevin, I'm going to go to you just in terms of the action that we've seen over the last 24 hours, the selling that we're seeing led by some of those larger cap tech names, anything in this that I guess changes your view of what we could see play out between now and your rent. Well, I mean, it goes back to the prior segment, right? I think the markets were kind of grasping for any kind of sign that we would get the PAL pivot. But what we got was more or less pivot light. Yeah, we may go from 75 to 50 basis point rate hikes going forward from here, but that doesn't mean the Fed's not going to keep raising rates. And I think that was PAL's underlying message trying to get it through to the markets that were probably going to be higher for longer, and that's not something the markets wanted to hear. And Kevin, just to follow up on that, obviously we've seen this before. We've seen this 75 basis point height. We've seen it baked in markets still continuing to be enthusiastic and then very upset afterwards. And we see a lot of selling off at what point do the markets really take this on and understand the Fed is not changing course any time soon. That's a great question. I think the underlying message whether it's stocks or in my neck of the woods in the bond market, volatility is just front and center. It's not going anywhere anytime soon. So investors, I think need to be prepared to continue to see this kind of volatile action in the markets, in the indexes until the Fed probably begins to signal the actual pivot. What is the actual PAL pivot? This when they start talking about causing and maybe maybe a year from now, rate cuts, but we're a long way away from that if you listen to what the chairman saying. But I think what's important to remember is think about where we were a year ago. We were still holding on where I should say the Fed was still holding on to transitory. So we've seen how fast things can change. But I think for now, take PAL and company, at their word, it is higher for longer. Eric, we just heard Kevin, I mentioned a Fed pivot. It's going to be a while there until the Fed actually does pivot in terms of maybe the Fed scaling back more significantly or pausing their rate hikes. When do you see that, I guess, becoming a more realistic option? Well, do you believe in Fed funds futures? I don't know if we should or not. Their track record has not been that great, but nevertheless, it's kind of like the market age sentiment we have now. So let's just take it for what it's worth. June next year, June 23, Fed funds futures are showing a new range probably between five to five and a quarter. That's at least 100 basis points higher than where we are now. And I think back to that prior segment before, you know, what PAL was saying with respect to the September dots, probably have to be lifted based upon incoming data. So I wouldn't be surprised in December if instead of 4.6 percent, the terminal rate from the vendor in thermal feeding system has happened in youngest nation maps.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,88,2022-11-03 20:05:33
4798," not probably have to be lifted based upon incoming data. So I wouldn't be surprised in December. If instead of 4.6%, the terminal rate from the Fed is around five. So we have at least, if you figure they go 50 December, 25, 25, you have at least three more rate hikes coming down the pike. Eric, is that on par with what you're expecting? Yes, I think that's on par. I mean, one thing the Fed is doing is they're really telegraphing everything. They're trying not to surprise the markets. And I think the big challenge here, I mean, if you look, a lot of the Fed's medicine is working. Oil prices, gas prices have come down, lumber, steel. A lot of things are moderating. The issue really is the tight labor market. There's two job openings for everyone, employee. And we've got a demographic shift happening here. We've got baby boomers retiring. We've got people with long COVID. And we've tightened immigration policies. And the bottom line is that the workforce is shrinking. And I think that's going to be the big challenges is figuring out this tight labor market. And Eric, on top of that in your notes, you talk about the combination of the cellophane stock bonds and crypto, making this one of the worst years for wealth destruction ever. Give us some context here. Yeah, I mean, just looking at the first six months, the market had the worst six months opening since 1970. And we actually have the worst first six months in the bond market in history. And the Wall Street Journal professed just recently that the 6040 allocation has had its worst year annualized in 100 years. When you add on the crypto, and if you want to start talking about the speculation in meme stocks and in SPACs, there has been real damage out there. We were also anecdotally seeing that individuals are trading a lot of short options, options that are on the day of expiration. That is a crapshoot as bad as they come. We're seeing single stock ETFs, super high octane. This all points to the huge amount of speculation. That's the whole mark of the tops of markets. And people are losing a lot of money right now. And big tech equals big wreck. The leaders are getting shot right now. They're getting taken out. And quite frankly, the bear market can't end until the leaders come down and they are. Kevin, where are you seeing the most opportunity in the market today given the losses that Eric was just talking about and the uncertainty over the next couple of months? Well, great question. So back, like I said to my neka that was in the bond market, I think what's interesting is that perhaps the worst record of performance that we've seen in the bond market this year isn't setting the stage for a rebound or a good year in 2023 or 2024. That may be where we're going. And I think that's an important aspect to this. If you look at Treasury yields across the curve, you keep seeing highest since 2007. Think about that. That's a generation that's 15 years ago. There's a lot of investors and advisors that have never really seen interest rates at these levels. So income has come back into fixed income. And I think it's going to be interesting that, arguably, as Eric was saying, if the Fed is making this policy mistake, the economy rolls over eventually. And we do begin to see a pause, and then, of course, rate cuts coming down the pike. You are setting the stage for what could be maybe the second half of next year. And as I said, 2024, a good year for the bond market. But still, as of now, what we would say is I'd rather be late than early to the duration. Kevin Flanagan, Eric Ditton, so great to get your perspective on the recent action that we've been seeing play out in the markets. And how big does it make sense of everything that's going on next semester joining us? All right. We have an earnings alert now.

We're shall certainly a beat here on both the top and the bottom line of revenue coming in at 8.4 billion compared to Wall Street's estimates of 8.3 billion adjusted earnings per share. Same story there coming in at 81 cents versus the expected 72 cents. US seems sour sales seeing a pop there up 11 percent international sales still down but higher than what Wall Street expected if you take closer look there down 5 percent compared to the expected down 8.2 3 percent China of course Wall Street keeping a close eye there as COVID-19 policies just begin to lift there we're seeing a decline of 16 percent compared to what Wall Street expected down 21.7 percent but the big story here customers still heading to Starbucks despite those inflationary pressures over the past 15 months the company has raised prices and was consumers on mainstream continue to push through of course Starbucks here leading to the fact that they have enhanced sore partner wages increase in new partner spending and then also in addition to that they said that the plastic strategic pricing there of course will continue to keep close eye on this as CEO locksman nor is him Han takes the role of the hell rather of CEO come April 1st 2023 of course now incoming CEO Howard Schultz did oh sorry interim CEO Howard Schultz still in place there and he continues to remain confident that this pricing that they're passing on to consumers will continue into the new year as something that consumers are simply passing through indeed thank you for that update that beat on the top bottom line they're stock being awarded there to 2.04 percent Brook to Power thank you so much all right coming up we continue our coverage of Starbucks earnings plus results from Warner Brothers Discovery we've got the for you after the break,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,90,2022-11-03 20:14:11
4800, Breathe V keywords. Dancing Potental Easy Experience Tenemos Riding contemplating reporting third quarter earnings Ali Canal has a number here for us Ali what do you see? Hi when I'm seeing is this loss of 2.7 billion dollars that is the loss of the company reported for the quarter revenue missed expectations 9.82 billion versus 10.37 billion also a wider adjusted loss per share of 95 cents. Director consumer subscribers also missing expectations 2.8 million versus around 3.3 million and that's despite the success of house of the dragon we know that there's been increased restructuring charges at the company macro economic challenges like foreign exchange further subscriber losses in linear television and a slowdown in advertising that's pressured profits for the quarter the company's debt load did fall slightly compared to the second quarter from 53 billion to 50.4 billion while advertising revenue decreased to 2 billion versus 2.7 billion in the second quarter now the stock is trading relatively flat it's up slightly in after hours trading the company did reiterate it's 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance of between 9 billion and 9.5 billion they had previously lowered that so perhaps that the fact that they're not lowering that adjusted EBITDA guidance again it's giving investors a little bit of confidence in this company but Warner Brothers discoveries just one of those media giants that has really been struggling we heard from Wells Fargo Steve K. Hall he described this company as one of the best assets in media coupled with one the worst balance sheets in media so you know we'll see what the company has to say on the earnings call I expect potentially more layoffs are reported 1000 plus positions have been eliminated so far so we'll have to see how investors continue to react to this. Right again the stock though holding onto gains despite those weaker than expected results that we did get at least on the top end bottom line and I'm going to clarify the the the miss was a 2.3 billion dollar loss not I think I said 2.7 2.3 billion loss 2.3 billion dollar loss there for Warner Brothers discovery revenue of 9.8 billion missing at the streets estimates Michelle. All right well shares of Starbucks trading higher after putting those fourth quarter earnings there up almost 3% where Bush securities managing director Nick Setchon joins us to help break those numbers down good to have you back Nick now we know you had a neutral rating on the stock and a price target of $92 what did you like in his earnings report. Well the US comp is you know clearly on fire here including positive transactions so you know the company they will pass on 10% you know average check growth and still managed to get 1% positive transactions that that that's clearly bucking the trend here in the restaurant industry and then on top of that you know despite the China was the rest of international X China is doing better as well so so the rest of the markets like Japan South Korea are actually carrying China along right I mean so the consensus estimate for international including China was down 8 came in down around 6 so a beat on international as well despite China headache. Yeah Nick that's interesting here because clearly the results are very strong once you take out the weakness that we are seeing out of China but as we enter the next couple of months which at least from now looks like it's going to be pretty choppy we could see more of a significant slowdown here in the US where Starbucks clearly out performed last quarter what you read on what we could see this current quarter and looking ahead into next year. Well so I mean I expect the guidance to be very positive relative to expectations the question is you know despite the guidance what actual results will look like as the year progresses in the near term at least through the you know first half of of their fiscal year so the holiday season and then fiscal you know Q1 ending in March.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,91,2022-11-03 20:18:33
4801," In the near term, at least through the first half of their fiscal year, so the holiday season and on fiscal Q1 ending in March, or calendar Q1 ending in March, I expect them to continue to have high signature comps in the US, even with negative transactions. So I see very little risk to current expectations around FY23. And Nick, a lot of people looking for some cues as to how the consumer is feeling about things doesn't seem to be the case though, for Starbucks, even same store sales growth, up 11% people also spending more higher foot traffic. Then what do you think consumers are driven to Starbucks, whereas we're seeing some other retailers really struggling? Well, you know, interesting thing is restaurants across the board have been doing very well this quarter, not a single restaurant, with the exception of a couple of, you know, company-specific cases has missed so far, with about 85% of restaurants reporting. So every single restaurant, practically every single restaurant has beaten expectations, and has given very solid guidance, especially around the top line. And that's being driven number one by by extraordinary price increases, but even with those big price increases, the gap versus grocery is expanding. So grocery prices are seeing higher year-over growth rates than the restaurants number one. So that's helping restaurants become a relative value as ironic as that sounds. And then two, we're still benefiting, restaurants are still benefiting from this. You know, I don't want to stay home. I want to go out and enjoy experiences as opposed to, you know, ordering goods online. And so restaurants continue to benefit from that tail as well. Nick, what about the price increases over the last 12 months? We've seen prices rise by about 5%, do you think more in store? I think more in store. But I do think that because grocery starts, grocery prices are rising faster. Rough restaurants are not in danger as much as, you know, first blush might indicate. All right, always good to have you on next set in there. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Thanks. Well, earnings for eight continues. Good to have you. The earnings for eight continues with shares of Coinbase. They're trading lower after the company releases the quarter earnings report. We have your finances, David Hollerith, joining us now to break down those numbers. Hey, David. Hey, Rachelle, it's not looking too great. You know, we sort of have a forward, we're able to look in advance on this because we can see how global crypto trading volumes have done since Coinbase gets most of its revenue that way. And so it was expectedly bad. And we're seeing a revenue, a top line revenue of about 590 million versus expectations for 649 million. So at Miss revenue, it also missed bottom line, which is adjusted earnings for share was a minus $2.43 cents versus expectations for $2.12. So, and adjusted EBITDA, which is sort of, you know, a quick way to gauge how much cash Coinbase is burning came in actually lighter. So they are working on their adjusted EBITDA. They set sort of a $500 billion loss on adjusted EBITDA for the end of 2022 as sort of a guard rail for the company. More recently, as of yesterday, the head of product from Coinbase is left and the company is making significant restructuring around that area. So while cryptocurrency companies do definitely talk about building in the bear market, Coinbase grew so much in 2021. And now this looks like they're in the phases of, you know, trying to get in shape as bear market. So that's what we have so far. All right. Thank you for that update. Coinbase trading is slightly lower as we mentioned their dayfeller. Thank you so much. All right, coming up. Warner Brothers Discovery shares edging lower on earnings.

4802," Go visit PCC upon join the gallery carpet and press like button chi We're gonna brothers discovery reporting third quarter earnings results. You can see the stock now off just around 2% revenue coming in a bit light at 9.8 billion. The street was looking for 10.3 billion. Also subscriber ads, slightly missing expectations of the company adding 2.8 million subscribers during the quarter for more on this. We want to bring in parent analytics director of strategy and Yahoo Finance is Ali Kanau, excuse me sorry Julia Alexander, skipped over your name there Julia, it's great to have you. I guess just first your reaction to the numbers that we did get because we're seeing the stock off just around 2% initially actually moved higher on the news. We're all trying to scratch our heads. So what's your initial takeaway from this? I think the fact that the guidance, not the guys per se but looking at the projected EBITDA kind of being in line with where we'd hope that it would be is kind of giving us a little bit of a lift that we needed. Because if we look at Warner Brothers discovery, it's a three-pronged company dealing with three different issues right there is a theatrical business that is dealing with a slow down return to theatrical and we're considering 2022 compared to 2019. We look at the cable business there is a decline in the linear base and there is a potential decline in the ad spend as we had in 2023. And especially of course if we look at the DTC side of things where the operation cost for the revenue side of that is really going to be an ongoing conversation over the next few years. But I think a big part of what we see when we look at these earnings specifically is that 3.5 billion targeted for synergies. That means that we're going to see a lot more cuts coming both to the programming side and the labor side. We're talking about a company that's already dealt with a billion cut in programming that's cut about a thousand jobs if not more. And so I think the fact that the company is trying to approach even more in synergy is while deeply unfortunate story across the board for both programming and labor is the type of news that the street is looking for for a company that's trying to really raise",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,93,2022-11-03 20:27:27
4803," company is trying to approach even more in synergy is while deeply unfortunate story across the board for both programming and labor is the type of news of the street is looking for for a company that's trying to really rain in all of their spending in those expenses and that 50 I think 50 billion dollar that that's kind of sitting over their head. Julia, you just listed several risks for this company, both macro economic risks and then business specific risks as well. What do you think is the biggest challenge that Warner Brothers discovery needs to tackle right now in this moment. So that they don't lose those investors that they can really get on top of these problems as quickly as possible. It's a company that is trying to it's a legacy company of yes fear that is trying to be a future company of tomorrow right and so what does that mean. One they have to get those those operation costs under control and bring up the revenue in the profit side of DTC. They need to prove that this is a type of product that people are going to jump ship for that including that declining linear base. What they want to do is kind of bring that declining linear base over to the DTC product and prove that there is a profit to grow over the next several years. Whether or not that's going to happen is the question on top of everyone's mind. And especially as we're heading into a period of increased inflation we were already there but a potential bigger session kind of hanging over our heads. You know whether people want to pay for something like HBO Max when they're cheaper you know ad tier supply ad tiers over at Netflix now is a big question. So if we look at HBO Max one of the advantages that it has is according to our data the demand for the films looking at films across all major S FODs. It's actually the largest it's it's close to 20% of all demand for film sits on HBO Max but demand for the platform itself is actually decrease in the last quarter meaning that people are trying to find their entry team in elsewhere and if that demand continues to fall away from HBO Max even with it shows like House of the Dragon. It really puts a curve on how how much that platform can grow and if you're trying to tell your investors that we understand the the gross carpet market profit margins on linear are much stronger there on streaming but we really believe this is our future you have to be able to convince them that there's this is a product that's going to grow and go the next several years and right now that is something that I think a lot of their investors and shareholders are not sure about. And you Lou, we know the ad revenue story has been hanging over a lot of these streaming companies just how much exposure does Warner Brothers have to this how much is this damaging some of their some of their Q3 earnings. I mean Warner Brothers Discovery's a cable company first and foremost their businesses ads you know I like to say that television is advertising and advertising is television and although streaming seemed to curb that for a while because it was operating from a place of total monopolization under one company. There's now this factor of well every company is trying to grow their stream service and surpass that ceiling of maybe 900 million subscribers in the United States and Canada regions where the vast majority of their profits are coming from in terms of when we look at that ever driven for user. So strongest in the United States and Canada when we look at Discovery Plus and HBO Max and all the other DTC platforms alongside cable and linear that discovery really relies on to make up the bulk of its business. It's the most volatile because we look at Disney Disney has a parks business it has a it has a cruise business that other businesses that I can take in from if we look at something like you know a Google that has a YouTube right YouTube and add business but there's a bunch of other businesses coming in from Google that even when advertising on YouTube is hit there's advertisements on search and there's other places that go from if we look at again a con cast right they saw huge decline in their linear customer base but they have other means of including Robin in all the less declining it's still a very sound business if we look at Warner Brothers Discovery it is simply a cable and entertainment business and so the advertising really declines that affects them more than some of their other competitors. Julia real quickly here and we think about media mergers obviously Warner Brothers Discovery was one of the biggest from this year who do you think could be next and is this going to be the norm moving forward especially amid this competitive landscape. I think Sherry Redstone would like to offload Paramount as a whole as fast as possible I think that happens in the next couple of years but I really do think you know the NBC universal Warner Brothers Discovery although both sides of the equation continuously say that they don't see that happening that really does make a ton of sense and what we're looking at from the consolidation side as you can't just scale to scale that's not going to create a great product when order to compete with some of the apples and the designs or the world you really do need to have a skill will product that appeals to different teasplusters and different audio demographics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,94,2022-11-03 20:31:21

Discovery and NBC Universal content as well as that audience overlap and widespread opportunity. That seems like a pretty sound decision if that were to happen. Parah Analytics Director Strategy. Julia Alexander. Thanks so much for joining us to break down these results. And of course, thanks to our Alicanael as well. Coming up next, a blocking the payout Albert Sins is being sued by various estate AGs over a dividend payment linked to its program merger. Find out why and what that fallout could potentially look like next. 3-State attorneys have joined Washington State's AG and suing Albert Sins to block the grocery chain paying a special dividend of $4 billion. This is a merger with rival Kroger still faces regulatory approval. Joining us now to help us make sense of all this is Yahoo finances, Alexis Keenan. Hey, Alexis. Hi, Shana. Yeah, so these state regulators really not liking what they're hearing from Albert Sins in the supermarkets announcement to plan to sell its company to its rival Kroger. The deal was announced on October 14th and it's worth $24.6 billion. And if that's approved, that would join two of the U.S.'s largest supermarkets. But what's really rattling feathers here is Albert Sins plan to pay its shareholders this special cash dividend. It's supposed to pay that dividend on November 7th and that is well before the approvals that would come from the Justice Department and the FTC to say this merger is okay to go forward. Now the cost of this payout, Albert Sins says, is about $4 billion. It could reach por Tax fingerprints when it's on sale with our advantage. I'm starting to try to work on that Linux $1 million.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,95,2022-11-03 20:36:19
4805," become from the Justice Department and the FTC to say this merger is okay to go forward. Now, the cost of this payout, Albert, since it's about $4 billion, and that is what led the state attorneys general to ask for this payment to be delayed. But the company denied that. They said that the state AGs have no legal basis for asking for this delay. The states are arguing that the payment really will leave the company under capitalized at a time when it's really uncertain whether the deal will get that final approval. So on Tuesday, we had the Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, he filed a lawsuit and then followed by that was a Wednesday lawsuit from the attorneys general for the DC Illinois as well as California. And they're asking a federal court to step into intervene and issue a restraining order so that payment cannot be made. They point out to that that $4 billion is roughly equal to all of the company's liquid assets. The company has a market cap of $11.1 billion. Also, in a statement, Albert Sins called the lawsuits merit list. They said that these AGs just really don't have the legal foundation to go forward. Shawna, we will continue to watch. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much. All right, well, Ukraine is receiving more Western technology support as Russia's invasion of the country continues. Today, Microsoft said it will extend its technology support free of charge to Ukraine throughout the end of 2023. The finance is editor-in-chief Andy Sauer, spoke with Microsoft President Brad Smith to discuss how the tech giant plans to help Ukraine's digital infrastructure during these difficult times. Take a listen. You just pledged $100 million in technology support to the country of Ukraine here at Web Summit. Tell us about that. Well, we committed $100 million in additional technology aid to take Ukraine through all of 2023. Throughout this year, part of what is sustained Ukraine is moving their digital infrastructure into the Microsoft Cloud, into our data centers across Europe. We've been doing that free of charge. This will ensure that Ukraine, not just the government, but critical infrastructure and other services, can continue to be resilient, can continue to serve the people of Ukraine. You're also here to talk about climate and fighting climate change from perspective of Microsoft as well as sort of more broadly speaking and going on to Shawna. I'll shake after that. What are your priorities here, Brad? Well, I think when it comes to climate, one of the things we've recognized is that digital technology data AI are really a foundational enabler for all of the innovation that is needed. The energy transition, the other climate changes that are needed, even the work of the 3900 companies around the world in every part of the economy that have made a climate pledge. So part of what we're doing is advancing the use of that technology. We have our cloud for sustainability that companies are using to record and reduce their emissions. We have other technologies that startups are putting to work. And we're also looking beyond the technology itself. We're taking steps to put our house in order and we're really working to advance sustainability skills. One of the things we've recognized is like the digital era, we're now entering a sustainability revolution that is going to require that people acquire new skills relating to climate technology, climate science. And so we're working to support that as well, including through LinkedIn, which is part of Microsoft. Let's talk about Microsoft's business a little bit. Obviously the stock is down, big tech stocks are all down. How much does that have to do with valuation? How much does that have to do with the underlying business? Your earnings report was pretty solid. Some concerns about cloud growth. Where do things stand? Well, I think we've entered a lot of macroeconomic headwinds. Everybody's earnings reports have made that clear. At the same time that we're going through a cyclical change in terms of a recessionary period of time, we look at longer term secular changes. This is a decade where AI is going to accelerate. I think we'll see quantum computing come online. We're really going to see the integration of cloud infrastructure, more use of data, more use of AI, more advanced forms of computing. And I think part of what is important in a time like this is both to manage a business if needed to go through a recession.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,96,2022-11-03 20:40:04
4806," Vance forms of computing. And I think part of what is important in a time like this is both to manage a business if needed to go through a recession and enter it, but perhaps even more important. Stay focused on what will it take, what it will take to exit the recession. And we're focused on that as well. And it's clear that that will involve some big technology bets, and we're continuing to stand behind them. You're obviously here representing Microsoft, but in a sense, big tech here in Europe, how are relations between the European regulators and big tech companies sort of writ large right now? And at a better point than they were maybe few years ago? I think regulation is moving forward. That's undeniable. I think there are more conversations taking place between tech companies and regulators. I don't think it's uniform. I think that some of us are trying to adapt. Others are still resisting or fighting. One of the points that we make in Europe is that the digital infrastructure that we create is really designed to deliver more profit to a country than anything that we're going to make in that country. It's really this factor of production. It's what every country needs, every company needs to continue to innovate and remain at the forefront of competition. So that's part of our conversation. And last question, you mentioned LinkedIn. There's another social media platform out there. Twitter, Elon Musk just bought it. How successful do you think Elon will be in fixing Twitter, if you will? Well, Elon Musk is undeniably one of the greatest technology visionaries of our generation. Twitter has been a great partner for Microsoft, not just as a business partner, but in the societal space. Just a month ago, at the UN General Assembly Meeting, Microsoft and Twitter came together with the US government and the New Zealand government to talk about how we could work together to keep children safe online. How we could address the risks of violent extremism. And I very much hope and believe we'll have the opportunity to keep working, working not just as a business, but to address issues around society. At the end of the day, if you looked at LinkedIn, I think at LinkedIn, we really strive to use it as a platform that I'll say, creates more light than heat. And in the world today, there's a lot of heat, not just in the climate of the planet, but in the climate of discourse. And I think we should all strive to ensure there's a little more light and let's see if we can't advance civil discourse along the way. Thanks to Microsoft President Brad Smith and Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Sauer at the Web Summit. All right, coming up, the metaverse is one of the most buzzworthy words in tech these days. We'll find out which companies are doing it right and roll when we come back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,97,2022-11-03 20:44:43
4807," Two What even is the metaverse? Well companies like Meta, Roblox and even Microsoft have invested billions of dollars into this concept that no one knows when will ever come into fruition. We have young finances, Ali Golfingle with us now and she's put to an expert all about this. Ali. Hi, our shelves great to see you. So I sat down with Kathy Happel, Chief Metaverse Officer for Journey. She's been dubbed the Godmother of the Metaverse and the first thing I asked her was to define the metaverse. Let's just define our terms and her answer surprised me. Here's what she had to say. I don't seek to define it. I seek to build it. I think that you know we're spending a lot of time trying to define it, but if someone wants a textbook definition, they have to wrap their heads around the idea that this is the next iteration of today's mobile internet. So the successor state of today's mobile internet is about virtual shared experiences that happen both in virtual spaces, but will also happen in the physical world. That part just hasn't been fully enabled. It is a further convergence of her physical and virtual lives and it's kind of the concept or an idea of the internet being more immersive, more 3D kind of all around us, being more social, more persistent. So I felt a little bit free by that flexibility, Rachelle. It definitely surprised me because I've encountered a lot of very technical definitions for the metaverse. She even said that she isn't sure we're going to call it the metaverse in 10 years. Like the corollary I thought of Rachelle was the worldwide web. When was the last time you called the internet the worldwide web, right? That's true. I mean, I guess that'll be a tough break for meta then since they change their whole name because of it. But then a lot of people are wondering then what will the metaverse actually look like? We sort of get some sneak peeks from some companies like the Sail Roadlocks. Kathy's answer also surprised me here, Rachelle. It's not going to just be about products. It's not going to be about the Quest Pro or avatars that have that are made of legless torsos. Here's how Kathy described it. I've seen so many articles are like I spent 24 hours in the metaverse and like they were in a headset going into work like Horizon or VR chat. And that's great, but that's not the metaverse per se. Those are like lowercase metaverse platforms. That's what I call them. So right now accessing the metaverse starts through gaming, being 100% honest, through gaming, through augmented reality. So yeah, this is the thing. In my mind, we also always think of the metaverse as a place we go to. We have to go there or spend time there. But eventually, you know, it's just going to be the internet all around us, right? So it's going to be stuff that we do every day. You know, the reality here is two things that are very important is we're moving away from potentially replacing our phones into potentially some type of wearable like your glasses, you know, potentially with data being you're seeing that data. So it'll be all around us. It won't be like a place that we go to. We won't have to necessarily sit in front of our computers in front of rectangles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,98,2022-11-03 20:48:50
4808," So it'll be all around us. It won't be like a place that we go to. We won't have to necessarily sit in front of our computers in front of rectangles. So we're sure that, you know, right now it's gaming and say are and the analogy I thought of, you know, again, web too. Do I live in my Google Chrome browser? Maybe in some ways, but certainly not in others. I mean, you have to wonder if Snap was ahead of the game with the Snap glasses that sort of came in wet. If they don't really hold on for another decade, Ali Goffi, cool. Thank you so much for that update. Great stuff. So, all right, Michelle. Let's take a look at a couple of these trending after hours, checkers. We have DoorDash, Twilio, PayPal, Block, and Carvano. Let's kick it off with DoorDash again. I'm just around 15 and a half percent after our very strong results from the company revenue up 33% on year-over-year basis orders up 27% from year-go to 439 million fourth-quarter guidance, also beating the streets expectations. We're seeing that reflected in the gains after hours over the past three months of the stock still off just around 40%. On the flood side, Twilio is thinking just around 16% after hours despite the fact that they reported a narrower than expected loss and revenue beat the streets expectations. It's all about fourth-quarter guidance. That trailed estimates here. We're seeing that reflected in the stock after hours over the past three months. It's off just around 33%. The CEO will be joining the show tomorrow. So we'll be asking him about these results. Let's take a look at PayPal. Out of just around 8% after hours, net revenue, topping, expectations, adjusted EPS also coming in better than expected. Total payment volume, though, missing by just a bit. Another big headline in this report, the company will be working with Apple to enhance its offerings for PayPal and Venmo. Over the past three months, PayPal's stock is off just around 21%. Let's take a look at Block. That's up nearly 12% after hours, EPS and revenue, both beating the streets expectations. Bitcoin revenue, totaling 1.76 billion. That was a slight miss of 1.8 billion, but pretty much in line. Gross profit of 1.57 billion. That was better than what the street was looking for and we were looking gains of just around 12% over the past three months, so Block Off, just about 39%. And wrapping up with Carbana, the stock off just around a 7% after hours, tumbling on a revenue miss, 3.39 billion. Estimate was for 3.7 billion use vehicle sales. Just to over 100 in 2000, the street was looking for 114,000 so light sales there. That's being reflected in the stock after hours over the past three months. It's off about 58% year to date. That stock off, look at that, 93%. Michelle. All right, well, my stock to watch the Thursday is Hershey. Now, the candy giant was recording earnings ahead of the open tomorrow and for food companies, it's been a strong third quarter. Now, revenue is expected to rise more than 10% from a year ago while earnings are expected to decline slightly. And something you may not know, Hershey is one of the top performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year. It's actually up 20%. Now, one of the keys to her strength as of late, focusing on the US business and expanding beyond candy. Some of its other brands include Skinny Pop Popcorn, one of my favorites, and of course, Pirates Beauty. Well, stick with us, coffee lovers rejoice. Those holiday drinks are now available at Starbucks and Dunkin' and we'll sample some of what they have to offer after the break.

4809," then Out of the power ball and the size of the price for Saturday's draw has risen to $1.5 billion. A third largest jackpot in US history. If you manage to beat the odds of around $292 million to win, you'll still have inflation to deal with. Strategy is key. Winning payments can be given as an annuity in 30 installments or in one lump sum. Most pick the lump sum because YOLO, but financial advisors say in this environment, it might not be the best option. It's worth remembering the cash value prices actually the amount of money needed in the jackpot to fund the annuity. As the fed raises rates, bigger jackpots can be paid for with smaller cash on hand. If you take the money as a lump sum, inflation and tax will take a big portion of it. But at least you get it all at once. You might not live another 30 years. Hopefully you all do, but just in case you don't. You want to enjoy it while you're here, right? I hope you do. I hope everyone watching lives another 30 years. It is interesting when you start factoring in inflation into this and what this could mean. Just in terms of whether or not you are going to take that lump sum or if you're going to go with that annuity option. No winner has chosen the annuity option since 2014. So yes, we're in a very different economic environment, but it's been quite some time since someone has shown, I guess, some of the restraint and chosen that annuity option. Either way, you're getting millions and millions of dollars, whether it's a lump sum or over the next 30 years. So not a bad option, either way. All right, the holidays is officially here. At least at Starbucks and Dunk and the two coffee chains are back with their holiday menu line of Sprook-Depamma is here with the details and some treats. Sprook-Depamma, I'm this coffee that we have, but what can you tell us about? What we could expect this year. Right. Well, funny enough, you, me, Rachelle, all of us, we all have cold brews or ice lattes right now. And that just goes to show the larger trend that is the cold beverage. About two-thirds of Starbucks sales are actually cold beverage right now here in the U.S. Right here on set though, we have Dunkin'. We have the new cookie butter cold brew. Now this looks pretty intense here. It has sweet brown sugar. It's sweet brown sugar. It's big cookie flavors. It's cold brew with nodes of the sweet brown sugar, but Rachelle, I know that you have one of my favorite drinks in sort of my life. It's good, actually. You have the iced sugar latte over there. I do. So this is the iced sugar cookie almond milk latte, which is good because anytime I get something, I always do pick the almond milk option. I've been very good and haven't tried it so far, so I'm going to take a little sip. Let's go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to57nRJu1OY,100,2022-11-03 20:57:41

I've been very good and haven't tried it so far so I'm going to take a little sip as you guys take a sit to it. Let me know what you think of your holiday drink. So this is way to sugary for me, Brooke. I think from your reaction. I think you like me. You're a little startled. I think when you thought it is good though. I see why people get them and it does kind of get you in the holiday spirit. It tastes like the holidays if that's a two. I have to say anecdotally this morning at Starbucks. There was Christmas music playing. Well, there was there was Santa has no time on all the the partners there which they call their employees. But truly this just like really speaks to not only the beginning of the holidays and at least for myself, but also for so many customers out there and it also translates into sales. We saw the pumpkin spice latte sales certainly spike at the end of August. So it seems like these companies Starbucks Duncan always one step ahead when it comes to getting out those holidays. And one more reason for people to come into the stores. Richelle, real quick, what did you think of your drink? I love this. This isn't too sweet. This is this is just right. I like it. It's made me feel more festive. All right, I gotta go for that one next time. Brooke, as always, thanks so much for breaking down what we could get this holiday season at Starbucks and Duncan. We'll have to do a press today on Yahoo Finance. I'd be sure to come back tomorrow afternoon 3 p.m. Eastern time. We'll see you then.

4813," or in tune to draft kings here. That's a simple DK NG in tune to it because of the sports fandom here. You're seeing those shares down by about 16 and a half percent after posting a loss of dollar per share for the quarter. And despite topping revenue estimates that's working in the company, saw net interest expense losses grow heavily from last year for draft kings. This is a good time to be a sports fan in Philadelphia, but also who's looking across the number of different sports that there are more opportunities to bet on. And it's a larger question of where draft kings may be able to move forward even with their partnerships, ESPN and draft kings. That was a huge conversation at least in terms of the reports that were emerging that they may be looking for a tie up somewhere. And that would be, I think, incrementally incredible opportunity for them to tap into, especially with the amount of broadcasting that they would have access into there. Yeah, a little bit surprised by the market reaction. This was a pretty good quarter. User metrics look strong. They also paired their loss expectations for the year, but maybe it's just the market wanting some signal of when this company might turn profits. Maybe so. I don't know. Like I said, a lot of them are paying attention to EBITDA numbers as well, and that's sort of not... I don't know. I don't know what's going on with draft kings either. Well, it's such a massive cost for them to take on customers. The customer acquisition costs and the marketing expenses that are company in draft kings or any of the different sports books that have a mobile first approach. They've got to spend a ton of money just to get people on the platform and then retain the 1.6 million average monthly, unique paying BTC customers as draft king classifies them. That was an increase of 22%, but the expenses on the other side too, just to get new customers that continue to come in and offer them money to bet on the platform first out, that they have to put out there on the table as well. This was what I was fumbling around trying to find. I was saying that a lot of investors are focusing on the EBITDA on the cash flow number for these companies, and that forecast is bad. That's what I was fumbling around to say. The company says, for 2023, it's adjusted EBITDA loss will be $475 to $575 million. Analysts have been looking for a loss of $426 million. So even on that adjusted EBITDA basis, the company is looking for wider losses than have been forecast. So that is the problem here that they're maybe not pushing at least in the vague direction of profitability as quickly as the street wants to. So draft king's fumbling before football Sunday. There you go. There you go. You're at the headline. I know we got to go to break, but one other number that could be an interesting kind of consumer budget tightening indicator from draft king's moving forward is this average revenue per user, per monthly, unique pay, or at least $100 in the third quarter. And that is an increase year over year, 114%. But if you eventually see that start to turn down, that could mean that some of the users are tightening how much they're willing to gamble and put out there in the sports betting market. And what's the cost of acquiring that customer? I'm betting both of you getting yelled at right now in the selection. Yeah, we probably are right now. Yeah, coming up. We're going to stop getting yelled at. Coming up on the other side, the short break. Yahoo, fine, this is Jared Blickery. Gonna break down the latest market action on the back of the October jobs report. That's next, sorry, I'm against it. Music",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,1,2022-11-04 13:42:02
4814," she We're taking a look at the major averages this morning on this jobs day in America that Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. They're all in positive territory all by nearly a percent on the Dow. It's up by about nine cents a percent and then fractional gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Let's get on over to the Wi-Fi Interactive Zoom in this morning to Jared Blickery. This is Rob's Day in America. I'm hearing a James Brown tune in my head living in America. Let's go to the board here. S&P 500, up about nine tenths of a percent. Let's check out the five day price action still hovering around the bottom end of the range there kind of digesting that news that we got from the Fed and Chair Powell on Wednesday. I want to take a look at a longer term view of the S&P 500. This is three months. Market is behaving very technically. This is in contrast to what we had most of the summer, even in a lot of September. I'm drawing these lines here 50 percent and that's called the halfway back of that movement right there. 3,900 huge, huge level here. We stopped there for a few days, sold off, but guess what? We hit the 50 percent retracement the halfway back of this bullish movement. Now we have retraced to the 50 percent. You get the picture here. So basically the market is coiling for a big move. We don't necessarily know where that is going to go next, but I do want to show you what has been happening in the bond market. Here's a five year Tino yield hovering near decade-old highs. It's down just marginally here. 10 year Tino yield up about two basis points. So not too much movement in reaction to the payrolls report. Then we have the US dollar index. That had been a little bit stronger early after the report, but now it is shifting down strongly. So that's kind of sending the opposite reaction that we might have expected. And I just want to point out that, remember a few weeks back CPI came out. It was expected to be a very bearish reaction in the market because it was a bearish print. But guess what? We rallied that day. If it's the same thing going on, we might expect something kind of a bullish reversal in the future. Let's talk about China stocks for a minute, Jared, because there are still some reports percolating about what a wind down of the zero COVID policy or softening of it would look like. It would look like this writ large because you're seeing a lot of dark green on the screen. Oli Baba, 4.5% Lee Auto, 9%. All of these stocks have been hit if not absolutely obliterated, not only in the last year, but the last two to three years. So we're seeing a lot of red here. This is a year to day look here. But nevertheless, take a look at the five day price action. We're seeing some movements, some positive development on this front. China is still a huge wild card. But I got to say in the midst of all this uncertainty, if in fact China were to give definitive inklings, not inklings, definitive motion towards a reopening, towards an end of the zero COVID policy. Guess what, guys, I think that could provide the bullish impotent for the market, for the S&P 500, you get above 3,900 and for that short covering route.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,2,2022-11-04 13:46:07
4815," I guess what guys, I think that could provide the bullish impotent for the market, for the S&P 500 you get above $3,900 and for that short covering rally, a lot of traders are expected. All right, Blickery, thanks so much. All right, Ms. Ernie's estimates and serve up we've got and set your own risk according to the spoke. There have been 20 stocks that have fallen 20% plus on their earnings report this season. Only 10 companies have gained 20% plus on their earnings reports. Coming up, we'll get more commentary on that October at Johns Report when Goldman Sacks is for pre-gill on the other side of the brick. As we've been discussing job growth remains strong in October, stoking fears around continuing inflation and more importantly continued interest rate increases because earlier this week, Jay Powell, chair of the Fed, described the labor market as overheated without any real signs of softening. Thank you for being here. Thank you. gain in non-farm payroll employment, exceeded expectations, but actually if you look on a historical basis, when you are in a tight labour market, companies tend to pull forward their hiring for the festive season, so that might explain the beat on non-farm payrolls relative to expectations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,3,2022-11-04 13:50:30
4816," a tight labour market, companies tend to pull forward their hiring for the festive seasons, that might explain the beat on non-pronged payrolls relative to expectations. And then when you looked at the uptake in the unemployment rate, that was in part due to developments on labour force participation, but that data tends to be very volatile. So I don't think it is a game changer between now and the December meeting. We have two more CPI inflation prints and another labour market report. So that is the sort of top tier data that financial markets are going to be focused on. Gryffrey, is a recession the only thing that might bring people who have been on the sidelines of labour force participation back into the workforce? Well, the issues between labour supply are varied. So there was a structural element to it, prior to the pandemic, the US had lower male labour force participation relative to other advanced economies for various reasons. As a result of the pandemic, as I'm sure you're well aware, some people are excited to the workforce for childcare reasons, addressing that requires structural reform and policy. Some people like in the UK, for example, are out with long-term sick due to COVID. Again, there's a lot of uncertainty around that. I wouldn't say that you necessarily need a recession to improve labour force participation. There are other ways to do that. But big picture in the near term, the rebalancing of the labour market that is needed to bring inflation back to inflation target consistent levels is going to require a reduction in labour demand because policy makers have sort of given up hope on the improvement in labour supply. And that's why we're very focused on what happens with job openings and what's happening in the labour market reports. Grapri, how do you think the bond market will react in front of what looks to be another series of rate hikes coming? Well, what's interesting is an analyst in my team is looking at fixed income spread markets in response to the four-fed 75 basis points rate hikes. And we've actually seen that those risk assets largely become acclimatized to this pace of rate increases and it was well-flagged. And in July, actually, you saw a rally because there were hopes of a bad policy pivot. So I think lots of lots will depend on those three P's that everybody is focused on right now, which is the prospect of a pivot and the pace of rate hikes and that peak in the policy terminal rate. We think that the bed there is increased prospect of a downshift to 50 basis points and we're going to move towards a slower pace of tightening but potentially for longer. And that's actually consistent with past developed market central bank hiking cycles. In our view, actually, the rapid repricing in bonds at the front end is largely behind us and actually we think it's a very opportunistic environment for investors to add exposure to high quality short-uration bonds lending to a high quality company or government for a short period of time is a very attractive alternative to the still very low rates that retail investors earn on bank deposits. That's interesting, Geprita. And when we look at the benchmark tenure, for example, how should we think about the relationship between the yield there and the Fed funds target rate? In other words, for example, if the terminal rate is 5% what would that imply for the tenure? Well, we're in an environment where they are both sick equal developments at play in terms of what the Fed is doing to cool the economy to address inflation. And that is impacting the US yield curve and US rates. But big picture were also contending with structural inflation forces that imply that inflation is going to be higher than the last cycle. And so I would say where rates ultimately settle is still in flux. We like the policy makers have to be very data dependent. We have to be humble in our outlook and very nimble in adjusting our views and our expectations based on what the data is telling us. But I would say we do think that we are going to be transitioning into a higher inflation environment for investors. The last cycle was all about low rates and this view of there is no alternative to riskier higher yielding assets. But now we actually think it is time to bring on bonds or bonds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,4,2022-11-04 13:54:34
4817," and this view of there is no alternative to riskier higher yielding assets. But now we actually think it is time to bring on bonds or Bob. So Tina's giving way to Bob and there are opportunities in high quality short duration assets like I mentioned. But until we reach peak policy hawkishness, we do not think it is wise to have long-awakeration exposures. Copy that. Thanks so much, Grapri, good to get your perspective on this important day. Goldman Sachs, Assets, Management, Global Fixed Income and macro strategist, Grapri Gill, thank you and we'll be right back. Let's get another check on markets here. Now we are almost 90 minutes after the jobs report and just about 30 after the opening bell this morning. It stops already giving up some of their gains that we saw out of the gate here this morning after the jobs report showed a gain of 2,000, 1,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked up a little bit to 3.7%. But we do see stocks pairing their advance. Earlier we saw major averages up more than 1%. Now the NASDAQ which I have been leading is up just about 2 thirds of 1%. Coming up, what do those October jobs numbers mean for unions? We are going to speak with the president of SEIU International and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.

I'm Brian Sasi, once I Julie Hymon and Brad Smith, U.S. economy added, 261,000 jobs in October, the unemployment rate coming in at 3.7% better than expected showing continued resilience in the U.S. labor market. And for the latest pulse on U.S. workers, we have U.S. labor secretary Marty Walsh joining us very shortly. And a tale of two fintechs, PayPal and Blocks spending different stories for investors, Alan's Mark Palmer will join us to break down the earnings parade. And later on, we'll dive into Funko, a shares crater following its latest quarterly report. First, let's get to Brad at the Wi-Fi, Interactive Brad. All right, let's take a look at the Dow Jones industrial average kick things off. At this, the top of the 10am hour on this Friday, congrats. You've made it to the end of the week here. Dow Jones is up by about 1% right now. Nasdaq composite, you're seeing that higher by a little more than 1% as well, the SCP-500. You're also seeing that hold on to gains by about 1.1%. Let's just put this in a five-day context to see how the week is rounding out. Overall, S&P 500 over the past five days still lower by about 3.5%. Nasdaq composite, that too in the red. Actually, the deepest decline of the U.S. major averages this week. And then additionally, you're seeing the Dow Jones industrial average over the past five days still lower. So, we've got solid movement at least to end out this trading week. And that's on the back of today's jobs report. Also, taking a look first at the sectors. And I'll come back to this retail and apparel segment for a hot second in a moment. But the sector activity that we're seeing here on the day, we've gotten a little more mixed. And actually, now we have more laggards than advances here. Take a look. Energy is up 3% here on the day. And actually, let's put this in an intraday view. And now we're in the correct correlation there to today's activity. We've got a total of 11 S&P 500 sectors in positive territory. And then just briefly going back to those apparel names that we've been tracking. As there's been some fresh news out of Adidas, as they've named a new CEO. Beyond Golden, going to become the CEO of Adidas. And so Adidas is up by about 14% right now. At least the shares that trade overseas are right now. So we'll continue to watch that. But moving forward here on the day, the U.S. has added 261,000 jobs in October while unionizing efforts continue to make its way through the labor market.

4819," Added 261,000 jobs in October while unionizing efforts continue to make its way through the labor market. Starbucks made one of many companies all too familiar with workers unionization efforts. Here's what's the F.O. Rachel Regieri had to say on the matter. We truly believe a side-by-side relationship with our partner is the very best path forward, but we respect the process. What we're focused on is continuing to create the very best experience for our partners. We know that that has worked for the last 50 years and we're confident it actually underpins the success of our new era of growth. So that's where we're focused. And to take a closer look at the labor movement in the U.S. and workers' rights, we have Mary Kay Henry, International President of the Service Employees International Union. Thank you so much for taking the time here with us this morning. First and foremost, just got a get your reaction to what you heard from the Starbucks CFO. Well, if that was the case, then workers would be at a bargaining table and being able to have a say directly on the job. And instead, the Starbucks is choosing to fight tooth and nail closed stores when people unionize. And we really welcomed the day when the CFO's comments are the reality with Starbucks because the partners love that company. And they want to see it at the table and a voice on the job and to be respected, protected, and paid what their worth. Mary Kay, Julie, I'm curious if you've ever had an experience where a company has said, come on in. Yes, we're happy to have union to your, let's go. I mean, is it much more than norm to have more of an adversarial relationship? Well, there's been periods in American history where employers have said, come on in. When Kaiser Permanente was founded in the 40s in California, it opened as a healthcare provider that all the jobs were union. And today they have the highest patient satisfaction and the employee satisfaction in the healthcare sector. Harley Davidson, it was a conflict with those workers, but now the United Steel workers and Harley Davidson have a very good relationship and the company's profitable. So it's true. I think what you're saying, the norm in the U.S. economy is for corporations to resist workers who want to join together. And we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that I believe are driving wages up, even though wage growth is slowing as we have this terrific jobs report this month. And I think that's why we're going to continue to see workers joining together at Starbucks, Amazon, fast food, airports, and across the service and care sector because people want to turn poverty wage jobs into good jobs that they can raise their families on. Mary Kay, what would getting it right look like for Starbucks? Are you talking $25 an hour and guaranteed 40 hours a week? Well, getting it right would be recognizing the union at the 250 stores that have already voted to join the union and allowing workers who want to file for elections. The ability to do it without their managers interfering with it or changing their schedules or moving people around stores. The continued anti-union campaign should stop. That would be a way to get it right. And then ultimately, it would be terrific if Starbucks would break with major corporations in the U.S. and do what they do in other countries around the world and set a national bargaining table where there could be a standard as you're suggesting that the workers and the corporation could figure out together. This is in a climate where corporate profits are at an all-time high, highest in 70 years. And so that's why I think the Starbucks and Amazon organizing is connected to the economic health of major corporations here in this country and around the world. And it's why things would go so much better if employers would stop resisting the union and start respecting the right of workers to decide for themselves whether they want to be in a union. Well, it's also driven by the workers shortage, right? That, you know, it's hard to find people to feel those positions. And so we've seen this period of a little bit more of the power being.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,7,2022-11-04 14:07:33
4820," on a B and a union. Well, it's also driven by the workers shortage, right? That, you know, it's hard to find people to fill those positions. And so we've seen this period of a little bit more of the power being put back in the workers' hands. But that might be about to shift again, right? If we're heading into a recession, if we are going to see the job market sort of turn around in the next year or so, could that also change the dynamics for unions? You know, I actually think what's driving workers to join together in unions is beyond the shortage and is about the two-year pandemic that people just work their way through and had the experience of their co-workers get hardest hit by the pandemic because people were showing up every day, often without the personal protective equipment they needed. And I think when people continue to work and we're facing life and death choices, I've heard this directly from nurses, retail workers, fast-food workers, they decided that when their employer started to resist them and threaten their job, it was like, okay, if you're going to threaten to fire me, after I just spent two years risking my life to show up to work, then I probably don't need this job. And that's why I'm going to join together with my co-workers and create a collective bargaining agreement so that workers can be respected on the job, protected in their health, and paid what they're worth. Mary Kay Henry, SEIU, International President, good to see you. Have a great weekend. Thank you. All right, the U.S. economy created 261,000 jobs in the month of October. Let's get more of a pulse on the jobs market with U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. Marty, always good to see you here this morning. You're taking these job numbers. I mean, certainly, the good job numbers were low unemployment. I like seeing that every month. And what was starting to see, I think, is nice as a slow-steady growth in our economy. And I think that we're not getting, certainly, the slowdown that a lot of people want to see, or alleging they need to bring the inflationary pressures down. But I think we are sat in the sea slow-steady growth that we move forward here. Do you believe that we'll see more people come back into the workforce, those who have perhaps sat on the sideline for one reason or another, whether that's childcare, or whether that's the coronavirus pandemic and workplace issues, whatever that may be, that they'll start to come back into the workforce. If we do see a deep recession, or at least a more pronounced recession. I think we'll definitely see more people go back into the workforce. I mean, there's lots of job openings in the country right now. And we were talking about that this morning, what I went out of the office and BLS, just to see where the job openings are. And when you think about job openings, the largest job openings in our country are in lower paying jobs. They're in hospitality industries. And yet, we're sat in the sea people come back into the workforce. And they have higher skills and degrees, and they're looking to get into better paying jobs. So right now, as we move forward here, we've got to make sure we're partnering jobs with people and what their ability to do is. And I think that that's something that we have to really think about moving forward. At least that's what I'm thinking about moving forward here at the Department of Labor. Marty, maybe some of those people going to be in these jobs will be laid off software engineers. I don't know, because we're hearing about, or people who are looking for job in that sector. And there's not that job anymore. We're hearing about a lot of tech companies that are either cutting or freezing hiring right now. There's just a report that Elon Musk, now that he owns Twitter, is going to cut 3,700 people there. I know that you had talked to Musk in the past regarding his build out in Texas for Tesla. Now he's cutting jobs in his other business and his newly acquired business. I'm just curious what you think about that sort of flow of jobs there. Well, certainly, one thing in this jobs report, that's not reflected yet in this. And certainly I'm keeping a close eye on that, because I dig the tech sector in the United States over the last several years, certainly has grown. And those are good paying jobs. And those are jobs that are in lots of cities like Austin, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, out in New York and Chicago, places like that. So I have to dive into that a little more. We haven't seen, I don't think a lot of life, actually, but there's been lots of talk of layoffs and freezing hiring. So certainly that's something that would concern me, because they have good paying jobs. And a lot of states and cities and places around the country have built out expansion of their cities, whether building new housing, things like that. It's for this exact sector, this tech sector. So it's something.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,8,2022-11-04 14:12:03
4821," A lot of states and cities and places around the country have built out expansion of their cities, whether building new housing, things like that. It's for this exact sector, this tech sector. So it's something that I'm interested in. I'm going to dive more into and certainly offering right now to any tech company out there, anything that we can do at the Department of Labor to help you in a situation. I'd love to do that. As far as Twitter, I mean, that's a whole different situation. I think that's, I don't know enough about it, but I think that's Elon Musk in looking at the business model. I'm sure at some point that will fix itself out as it moves forward. While we have you, we do know that there's been a move from New York City, this recent, of course, in the salary transparency that's come forward. And regardless of what started, it's gotten off to. I think there is still this broader recognition that there can be more room for salary transparency that is beneficial to both the employee and the employer. What would you like to see on that front as New York City has already rolled this out, perhaps where some other cities and states could also have that type of transparency that leads to a more healthy employer employee relationship and kind of reduces some of the parity issues in pay scale? Yeah. Well, we did that in Boston. When I was the mayor of Boston, we had 200 companies in the city that gave us the pay data. And anonymously, we were able to dissect it and really work on pay equity and making sure that women and men would pay the same. We made some really good gains in the city of Boston. It wasn't heavy handed. The companies came to the table. These are the large corporations. And I think having these conversations are really important. And coming up with policies moving forward are important. We were successful in the city of Boston. They're still, hopefully still doing it in the city of Boston. But in other places, it really is about having these conversations and not just to pay equity and transparency, but also in leadership of companies and getting women on boards and things like that. And all of those important aspects of growth and moving forward, legislation has passed often about pay equity. We shouldn't, women shouldn't need legislation to be paid the same as a man. Women should be paid the same as a man for doing the same exact work. And that's something that not just elected officials, but CEOs of companies should work on. With 2022, the time has come to make equity in the workplace consistent. Mr. Secretary, this jobs report just continues a string of really solid, to strong labor market reports, but it comes against the backdrop of slowing or declining productivity in this country. I do you think the hustle culture this country was founded on is just done? Yeah, my economy just, they went over that with me yesterday. And I was trying to get a good reason on how we measure productivity in the United States America. And I think that we're still working through that. I mean, I think the productivity America is strong. I think that when the terminology of quite quits came up or all of that happening, I never heard it in the communities. I haven't heard it when I was out there talking. I think American workers are still working strong. They're working, getting paid, but on a lot of construction sites, I've been in a lot of manufacturing facilities. Those workers aren't slowing down. Those workers are working hard. So I think that, again, I don't know enough about the data. I don't think the data is consistent or strong as it should be, to really tell the true story of American workers. All right. The US Labor Secretary, Mari Warsh, always good to see you. Have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. And we'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,9,2022-11-04 14:16:27
4822," You Now it's some other headlines that we're watching at this hour. Saudi Arabia's public investment fund or PIF says it will make electric cars in the kingdom under a joint venture with Apple supplier FoxCarn. That's part of a push to build new industries and lessen the nation's dependence on oil. FoxCarn will develop the electrical architecture of the vehicles and seer will be the name of the first Saudi automotive brand to produce electric vehicles in Saudi Arabia. The PIF said its cars would be available in 2025 and seer is projected to contribute 8 billion dollars to the kingdom's GDP by 2034. Chrysler parent Stellantis warning nearly 300,000 vehicle owners immediately to stop driving their cars after three crash deaths tied to faulty ticata airbaggin-flaters were reported in the last seven months. The do not drive warning is currently in place for owners of previously recalled 2005 to 2010 Dodge Magnum station wagon, Dodge Challenger Coops, and Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans that had not addressed that airbag issue. And Aldi is doing a Thanksgiving price rewind in an effort to draw customers to its chain amid surging inflation. The grocery retailer lowered prices for its Thanksgiving dinner food items to match 2019 prices. That means discounts of up to 30% for select items. If you recall, we reported earlier this week that Walmart announced a similar pricing strategy, but they're just rolling it back to last year's prices. That would be in about a 15% discount. So Aldi saying, no, no, no, we're going all the way back to 2019. Hold my perky. Wait a minute. Something like that. Hold the gravy, whatever. Anyway, it has been a rough year for the semiconductor sector. First companies such as AMD and Nvidia could not get enough chips to supply customers. And now slowing PC sales are hurting the industry. Shares of chip makers, they've been sliding all year and it could give worse. Sazzy is here with his take on this one. Yeah, nothing like dumping this negativity on a day when all the chip stocks are up. And nonetheless, highlighting a good note from cities, Chris Daly. Really one of my favorite chip analysts out there on Wall Street. And he's offering up some good reasons why the sell-off in chip stocks and the socks index or the Philadelphia semiconductor index might be really ripe for further another sell-off here. First, industrial end market demand is rolling over. Red flag there as well. Auto sales are in fact cooling. A lot of chips, of course, get used in various automobiles. PC and handset demand are correct. And we heard that. We have heard that within the past two weeks from the likes of an Intel and an AMD, that PC correction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,10,2022-11-04 14:20:46
4823," that used in various automobiles. PC and handset demand are correcting. We've heard that. We have heard that within the past two weeks from the likes of an Intel and an AMD. That PC correction is alive and well and it has been very ugly for a lot of players. And even too, the handset market as well has been correcting as we learned from Qualcomm's warning yesterday. And then lastly, companies are more tightly managing capital expenditures. It is full on. It continues to be budget planning season in corporate America. And we're starting to see a lot of, I would just say tighter cap X budgets for next year. Maybe that means a fewer less chips. Now of course, there you can see that affiliate, I'll see a semiconductor index on the screen right there. That has been, it has not been a good year for that, not a good year for an AMD and Nvidia, many other players in that semiconductor index. Daily things, EPS, estimates for chip stocks can tank at least another 20% from where they are now. That would be a big plunge and likely put further pressure to his point on the stocks. And that the stocks index could plunge at least 15% as those earnings estimates come down. And might take here, in search of bottom, it definitely brings up a couple good points on what would ultimately cause that bottom in chip stocks. For him, it is the end market no longer correcting, valuation just reaching levels that are truly trough and no more cap X cuts. And I'm trying to figure out why I'm in a basket. Is that what that is? I think that's a basket of trash can. It's a trash can. Wow. That's a waste. That's a waste. That's not a waste. That's all. That's all. It looks like a wicker basket, like a laundry wicker basket. Yes, so if it's a trash can. I feel like I should. I know who made it and it's a trash can. It's a trash can. Okay. Well, we'll see what happens with chips. I mean, it depends on the time horizon you look at. Because it's interesting when you talk to some investors and they say chips obviously are still going to meet them. Yes. And so if you're an investor who's looking at five years, ten years, you might have, if you have that luxury, you might have a different sort of assessment here of what this group looks like. Yeah. Look, AMD's business is still growing. Qualcomm is still growing. It's just a matter of they're not growing at the rates that they were and the growth rates have really, really, really stalled. I think that Qualcomm report was just not good on many accounts this week. Yeah. And it's a lot of things, many of which you pointed out and you're taking today's side. I was appreciated. Guys, coming up, payment platform, round up. We're going to break down the earnings from Block and Paypal with BTIG's Mark Palmer. That's coming up next. Yeah.

4824," // Ritual DistANK sucks shit out of reach Payment platforms block and PayPal. They are on the move today, but in divergent ways after PayPal cut its full year revenue forecast while blocked. So 51% pop in its cash at business year over year. D have, it is offering a bank account substitute to consumers, particularly in the lower end of the income spectrum, who really benefit from those types of services, especially to time when a lot of banks focusing on their own profitability are growing up the gates and letting less consumers to start bank accounts within their platforms. So it's got a mission critical functionality while at the same time it's seller ecosystem, which is basically allowing points of sale payments, has remained robust, which we believe is largely because the company is offering tools to small businesses and medium-sized businesses that enable them to better manage their payment needs. Mark, it's Julie here, it's good to see you, talk to me about CashApp versus Venmo because I sort of think of those in the same bucket, although I know CashApp has broader applications. Is CashApp taking share from Venmo, or is it just expanding the pie entirely and signing up different and new customers? Yeah, we believe there are very different use cases for Venmo versus CashApp. Venmo historically had more of a social element, it has more of a focus on a somewhat higher income demographic than does CashApp. So it doesn't really serve as a bank account substitute the same way that CashApp does. And one of the things that we really saw in the third quarter was block really leaning into the banking functionality associated with CashApp, and we expect that to continue making it even more relevant to the lives of the people who are using it. Mark, the last time I caught up with the PayPal team, they were pitching the story of expense reduction and a pivot in operating margins next year. I mean, do you agree with that? And if so, what does that pivot look like? Well, we agree that they're pivoting. If you look at PayPal today versus where it had been a couple of years ago, the orientation is just very different. A couple of years ago, the focus was on ubiquity. It was on customer acquisition. It was on the top line growth. And this is how PayPal became a stock that was trading at north of 60 times earnings. Flash forward to today, and we see a stock that's trading at a below market multiple, somewhere around 16 times earnings or a little bit below that. The reality is that PayPal has pivoted toward being what we believe to be more of a mature model, focusing not on customer acquisition, but on increasing penetration of existing customers, cutting costs to drive the bottom line. These things are crumpled in an uncertain...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,12,2022-11-04 14:29:18
4825," but on increasing penetration of existing customers, cutting costs to drive the bottom line, these things are crudent in an uncertain, macroeconomic environment, but they don't represent the characteristics of the growth stock that PayPal had been a couple of years ago. What kind of growth gets evaporated when you layer in an Apple Pay and any continue furthering of their own Fintech ambitions as well? Yeah, you know, it's interesting because one of the things that PayPal has done historically is rather than try to fight some of the big tech titans who were getting into payments, they've collaborated with them. You know, we saw this with their tie ups with Visa and Mastercard a few years back. You know, more recently now we're seeing PayPal collaborating with the lakes of Amazon and Apple, trying to maintain their relevance and frankly, we believe that the announcements that the company made with regard to you being able to integrate Apple's tap to pay, things of this nature are making its payment functionality more robust, but when you back up and look at the bigger picture, the question is how is this company going to be able to sustain growth? They're guiding initially to 15% earnings growth in 2023, but at the same time, they're making a lot of statements about the vulnerability of their end consumer to an uncertain macroeconomic environment, thus putting that 15% growth in a very risky position right out of the bat. Mark, you're out here this morning keeping your buy rating on Coinbase F their earnings last night, but taking your price target to $110 from 220, when will this company live up to its promise? Well, I think that's largely a function of what's going to happen in the end market. Coinbase can and is setting itself, but it can't control the wind. And the wind in this case is the crypto market, which is very much correlated with risk assets in general and as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten, the outlook there is very much uncertain. So what are we seeing? We're seeing Coinbase preserve its optionality by focusing on maintaining a large cash balance, building out its institutional crime brokerage platform, and continuing to add new functionality and areas like staking that are relevant to those in the crypto space. So I think what we are seeing now is a lot of building that's going on not only in Coinbase, but among Web 3 platforms in general, in anticipation of getting a bit more of a tailwind so that you can see the full realization of the platform's potential. BTIG, managing director, Mark Palmer, always good to see you. Have a good weekend. It's a talk to you. Coming up, what's on tap for Disney's earnings next week?

I mean, it's softening demand for pre-owned vehicles. Product supermaid joins us now. Pros not a good quarter from Carvana, but again, more pressure on the shares here. Yeah, it seems like these high rates are really hurting there. You know, most people with Binance, there's their cars, 40 million Americans buy used cars every year. Carvana, I'm gonna tell you about how this is a rate-sensitive kind of purchase. Like he said, big miss on the top and bottom line. Gross proper vehicle down a thousand bucks year over year. That's a huge kind of like decrease in your profit margin there. So, you know, they said things would get worse for them to get any better. So there's not much there for them to kind of like hopefully hang their head on soon. But, and then in the ice going to the cake is they suspended their guidance, right? So they can't kind of see what's next, given how uncertain things are. So, you know, the Carvana business model has been hurting all year, right? As we've sort of seen things kind of slow down, rates go up. And the question is, is this rock bottom and then are they going to kind of like, you know, it's a good product, right? It's a really easy thing people like buying their cars online. So it's like it's got value that the question is, can they make it a profitable venture? We also saw some news this morning that Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, their selling shares of a China-based EV maker. So can you tell us more about that? So many years ago, BYD, Berkshire bought a pretty significant stake in BYD by 20%. They've held on for about 10 years and they started selling little slivers of it. Starting this late this summer. This is the third, I believe third sale they've done. Another, I think I believe another three million shares here. They sold about a million and a half also in September. So it's still, they sold over 200 million shares. So it's still like a significant kind of holding. But the question is, is Warren ready to kind of exit this? If they made a lot of money off this stake, they bought it for 225 million, I think 10 years ago. And now it's over 10 years ago. And now it's worth 7 million, I think. So the question is, when is it time to exit? Does it see as a long-term Buffett player? Is it time to sort of like re-evaluate? Interesting. We saw those shares rallying just now along with other Chinese stocks during the session. So interesting. Thanks, boss. Appreciate it. And also looking ahead to the Walt Disney Company next week at Central Port Earnings. We see the shares up about 1.5% or so today. There is a lot going on when it comes to Disney from the parks around the world. Remember, we just had reports of Shanghai Disney being shut for a bit because of COVID there to the streaming landscape here in the US a lot to consider. And considering all of it, is our Alexander going to have things here with us unsaid? Hey, Ali, so what's the sort of big picture numbers you're going to be looking for? Well, clearly we learned a lot from Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount. When it comes to the state of the market right now, obviously the weakening ad market impacting their bottom line. I expect that to happen to Disney a little bit, but this company has a lot of levers to pull. I spoke with Tim Nolan from McWire. He reiterated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% of your to date, but you didn't know that over the long term this company has a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,14,2022-11-04 14:38:13
4827," He's tolerated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% year to date, but he did note that over the long term this company has a lot to look forward to. What you're looking on your screen now is a Wall Street projections. Revenue expected to come in at 21.27 billion, adjust the DPS of 51 cents, parks experiences and consumer products revenue at 7.59 billion, but a really important number is that operating income. 1.9 billion is expectation. That's less than what we saw in the third quarter, but we could see a little bit of an impact from Hurricane E in there, perhaps some of that Shanghai Disney closures. And then those Disney plus subscribers expected to come in at 9.35 million. Now what Nolan told me to watch is that direct to consumer subscriber figure. Like I said, 9.5 million expected, along with that add to your expectation. How will that add to the company's bottom line? Nolan estimated that add revenues could surge up to 800 million in 2023 thanks to Disney plus. That's sort of the overall market opportunity there. And then on the park side, you wanna make sure that gross bookings aren't going down that there's no recessionary impact. The analyst pointed out that in 2009, the last financial crisis, park revenue fell 7%. But there's a bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases, to prices, updates to the park, the Genie Plus app, et cetera. And then finally, the impact of that advertising slowdown. ESPN I think is pretty insulated from all of that. But ESPN and other big question, right? Looking forward to the company. What's the DTC future of this? Because right now it's clearly more profitable in a linear world than it is in an OTT world. But something that Bob Chapich will have to think about as well. I think there's too much optimism around Disney plus coming into the report. And keep in mind, this comes against a back to it. Look what we heard from Roku this week. A major slowdown in their business. Netflix, probably some squishy areas in its quarter as well, Power Round Plus. Now looking potentially lay people off. It hasn't been a good look in streaming. Hasn't been a good look in streaming. But Disney is not just a streaming company, right? They have a lot of different components to the business. And there's a lot of confidence that they can enter this new world and be very successful at it. If you think about advertising, Disney has a really good base in this. They've really crushed it with Hulu. They have the experience on the linear side. Unfortunately, that adds slowdown. There's not much you can do with that, right? There will be some overhang there. We'll cloud the outlook overall. But overall, I think they're in a good position. They made a lot of investments to Disney plus. We have a lot of exclusive content that's coming to that service disenchanted when the ones that I'm very excited about that's coming. And I think that content spend is going to slow down significantly over the next few quarters and the next few years. And that's going to positively impact Ipa Tess. So a lot of macro concerns, but I think for this company, they're in a really solid position moving forward. And also with Disney, there's the consideration that on the streaming side too, we could see some more focus around ad tiers at a time where Netflix is rolling out and pulled forward the timeline for themselves to launch that. And so now that we've started to see that pop up in the market and perhaps see what some reception looks like, how have the early days been for Netflix? Well, Netflix just launched their ad here in the US. Yesterday, a $6.99 price point slightly below Disney pluses upcoming ad supported tier at $7.99. It's going to be a wait and see approach. We're not going to have all the answers this quarter. I think it's going to take a few quarters so we can really see that impact. I do think across the board, streamers have been exploring price increases, Warner Brothers discovery on the earnings call last night. They actually pushed up the timeline for that combo service between HBO Max and Discovery to the spring. They said there's a lot of options with pricing sort of hinted that price increases will be coming there. And so pricing is something to really focus on when we think about all of these streaming giants. And I think that's a big component that's going to be important in the quarters to come. Look forward to Disney. Woo! Let's get it. I appreciate it. Come now, we're going to check in on the state of the restaurant industry and small business. We'll see you on software company, Lightspeed. That's next. We're going to need to get a Backer logo in here. Let'sиш up below. I'm paying aakat and am doing it to the center.

4828,"cled So, if we're coming to light speed, took a hit this quarter from macro forces, including reduced customer spend at businesses, and 4X swings hitting transaction revenue. But with light speed banking on a move up market, after seeing increased spend, can it close the sale? The shares are higher today after something yesterday following the numbers, and joining us with more is JP Chauvet. He is light speed chief executive officer. JP, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. What are you seeing amongst your clients? And we should tell viewers clients are restaurants, but other types of smaller side businesses as well. What are you hearing from them right now? Yeah, so the majority of our customers are restaurants, and retailers in the SMB space. And really what we're hearing from them, it's a unique moment in time. The post pandemic world with returned physical has created a much more complexity for their businesses, because you have the physical world meets the digital world. And also what we're seeing is that it's a, you know, cost of labor is gone up, scarcity in terms of trying to hire people, and now alluming recession. So it's a really difficult time for our customers, and for the market. And here, the only way forward for our customers is to adopt technologies like cars that can help them do more with less, and automate a lot of the manual tasks. And are they convinced of that, JP? Because as I mentioned, you all had a pretty tough quarter last quarter. You're not just selling software technology to folks. You're also selling hardware in the form of a point of sale system. And are you seeing people retrench, or is it just a matter of seeing slower growth? No, so, depends what you call slower growth. We had a 38% growth the year over year. And if you look at the segment of the customers above $500,000, there was 25% growth in store count, and above a million dollars, we had a 30% growth. So we are a strong growth player. On what we can control, it was a really good quarter. We beat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,16,2022-11-04 14:46:56
4829," 25% growth in store count and above a million dollars, we had a 30% growth. So we are a strong growth player on what we can control. It was a really good quarter. We beat on also an EBITDA and we beat on the outlook. So for us, it was a very good quarter. What hurt us is what we are planning for in the future where we think there'll be a bit of softness, not in terms of our customers and demands, but in terms of the GMV of our customers. And because we are rewarded as a percentage of their revenues, of course, that's going to impact. But still, we are planning very strong growth for the second half of the year. What is the most difficult thing about operating through this particular environment from the CEO perspective? Yeah, well, I mean, you know, this short term versus long term, you know, at light speed, we are a great business. We're building a, you know, we're building a business that's going to last forever. And then you have the daily fluctuations, you know, investor feelings. But I think for us, the way we look at it, we've outlined the plan. We're ahead of this plan and we're doing really well. Now there are things we can't control, you know, currency exchange rates. We do 40% of our business outside of the US. And then the other thing we can't control is consumer buying. But on what we can control, this has been a really good quarter and, and the business is doing really well. J.P., have you followed your colleagues? Excuse me. It appears in tech and implemented hiring freezes or layoffs. Well, most of the companies that are hiring freezes are doing these are, are not companies that are growing the way we are. These are companies that were pure digital. Light speed, the majority of our businesses have physical presences. And as you know, the markets or the consumers have returned to shopping and dining in person. So we are a strong growth story. So we are actually looking today for, I think we have 360 positions open on our website because the company is going to be growing. Now this being said, we have a path to profitability. Next fiscal year, we want to be evict that positive. And we plan on doing that. But, but we have to hire enough people to sustain the growth that we are, we are currently having. And J.P., I'm curious what you're hearing from your clients on the hiring front as well. As you mentioned, restaurants, small retailers, etc. We just got the jobs report today that show there's still growth in things like hospitality jobs, for example. It has a gotten easier for these businesses to find people to hire. And that is actually the biggest issue in our industry is that it's very difficult to hire people right now. Most of the people who are working in the hospitality and the retail space found out a drawups during COVID and left the industry and they're having a hard time getting them back into the industry. So I think that's really what's hurting our customers right now. And that's why we think it's probably a moment in time and a unique moment in time for light speed because the only way out for our customers because they can't hire enough people is to have platforms that help them automate. And unfortunately for the market, the majority of the systems out there right now are legacy platforms that are really not not really efficient in terms of helping them operate in this environment. Have you seen in the data that you're able to kind of glean insights into for all of the businesses that leverage your platform, leverage your service? That there is any major pullback or shift at least in the way that businesses are being able to conduct different services, whether that be on the food front or whether that be on wherever the platform may be, if the consumers are actually pulling back on their spend or shifting dramatically how they're spending. So for now, we haven't, well, we see the big shift we've seen with consumers because we do have also delivery platforms and we also connect with all of the order head platforms. What we have seen very clearly is from the end of the pandemic to today, there's a very, there's a massive return into physical. So that means our customers are selling more and more in their physical spaces. So I think and that's really the complexity right now is that the consumers are still consuming online. They're still using delivery and order ahead, but they're also consuming in the physical space, which means that for the customers, it's more difficult than ever to manage these. And so you often see it, you know, when you go into restaurants and they have four or five iPads and each of every iPad is for, you know, a different delivery network or and that's where we can help them. We can go in and integrate those platforms and make it much simpler for them to run their businesses. So we have seen this big shift and then on a consumer basis, what we've seen is summer was very strong for hospitality. We've seen a lot of people just return to restaurants and we're.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,17,2022-11-04 14:50:59
4830," big shift and then on a consumer basis what we've seen is summer was very strong for hospitality. We've seen a lot of people just return to restaurants and we're starting to see a slight slowdown in terms of of consuming but we are still you know in very healthy healthy volumes. JP, JP great to have you here with us this morning. JP Showa who is the light speed chief executive officer here with us on Yahu of Finance appreciate the time. Thanks for having me. Absolutely everyone let's take a brief look at the markets we've had the Dow ripping to the upside right now by about 500 points on the day it's up 537 540-ish points right now 1.7% in the green the S&P 500 you're also seeing that in the green to the tune of about 1.8% and the NASDAQ composite up 1.8% as well this comes on the back of a better than expected jobs reports but mix because we did have unemployment higher than expected there you're taking a look at some of the actuals versus the estimates or what was anticipated coming into that an hourly wages that inline with expectations as well coming up everyone the earnings parade continues we've got reports from Funko virgin galactic and synomark to talk about on the other side of this break it's going to get funky You You Welcome back. It's time to prep the time and today we focus in on three separate earnings reports one minute each. Let's start with this on the day. Shares of Funko tick or symbol FNK. Oh, it's down bad right now. Oh my god. Missing yet. Oh my gosh indeed. Missing on profit estimates and the money. That's a head of the holidays. Shares moving in a manner that would make everyone bobble their head as we're taking a look at the activity on the day it's down by 50% year. Shrogg. Uh, stunning. It's stunning and it's not no it's you know, I don't think the demand met the company's expectations. We should also know that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,18,2022-11-04 14:55:26
4831," 50% here. Shrug? Stunning. It's stunning. It's not, I don't think the demand met the company's expectations. We should also note that JPMorgan now downgrading the stock. I guess what happened when your stock loses 50%. But they are implementing a lot of new, I think, just processes and machines and technology inside the company to set their foundation for whatever they're looking to do in the future. But this is a massive, massive day of value destruction for fun. It seems like it's not as much the sales that are a problem. It's the profitability that's the problem, the EPS and EBITDA really had a big miss here. And the company is now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin in high single digits for the full year. Previous guidance was around 14.6%. If you look at the midpoint, so that's a big downgrade. Virgin Galactic, we're watching those shares as well. They're up 6% after reporting a wider than expected loss for the third quarter. It did top revenue projections. And most importantly, reaffirmed. It remains on track to launch space tourism services in the second quarter of 2023 and is going to have its commercial spacecraft going up in the middle of next year. I mean, earning shmurnings for this thing. It doesn't obviously make any money yet. But it's all about the timeline here going forward. So that sort of confirmation is encouraging. No, you're making a faceprice. They're selling tickets to space. They're selling tickets to go into sub-oantoresession. Right, inter-resession. Right inter-resession. Like my goodness. Do we really expect it from me? Even the ablwinn community is saying in this economy, right? Like the people who would buy tickets to space. Or not impacted? Or not people who are getting. Yeah, they own text stocks that have been down 80% this year. Even still. I don't know. You're not sold. No, well, I'm not there. I'm not there. I'm not where they're going after. I'm sorry. I'm not buying a ticket. I don't know. Maybe, yeah, maybe on the margins. I don't know. Maybe you put it off a career. Speaking of tickets, shares of a cinema can focus after reporting third quarter earnings, eating expectations on the top line, total revenue, up 50% year over year. As we continue to see the recovery of theatrical movie going, it's good quarter-finished cinema. Not bad. Good to see you. I've been back to a couple of movies as well. So I think that there is a comeback story to be had for the movie theaters. It's just a question of how much they're going to be reliant on titles. Of course, cinema, it's really been a turnaround story that they've needed to initiate from exploring bankruptcy all the way to, okay, how do we just make sure that with any titles that make it into our theater, we're able to stave off competition at the same time. Making sure that you are able to have enough employees to operate this. I think for the experiences that I've had in the theater this year, you could do it without a lot of employees. And I hate to say that, but it is become so streamlined from the point of purchasing digitally to showing up, watching the movie, and then dipping. Yeah, well, the company's adjusted EBITDA is improving and beat estimates, so that's helping matters as well. Kind of speaking to your point about maybe cutting some costs here. The company said August and September were challenged by a dip in content availability. That's code for not a lot of good movies out there, I guess, but anyway, so we're watching that. All right, let's take one last quick quick look at the markets before we leave you. They are in the green up once again after cutting their leads now are almost at the highs of the session.

4832," MUSIC Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11 a.m. on the East Coast. Say it out here in the west. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Happy Friday to all of you. Here's what I'm watching this hour. Mixed signals in the labor market. The US has 261,000 jobs in October blowing past expectations. But the unemployment rate ticks higher to 3.7%. Those hot numbers signaling the Fed will continue to raise rates a little longer. Layoffs at Twitter, thousands of Twitter employees bracing for news this morning. They may be out of the job. It's all part of a new owner and CEO Elon Musk's plan to revamp the social media giant. We're going to have all the details for you coming up. And it is a big morning for door to ash. Shares are surging after a big third quarter earnings beat. We're going to break down the numbers for you. But first let's look at a check of the markets. We are 90 minutes into the trading day. And take a look at how stocks are responding to that strong with unexpected jobs report. The down now up more than 500 points. The S&P 500 up 60 in the Nasdaq up 150. All the major averages. Those still on track to close out the week in the red. With the Nasdaq seeing the steepest losses up today. But it is down on the week. And despite what we're seeing today. The tech heavy index on pace for its worst weekly loss in January of this year. We are beginning this morning, though, with that all important jobs number 261,000 jobs added to the US economy. As unemployment rose to 3.7% in October. Now, as we said, that's a bit of a mixed report coming just days ahead of the midterm elections where Democrats are struggling to convince voters. They can get the job done on the economy. Let's bring in Yahoo finances. Rick Newman and Rick, you know, it's interesting because we've been talking so much about these job numbers as in good news. Not necessarily good news for the markets today. The markets are up. But if you think about where President Biden has positioned himself, especially going into the midterms. Is this good news for the Democrats? I can't tell to honestly, but I mean, let's just let's start with the headline number 261,000 new jobs. I mean, the strength in the job market is astonishing. Economists keep saying we expect the labor market to slow down. We expect job growth to slow down. And it keeps not slowing down. No, we are not adding jobs at the pace we were doing right after the the COVID downturn when suddenly every employer had to catch up. But in a normal economy in a decently growing economy, if you had just 200,000 new jobs per month, that would be a terrific pace of growth. And we've had far more than that all year long and the slow down just keeps not coming. And yet I'm looking at all these analyses today and everybody's disappointed. Everybody was hoping that there would be clearer signs of a slowing job market. And why is that because everybody wants the Fed to stop raising interest rates. And in order to do that, the Fed needs to see signs that a recession is coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,20,2022-11-04 15:04:08
4833," And why is that? Because everybody wants the Fed to stop raising interest rates. And in order to do that, the Fed needs to see signs that a recession is coming, that job gains are slowing, that wage gains are slowing. So, you know, it's great that we're adding all these new jobs. And it's unfortunate that everybody is disappointed about that. I mean, with that said, right, you know, what does this mean in terms of messaging and the final days leading up to the midterms? We've heard the president go out and say, look, the economy is still strong, but voters are looking at where inflation is and saying, how do you look at both in contact? Biden cannot win on the, he cannot win this messaging battle. He has had a strong labor market to brag about all year long. And it hasn't worked. And it just tells you how pervasive inflation is. And it tells you how ruinous inflation is for family budgets. I mean, I just did some new analysis this weekend. One of the ironies here is that even though inflation is improving, the rate of inflation has declined from a high of 9% down to, it's now 8.2%. People are actually saying, giving signs that they are getting more worried about inflation, not less worried. And I think for a couple of reasons, number one, the longer it lasts, the longer people think it's going to last. So inflation expectations for the next six to 12 months are very high. People think price, these price hikes are going to stay. And I think another thing that's happening is the longer people have to deal with inflation, the more it streams their, their family budget. So, you know, we got the wage and number today average hour learning is 4.7%. Ordinarily, that would be great. But with inflation at 8.2%, your paycheck buys less. People are literally falling behind and the more, and the longer that goes on, the worse it is for the incumbent Democrats. So it looks like Biden and his fellow Democrats are going to lose at least one Chamber of Congress next week. I think the only question is, are the polls accurate? If the polls are accurate, then it's going to be a bad night for Democrats. So if Democrats are hoping for anything at all at this point, it's at the polls are wrong. And really quickly, Rick, for the Republican side of things, you know, they've certainly seen strength in the economy. At least, you know, that they see that things, at least voters are not necessarily optimistic about where the economy is headed. That's positive for the Republicans. They look at the jobs number today. How do you think they spend this one? They are there. It's the same way they've been spinning it. They just keep pointing to inflation. And that's all they need to do. So I don't think you're going to hear any Democrats saying much, excuse me, Republicans saying much at all about the labor market. They're just going to keep saying Americans cannot afford the basics. And they're not wrong about that. Yeah, just hammering home the word inflation seems to be working for the Republican so far. Rick Newman is always thanks so much for that. For deeper insight, look on what the latest jobs data means for the Fed and the U.S. economy. Let's get right to ADP chief economist Nila Richardson. Nila is Rick said, you know, when you think about the tight labor market, that has really been one of the biggest hurdles for the Fed and its attempt to cool off the economy. What are the numbers today tell you about how much more the Fed needs to do to get it where they want it to be? Hi, great to be with you. Look, the Fed may not be able to go through the labor market to get to lower inflation. I think that's what the numbers tell us today. We're seeing really steady and robust job gains. The BLS report today was pretty broad base. Little different than what the ADP numbers showed earlier this week in terms of the broadness of the hiring. But in terms of the number of jobs created, we showed 239,000 private sector jobs. The BLS was 230 free, so you're seeing the same kind of alignment when it comes to these monthly job gains. For the Fed, that means that it's not the labor market that's seeing weakness. It's things like housing and maybe stocks, but not the stock market today. So they have their work cut out for them. Yeah, it's been interesting to see the reaction and the past we've sort of seen the strong jobs numbers kind of lead to declines in the broader market. What do you put this in context for us right now? Because you said, look, it's not necessarily the labor market that the Fed has to deal with. It's other areas like housing. Are there other levers that you think the central bank can be pulling when you consider that the rate hikes they've implemented so far haven't necessarily led to a significant cooling off of the labor market? You know, the Fed has fundamentally won.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,21,2022-11-04 15:08:19
4834," The rate hikes they've implemented so far haven't necessarily led to a significant cooling off of the labor market. You know, the Fed has fundamentally won move, and that's rate hikes. Unfortunately, they can go faster, they can go slower, but they're still going to hike rates. I think what we are anticipating, at least I am, is that not just that they hike, but that they hike and they stay at an elevated federal funds rate for a period of time to bring back inflation. The bottom line is, when you look at the labor market, when you look at consumer spending, this is a long game for the Fed. It is not a short game, and that means that rates are likely to stay higher for longer than was originally anticipated by the Fed. Wage gain is certainly something we've been keeping a watch on. As we know, so many companies have had to deal with the higher cost that have come with a very tight labor market. Early earnings up 0.4% in October from the previous month, we are seeing a slight cooling down if you can call it that. But what are you hearing from employers who are saying, look, we can't necessarily fill the jobs, but maybe we don't necessarily have to dangle the same incentives we did six months ago. Well, 80 PPS1 and six workers in the United States. We have a lot of payroll data. When we look at pay growth, what we're saying is exactly what you see in this BLS report, it's exactly what Powell pointed to in this press release, that wage growth is slowing, but it's slowing to and stabilizing at an elevated level. It's still much higher than it was this time last year. So wages are not likely pushing up inflation, but it may keep inflation prolonged at the current level. And what we're hearing from our clients, especially our small business clients, is that it's still a tough time finding qualified workers, especially in consumer facing industries like restaurants, leisure and hotel accommodations. And so there's still a struggle here for the smaller firms who were out competed by larger firms earlier on in the recovery. Now is there chance to hire some of these larger firms take a pause? It's been a situation of good news, sometimes being bad news. And this report specifically, I guess the bad news that could be good news is that unemployment did tick a little higher. We're talking about 3.7%, which is still historically pretty low. I mean, how much higher do you think that number needs to go in order to see a real cooling up? Well, I focus on the real economy on the jobs market. So good jobs numbers are good news always. And I think the unemployment number we have to put it in context. It's still below 4%. It's still at historical lows. That number is coming from the household survey, which is a little less reliable. That number, the 3.7% is likely going to take up back and forth over the next couple of months. But the punchline here is that we're still seeing job gains. And if you match that data to the initial jobless claims numbers that are still around pre-pandemic levels, we're not seeing a lot of firms starting to lay off. And that's good news for Main Street. Main Street is the bulk of the economy. So that's good news for economic growth. Yeah, a lot of the layoff news largely focused on places like tech we did here, but higher increases in places like Amazon as well as Lyft. But we'll continue to watch that. And let's get to have you on today. Nila Richardson, ADP Chief Economist. And here to take a closer look at the market action following today stronger than expected jobs data. We've got Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickery standing by. And Jared, this is a big pop that we're seeing on the back of a strong jobs number. Yes, we are. And it's somewhat reminiscent to me of that big pop we got after the last CPI report, which should have been bearish by all accounts because it was coming in pretty hot. But guess what? The market is reacting pretty strongly. S&P 500 up over 1.25%. And the Dow is really outperforming. Let me just put a five-day chart here. And we can see the Dow is still down about 1.25% for the week. But it has come back to the mid-range of that five-day range. Nasdaq still hovering down below. And boy, it has been a story of two different markets here when you consider tech and the value trade that's more heavily represented by the S&P 500 and the Dow. So here's the S&P 500. We're just kind of chopping around down here. 3,900.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,22,2022-11-04 15:12:40
4835," tech and the value trade that's more heavily represented by the S&P 500 in the Dow. So here's the S&P 500. We're just kind of chopping around down here, 3,900, excuse me, 3,900, which is right here is a huge level and also this breakdown region from the Fed the other day, 3,800, also going to be big as kind of where we stop today. But all in all, I think investors will take this, especially after the carnage that they suffered just a few days ago at the hands of Pauline Cole. By the way, today materials in the forefront, that's a story about China potentially re-opening along with consumer discretionary financials, energy staples and industrials, nice mix to see their Akiko. And finally, Jared, we're seeing a pretty broad-based gains today in the market. But want to hone in on the energy space here, oil seeing a big pop today. We got that news from G7 countries that they had agreed to how exactly this Russian oil price cap would be implemented. And what more can you tell us about how exactly this is likely this way in terms of where oil prices are likely to move? Sure. The thinking now is that it's going to be a fixed price limit instead of one that varies with the price of oil. The number that I've seen floating around is $60 per barrel. You can see WTI here, which trades pretty closely to Brent Crude. That's up 4% today. I think that's more on the reports that we're getting a possible re-opening of China based on the fact that they may be rescinding the Zerocovid, or at least revising that policy here today. But there is that European, I guess, ban sanctions that go into effect on December 5th. So this is ahead of that. I don't think it's going to be a huge deal for the oil market. I think it's going to come down to the demand characteristics. And especially with these marginal swings that we've seen with respect to China, maybe a few other places. But you look at the broad complex and commodities, say, a lot of green, a lot of dark green, and guess what? We're also seeing the US dollar come down appreciably, particularly against the Renminbi over in China. Yeah, a lot of countries looking at that and saying there's some relief and slight potentially. Jared Vlickery, thanks so much for that. Let's take a look at shares of Funko, failing to get the poppings looking for after disappointing earnings. That stock is down more than 50%. That's right. The company behind the collectible figurines reported earnings of $0.28 a share in revenue of $365.6 million. That was higher than this three expected, but weak guidance for the all-important holiday season for shares plummeting. The company now expects holiday growth and profit to remain relatively flat from the same period last year. That prompted JP Morgan to downgrade the stock from overweight to neutral, the firm slashing Funko's price target in half the $16 a share. Well, coming up on the other side Starbucks credits customers adding more stuff like Syrups to their coffee for its earnings beat, and that trend continue. We'll talk to an analyst after the short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,23,2022-11-04 15:17:10
4836," Konstantina.... Well, investors giving shares of Starbucks a big jolt in the session today. That stock is up nearly 10%. The coffee chain posted a record quarter attributing its success to rising prices, even despite some economic headwinds. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Brooke DiPala, who's all over the numbers for us and Brooke, you know, the good news is domestically there are consumers who are spending more per visit, but there's some headwinds over these. We'll get to that, but let's sort of start on the domestics of the positive news first. Yeah, Kiko, some positive news here is that although McDonald's, those Starbucks is not have a jingle like McDonald's Starbucks and Wall Street are certainly singing to the tune of this fiscal fourth quarter report. Wall Street, tier today, Starbucks having the best day since May shares of nearly 10% in two hours into trading day here. Now, as you noted here, despite them setting higher prices in Q3, they did give us a bit of an estimate there that they raised about 5% over the past 12 months. But that actually did lead to higher revenue here, record $8.4 billion. Here in the US, seems to sell sales jumped by 11%. Thanks to a 10% increase in average ticket price. But just how long will that momentum continue and can customers expect another price hike? Starbucks, the above Rachel, are you are you are waiting this morning with Yahoo Finance? Really in response to inflationary pressures. We'll have some of that this year based on annualization from moves we made last year, but we expect our pricing to return to actions that are more on a historical level. What we focus on is really how do we sustain that ticket? Because it isn't just pricing, it's actually volume as well. We've seen our customers purchase more that's evidence in attach, increased attach. So we're seeing increased volume. Now some of those offerings of what they consider that are driving volumes include customization here about 60% of beverages are now customized, modifiers have grown in double digits. And that includes stuff like pumpkin spice syrup, or pepper mocha, syrup is going into your coffee. But Rachel continued to emphasize that the partners and as you noted labor inflation, certainly coming into consideration here, driving this demand that Starbucks is willing to fill, also Rachel emphasized that they continue to believe that a side by side relationship with partners is most important in this organization efforts continuum. Side note, Brooke, it looks like you and Rachel were wearing the same top. I didn't know. We have the same color. I was going to leave her drink. We were talking about China because we did see a double digit decline in same source sales there. There's been some rumors floating around this week that potentially China could ease its zero-covid policy. What more did we hear from Starbucks about what that's likely to mean for their second largest market? Yeah, well, like so many US consumer brands, Starbucks is certainly hoping and weighing and ultimately, you know, super bullish on the fact that this COVID-19 zero policy will be lifted soon. It's really taking a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,24,2022-11-04 15:21:22
4837," And ultimately, you know, super bullish on the fact that this COVID-19 zero policy will be lifted soon. Starbucks really taking a leader position here, ultimately weighing in and continuing to grow. Now there's nearly 6,000 stores opening up in China. And Rachel emphasized that they're actually moving towards a digital there in the midst of mobility not being back to where it was pre-sendemic. She said that 44% of the overall sales are digital now. And then once mobility lifts, they expect those stores to operate and continue to grow. Howard Schultz also super optimistic here. He strongly believes that they will come out of this pandemic as the number one Western consumer brand. So certainly something that's keeping eye on and will continue to follow how exactly that performs on Wall Street. Yeah, that's certainly been a key market for Starbucks for a very long time. A book thanks so much for that. Let's give the conversation going on Starbucks. We've got Sarah Senator, Bank of America, Senior Restaurant Analyst. Sarah, let me just start with your takeaways from the numbers that we got. A bit of a mixed results. I mean, positive things are moving in the right direction, but still some headwinds abroad. Yeah, I would say more positive than negative. So from the perspective of the US, you know, certainly one of the, if not the best, same-store sales numbers, we've seen come out of the earnings season this quarter. The fact that they had 10 points of check is certainly a reflection on, you know, as as earlier was said, people adding food, people customizing. But also, you know, they said they did have positive transactions, which is a real rarity in this operating environment right now. So that combination was really, I think, very unique and a testament to how strong the brand is and the affinity that customers have. You know, outside of the US, very, very strong results with the exception of course of China, where we know lockdowns led to really intense mobility constraints. But even there, the same-store sales were better than people had anticipated. So really recovering very nicely when some of these restrictions are lifted. And again, I think a reflection of how strong the brand is and the ability to start with connected with consumers in that market. And is well positioned as when the lockdown restrictions ultimately are lifted. You know, Starbucks are only not unique in raising some of their prices. We have seen so many food restaurants, you know, really try to make up for the additional cost they're having to pay for. But I wonder how much more pricing power you think Starbucks has? Well, I think you make a very good point there, which is that Starbucks is not unique. And in fact, Starbucks has actually taken less price or smaller price increases your rear than most in the industry. So if you look at the consumer price index for food away from home, which is restaurants, you see that that's up, you know, 8%, 9%. I think about 7.5%, 8% year-to-date more recently. If you look at some of the other restaurants in the industry who have reported 5%, 6%, which is what Starbucks says on their menu is actually very low end of the range. So typically we're hearing prices more in the 8% range. McDonald's took 10 to pull away, took about 11 and a half on their menu. So to have 6% price increase your rear really is exceptional, but only in the sense that it's lower than what you're seeing at most other restaurants. And finally, Sarah, I want to get back to the point you made about China. I mean, certainly the expectation seems to be that if there is some softening on a zero-covid policy activity picked up, people go back into stores. You know, these are all positives, especially for retailers like Starbucks, but we're also looking at some significant downturn in terms of the economy, in terms of the broader growth that we're seeing on employment higher in the second largest market there. What's a realistic expectation about how much Starbucks can return to what extent Starbucks can return to pre-pandemic levels in China? Well, I think, you know, a couple things. One is just in terms of thinking about the pace of growth that Starbucks has in China. Big part of it has been new unit growth. So same-store sales will certainly be prior to COVID, or healthy in that kind of 3 to 4% range, but really the big driver of growth and a value creation for Starbucks and for Chinese consumers has been opening up new restaurants. So, you know, the expectations that they can continue to do that at a low-down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,25,2022-11-04 15:25:37
4838," of growth and a value creation for Starbucks and for Chinese consumers has been opening of new restaurants. So, you know, the expectations that they can continue to do that at a low double digit pace, certainly if you look at the store base, you know, it's roughly 6,000, that compares to the U.S. of over 14 or 15,000. So, you know, think about the relative size of the population. It certainly would seem to suggest that they're targeted about 9,000 stores in China's eminently achievable. So, I don't see reason to think that that universe has to slow. To your point, you know, Starbucks is very cognizant of the economic pressures facing the country, but I think, you know, what they have done so well in the last few years is really adapt their loyalty program and make sure that they can really speak directly to customers one to one, which I think is very important at all times, but certainly as consumers are thinking about their budget, as they're thinking about where they want to spend their discretionary dollars. Sarah Seneswar, Bank of America Senior Restaurants Analyst, it's good to talk to you tonight, really appreciate the time. Well, coming up thousands of Twitter employees to be losing their jobs today already a lawsuit in the works on the back of that. And we're going to tell you about it after the break. We're going to have some executive visitors. We know everything in meteor for four times more than 30瑈 hit the message. We already begun it at twitter thousands of employees are expected to employed by the company coming just one week after Elon Musk acquired the social media company. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexis Keenan, who has the details. Alexis, we know there's also lawsuits here over these layoffs. The timeline, we were told 9 a.m. Pacific is when employees are likely to get the notice, but it sounds like some of those have already gone out. Yes, so Akiko, here's what we know. We're expecting that these layoffs could be impacting as many as 50% of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,26,2022-11-04 15:30:14
4839," Some of those have already gone out. Yes, so Akiko, here's what we know. We're expecting that these layoffs could be impacting. As many as 50 percent of Twitter's workforce that noticed went out yesterday telling employees that they would get word as to whether they still had a job by 9 a.m. Pacific time. But Twitter has said that it is necessary to do these layoffs, to place Twitter on a healthy path. That's what the company said, according to the Wall Street Journal. And over the past five years though, we should also note that Twitter's ranks have indeed swelled in 2021. The company added about 2000 jobs. That was a jump of 36 percent over 2020. Now the lawsuit that you mentioned, that was filed from employees yesterday. Employees that still had their jobs. Only one of the plaintiffs, purporting a class action lawsuit in California's Federal District Court, saying that they believe that they are anticipating these layoffs and because of them, they would like to say that Twitter is violating a law called the Warn Act. Now there's a state level law for that as well as a federal law. And what it requires is that employers that have 100 or more workers, they have to give 60 days advance written notice when a layoff is going to impact 50 or more employees at a company or a third of the total workforce. It also applies when there's going to be a single site layoff that impacts 500 or more employees that one applies within 90 days. Now there are some penalties associated if there is a violation found by the court. Those penalties include back pay of those 60 days that the employees would have missed, as well as $500 per day per employee so those numbers can add up. And also medical expenses if employees were to have to incur medical expenses without medical insurance during that period. There are some exceptions, though, to that rule and we would expect that in defending itself, Twitter may invoke some of these defenses and they include unforeseen circumstances, business circumstances for the company. So that lawsuit, it's a little bit early having been filed yesterday, but I would think that the court, if those employees are in fact fired, would then give them the opportunity to go forward. But again, it is a class action that is purported to be on behalf of all employees that would be similarly situated. There's certainly a lot that's happened in the week since Elon Musk acquired the company. One thing we know he's not happy about is companies pausing their ad buys on Twitter and he tweeted this a short time ago saying Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups pressuring advertisers. Even the nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists. Extremely messed up. They're trying to destroy free speech in America. We've already seen a number of major companies, at least one major agency saying we want to just hold off on advertising anything until we get a better sense of what this platform looks like. I mean, how is this exit likely to accelerate? Yeah. So it's hard to say, Akiko, you can see there on the screen. These are the companies that have actually come out and publicly stated that they're going to do a pause. They're going to wait to see what content moderation will be about at Twitter under Musque. We have General Mills, you have Vokes Wagon and Audi as well as Pfizer and General Motors. So that's just a few. As far as these groups, we don't know exactly who Elon Musk is talking about. We are reaching out and we will ask him who exactly he thinks is exerting this level of pressure. Okay. I like the screen and on top of the story, thanks so much for that. Well, Twitter is not the only company doing layoffs, lift, stripe, and open door. All announced this week, they're going to be cutting their staff for other companies that are not doing layoffs, but they're not hiring either among them are Qualcomm and Amazon, which says putting a pause on hiring, quote, new incremental hires. Even apples reportedly freezing hiring because of concerns about the economy flowing. And we continue to see that list, especially of tech companies, pausing or cutting jobs growing longer. We're coming up door to ashes, delivering for investors and consumers are still spending on food delivery. Can that growth continue?

This is a very strong quarter for door dash at a time when we've heard about consumers pulling back on spending. But we did hear the company caution that consumers spending could deteriorate faster or greater degree than we anticipate. These are their words. What did you take away from the numbers we got yesterday in terms of how these higher costs are starting to weigh on consumers and how that could potentially affect things on the platform? That's an interesting question. Thanks for having me. I think there's a couple things going on that are sort of encouraging to investors this morning. One is what you just point out is the resiliency of their demand, their gross order value growth. It was up substantially, including with an acquisition they did in Europe, which I was concerned about, called woe, which was up 60% year over year from a much smaller base, but still very good growth. And the second thing is I think what they're doing and which was smart is providing a little bit more insight into how profitability is growing. So there's a lot of investment going on, which they've always advertised since the IPO, but now they're providing insight into the core growth in their restaurant business where their profits are up like 50% year over year. So there's a lot of good incremental money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,28,2022-11-04 15:38:29
4841," insight into the core growth in their restaurant business, where their profits are up like 50% year over year, and where they're seeing very good incremental margins. So I think that was encouraging as well to investors. Yeah, the good news for DoorDash is that users are still on the platform and ordering. It did sound though that like they're starting to see some trade downs. It's not necessarily the high end restaurants have used order from there. You're still on the platform, but you're ordering from other areas that may come with a cheaper price point. When at what point do you think because of the higher cost overall, some users start to say, well, maybe I don't need that delivery as frequently as I used to use it. Well, it's also important to remember that when you look at their numbers, there's inflation embedded into their top line, right? Because you're buying a pizza that costs 10 or 15% more than it did a year ago. And then when you look at what's going on with the consumer specifically, what they think they're seeing is smaller basket sizes. So maybe instead of ordering that extra egg roll or the extra pizza, you're being more proficient with how much leftovers you want. So that's happening as well. I think in general, if you look at consumer trends, they are generally holding up because one, this is a very under penetrated market. There's no area where they're more than 10% of their available market, whether you're geographically or by restaurants, et cetera. And then secondly, food is going to be less cyclical. And then thirdly, as they add subscribers, those subscribers generally are more frequent users of the app, especially as they add new categories like groceries and convenience stores, which are really gaining scale now. Door to Door to Door is certainly unique in that they've largely been focused on deliveries. When you look at their competitor, for example, like Uber, they've obviously got the right hailing side, the food side, to your point, we've seen Door Dash diversify their offerings. But when you look at those two names side by side, who do you think is better position to write out some of these economic headwinds? That's a really interesting question. I think at this point, given how strong the travel backdrop is, especially in the U.S., that Uber would be the preferred play overall. It's not to say that Door Dash in and of itself doesn't have a viable business model that's going to be successful over the long term. But if you're trying to balance risk and reward, Uber is actually priced at a more attractive valuation, we think, and offers you that hedge with the travel component, which is very strong right now. Finally, when you look at where you are with the stock, you've got a equal weight rating on the stock. What would it take for you, or what would you need to see to change that? So what we tried to express in our report this morning is that there's been some incremental changes in terms of how we understand the business and how they're expressing what's going on with the business to investors. Most importantly, on the incremental profits that are dropping down, you can get a better feel for some of these investments turning to scale. That does lead you to believe that EBITDA growth can be stronger next year. I think we need to see a little bit more performance relative to the current macro into the end of the year. I think what they printed yesterday and what they got it to is definitely going to put a firm floor on the stock. It's probably going to be volatile for a while, and then we'll evaluate it going forward. But we were definitely intrigued by what we saw off of that print. It certainly looks like you're not the only one if you look at the stock creation today. Stephen Fox, Fox Advisors, Fever CEO, get to have you on. Thank you. Well, take a look at shares of Coinbase.

Well, coming up the US added 261,000 jobs in October, we're going to do a deeper dive into two of the sectors where we saw significant growth that's coming up after this break. Employment and leisure and hospitality continue to trend up in October, with 35,000 jobs added for the month, although the sector as a whole is still 6.5% below its February 2020 level. Joining me now to discuss trends in the sectors, Nicholas, Lillio, Cesar CEO of NALSTDA, comprehensive workforce management platform. Nicholas, good to talk to you today. Let's start by talking about how exactly you are sort of at this intersection here. You've got pretty good visibility on the hiring in this specific space, but how's your software support all that? Yeah, great. Thanks for having me here. I'm excited to tell you about what we do. So at a high level, we're an operating system for hourly gig and flex workforces. As we all know, there's been immense challenges that these workforces are currently facing. What our platform does is help employers find workers, and it also helps them manage them. We're really oriented around helping employers transform into flex and dynamic workforces, moving away from the traditional 40-hour work week and allowing them to better access different pools of labor. We have a platform called FlexPool that aggregates a bunch of labor sources in a particular area, and essentially gives employers access to logistics and other opportunities to engage with this workforce so they can ensure that they're fully staffed. So it's kind of what we do. So what's the data that you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,30,2022-11-04 15:47:29
4843," opportunities to engage with this workforce so they can ensure that they're fully staffed. So, it's kind of what we do. So, what is the data that you have there through your platform? What does that tell you about how many workers are looking for a little more flexibility, but more importantly, how competitive the pay is for those who are looking for those types of jobs? Yeah, absolutely. So, workers are looking for flexibility. I think employers have been slow to embrace the idea that flexible work is here to stay. And they're struggling to find workers who are willing to work 40-50 hours a week. Workers want to be able to choose when they work. They might want to work 15 hours this week, 20 hours the following week. And they have to adapt to the fact that workers have preferences that don't necessarily align with what employers want. So, what we've been really oriented around is helping them better access pools of labor that allow them to work with these types of workers. We give them tools to help them schedule. We allow them to better and more easily track these workers. So, there's a fundamental change in the labor market and employers are just struggling to find people. It's very challenging out there. And we're showing on the screen there some of the top cities that are most attractive for flex workers right now, New York, Atlanta, LA, Denver, and Dallas. You know, we have seen employers increasingly turn to a little more flexible work schedule, largely because of need. What are you hearing from them about their ability to fill these job posts once they add a little more leeway into the scheduling? Yeah, so they're seeing huge increases in their ability to fill jobs when they adopt flex. They're realizing that workers are more productive, they're happier, they're more able to work when they can choose the terms on which they work. And so employers that have embraced it have seen tremendous results with that. Now, it doesn't mean that employers aren't facing challenges with the increased complexity with flex work. But on the whole, the employers who adopt flex work are seeing much higher fill rates than employers who have not. And where are some of the biggest employers utilizing your software? So, we work with dozens of pro sports teams, most of the major hotel and hospitality brands like Marriott, Milwaukee Brewer's, those types of entities. We also work with Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 big box retailers, warehouses, distribution centers, those types of entities. Now, Cecio, Nicholas, Lillios, joining us in our New York video. Good to have you on today. Thank you. Well, employment and healthcare rose by 53,000 in the month of October. That is 13 consecutive months of additions for the sector. The industry has been hiring at a rapid pace this year, about 47,000 jobs a month this year versus the 9,000 back in 2021. Angeloi Kamlani here to look at a kind of an interesting angle in this space. Angeloi, I know you've been looking at where these job postings are and you found an interesting trend. I did. Actually, it started off with sort of an anecdotal hearing about a rise in chief medical officers at corporate America, and especially during the pandemic. And so I started looking into that. And what I found was really interesting. Not only did we see sort of a shift in what was happening. So you mentioned that those gains in the past year, but let's turn the clock back a little bit. What we saw was actually a drop in the number of healthcare jobs and those with medical training for the entire year of 2021, or reporting to at least 300,000 lost jobs in that year alone. Meanwhile, of course, we've seen the gains since then and in the past year, but chief medical officers that saw a spike during the pandemic. So start off with 2019, just 767 job postings. Meanwhile, going to 2020 30, 400, 2021 more than 5,000 and now in 2022 to date nearly 3000 alone. So that just tells you the story of sort of where this mass exodus is of these medically trained individuals and especially doctors getting opportunities in health tech and startups in corporate America at senior level positions to really help guide companies who are now starting to re-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,31,2022-11-04 15:51:38
4844," Getting opportunities in health tech and startups in corporate America at senior level positions to really help guide companies who are now starting to realize the importance of having a trained physician or a trained clinician on board to not just keep their employees healthy, but also in the event of another pandemic, which we know experts are wary about and been warning about, to have someone in-house who they can consult in a time of need. Yeah, you know, that was kind of my question, Angelina, and it makes sense in something like health tech to have a chief medical officer when you're talking sort of traditional corporate America. I mean, what does that job entail, number one, but what is the incentive for these companies who are not necessarily in health care to be hiring for this? Well, like I said, the pandemic is one thing, but really beyond that, we know that health care is one of the most costliest expenses for companies, right? Sales for CMO, Githin, Iar told me that it's the most expensive cost on the balance sheet for companies. So, having that to look at, it means that companies really need to look at a way to not only drop costs, but also address some of the issues. Having a clinician can advise on preventative measures, on preventative services, on mental health as well. So, all of that is coming together now with all of these companies that you can see on your screen. These are the ones that have either had chief medical officers or brought one on board during the pandemic in order to respond to the pandemic. And all of these officers told me there's definitely room for growth in this area. Yeah, it certainly makes sense when you consider just, um, health-up, but a lot of these companies were caught, less food during the pandemic. I actually think so much for that. Well, coming up those looking for a job in New York City, I'm now going to know something job seekers in other cities don't. How much that job pays. We're going to tell you more about it after the break. Well, this week in New York City, all job listings must now include salary range. That's according to the New York City Commission on Human Rights. The salary listings must have a maximum and a minimum and will be based on good faith of the employer. For more on this, let's bring in Yahoo Finance, the Danny Romero on how New York City employers are starting to comply. You know, there's a lot of employees that I know are curious about what the range is for similar jobs, but how quickly has compliance come up to date and what are the some of the challenges that employers are facing?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,32,2022-11-04 15:56:06
4845," that I know are curious about what the range is for similar jobs, but how quickly has compliance come up to date and what are the some of the challenges that employers are facing? Look, Akiko, I mean, I feel like what we're seeing is that employers are really testing the limits with this new transparency law here in New York City that requires posting those salary ranges. I mean, some employers even posted very broad salary ranges that the difference is over $100,000 for this one position. So it's leaving applicants confused when they are looking into these job postings, but the law requires that all companies with four or more employees to produce a good faith salary range, something that the employers are willing to pay for that candidate, and it's expected to benefit four million private sector workers and employers will get a 30-day warning to correct any violations before facing fines. So we did seek some companies jump on this bandwagon and comply before the rollout of this law, Bank of America was one of them, JP Morgan City Group Comcast, that's just to name a few, Akiko. And other states like Colorado have started to roll out this pay transparency law as well. What does that mean for the broader labor market? I mean, does that give employees a little more leverage, let's say, because of the transparency? I mean, I feel like we could see this pay transparency law really roll out across the nation. I mean, California is the next one up and they're expected to roll out their pay transparency law next year in January. So if we consider the states that have rolled out so far, which include Colorado, New York, and soon to be California, I mean, it could impact one in six workers that is according to pay scale. So considering these laws, I mean, these laws really aim to close the gap and racial pay gap. And those gaps are larger for women. I mean, women make 83 cents for for every dollar, men earn. And for women of color, the gap is even wider. So there has been some backlash, Akiko from some of these Wall Street banks that say that it forces them to disclose too much to their rivals. But on the flip side, Akiko, this really touches upon the fact that maybe we're talking maybe talking about your salary or even being transparent about it is no longer taboo. I mean, we can see on TikTok, some of these Gen Zers make reels asking people what's your job? How much do you make? So we're really seeing a change in demographics right now. Okay, a bit of a shift in the labor market there. Danny Romero, thanks so much for that. That doesn't for me in this 11 o'clock hour. We obviously were going to be covering and continue to cover the market reaction to that jobs report today. Keep it right here in Yahoo!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,33,2022-11-04 16:00:23
4846," Here is the Caution of a After the snack brand reported, it's 11th straight quarter of over 9% revenue growth and said higher prices count to 420% of the rise. Hostess Brandt, CEO, Annie Callan joins us now to discuss and you always nice to see here. We're sure getting some pretty good reads on consumers back out there traveling and moving around. What are you seeing in your brand within convenience stores? Yeah, well, you know, the breath of our portfolio is pretty wide across all channels. We do see a lot of resiliency. You know, we have an on the go or high impulse category. Consumers are back traveling. We're in two spaces, both with macro trends and tailwinds behind us for our split vacates. And one of them is indulgent and permissible snacking of which our portfolio and Twinkie fits the bill. Convenience is very resilient. Consumers are still traveling and they're going through whether it's around the home more. When they're in the round the home more, they're traveling around the home more. That's good for our business and when they're driving more, that's good for our business. So we're really seeing a lot of resiliency, including in our convenience channel, which point of sale grew above 13% this last quarter. And I'm also curious, Andy H. Julie here, which categories, which subcategories are doing the best right now? What's sort of the hottest product out there? Well, our core icons always do well. We're pre-packed. Most of our portfolio is prepared for snacking and our two iconic brands or iconic brand hostess with all of its subbrands as well as our boardman portfolio, which is a little bit more than 10% of portfolio are both performing well. By the way, boardman point of sale was up 28.8%. So we see indulgent snacking on total, a really continuing half trailwinds. That's been before the pandemic and that's now today. And we really have a pure play snacking portfolio. So we're well positioned to capitalize on that growth with the assets to achieve that growth. We see morning breakfast continuing to grow. That's a $5.8 billion segment. We recently launched Bound Show that really attacks the lunch box occasion at $6.2 billion in total consumer occasions. So this indulgent snacking is really moving across the board in the faces of we compete. Our boardman portfolio, by the way, is the number one share within sugar free for cookies and $8 billion total category, but it's growing and more than twice a rate of total cookies. So we were really positioned well for macro consumer trends. Andy, you've put up several good quarters in a row now. What is it about a twinkie or the other products that you're selling? There are other snacks out there. Had you survey folks on why they're gravitating to your brands? Well, there's a couple of things. First of all, even during times of recession or when times are good, consumers reach for permissible and indulgent snacks that they feel are at an accessible price point. We're maniacal and making sure we provide the right value to our consumers when they have. The other thing that we really spend a lot of time over the last three or four years is focusing on our product quality. So when consumers come and they want an indulgent snack, they want it to be a good reward. They don't need a lot, but they need it in a portion controlled form. We've invested in product quality, our penetration and households is going up. But also, we're accessing and adding two times buyer to our category, to our franchise, to our host's business, as greater than twice the rate of the rest of the category. That means when consumers come and try us, they'd like it and they're coming and repeating. So we're doing all of the fundamentals at right. I don't top of that are increasing advertising to build the gap between our aided awareness and top of mind awareness and our innovation. And you get a recipe for 11 straight quarters above 9 percent growth. Andy, you talked about holding the line on value at the same time you did take price, right? So, you també進 already. Now when you did a speech for your public comment on the title, that city offer,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,34,2022-11-04 16:04:52
4847," and our innovation and you get a recipe for 11 straight quarters above 9% growth. Andy, you talked about holding the line on value at the same time you did take price, right? Because that's one of the things, or the main thing that was responsible for the revenue bump here. So how do you calculate that A and B, what happens to price now going forward? Are you going to keep on raising? As we sit here today, what we see, especially as we close out the years to, we're only talking about 23, we have the pricing in the marketplace to obviously deliver our raised guidance. We raised our revenue and top and bottom line guidance for the full year of FY22. This is the way we look at it. We take the value that we deliver to consumers very serious. And then we also have a suite of tools that we love. We utilize to leverage the efficiency of which we deliver them. We balance both of those. So in the quarter despite having a 20% pricing that move through the consumer, our gross margin still contracted a little less than 100 basis points. We believe over time given our revenue growth management initiatives, our productivity initiatives. And when needed, when we get this high of inflation, it was above 18% in the quarter, as a last resort, we do move the pricing. So that's why pricing's in the marketplace now. We think we have the right balance going forward, but given our agility and our continued focus on the fundamentals, if needed, we're in a position to do that. We don't believe we are today. We do, we are committed to, by the way, of recovering our gross margins over time. And as a reminder, our growth algorithm is to a mid single digit top line growth at five to seven percent EBITDA growth and seven and nine percent EPS growth. We believe we'll continue, even from this point forward, despite our incredible performance of the last three years, lead to top tier shareholder return. Andy, real quick, before I let you go, what is your one big product that you're going to launch next year? Anything you could take us inside the C-suite? Well, we're in the process right now of launching our bouncer. So bouncer's is our focus. It targets a lunchbox occasion. It reimagines some of our icons like Twinkies and DingDons and Donets. It puts it in a poppable form, a two-by-poppable form. And it's perfect for the lunchbox or any carried occasion. Retailer acceptance has been extremely positive. We're very proud of it. We're ramping up the consumer advertising here as we move it to Q4. We're very enthusiastic. Obviously consumers will tell, but we're obviously very positive about that. We have a great track record of innovation that we've built over the last several years. Bouncer's. All right. Hostess Francio and E. Calahan. Thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Well, homework helper. Che, they aced their third quarter and boosted its full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,35,2022-11-04 16:08:56
4848," Well homework, helper, Cheg, they aced their third quarter and boosted its full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA as college enrollment begins to stabilize here a little bit more. Cheg's chief financial officer, Andy Brown joins us now. Andy, thanks so much for taking the time and helping us run through the quarter. If you got to think of one catalyst that really sticks out to you within the business from this past period, what is that? Yeah, it's been an interesting 12 months for Cheg and as you had mentioned, things what we're seeing in the headwinds that we saw maybe a year ago have now stabilized. As far as catalyst with respect to Cheg, I mean one of the things that we have been doing is pushing what I'll call offering our premium price option. We call the Cheg Study Pack and we continue to see a great momentum there adding more value to the study pack and more of our students are taking that premium price option and that's had a very nice impact on not just our revenue growth but our earnings and as you saw in our report, we blew through our earnings and we raised our guidance quite significantly. When we think of the past two years, it's really changed the way that a lot of colleges, universities might think about where people can be educated from, how they can be educated, what type of opportunities that create for Cheg even in a Renaissance moment for education or a new normal that we're heading towards? Well, when we came to Cheg, our CEO came 13, 14 years ago, I'm now in my 13th year here, we were a textbook renter but our vision was always that we would offer many types of services online and we used to use the term and continue to use the term that you bet on the inevitable and the inevitable is that more and more things are going to be done online. And so we embarked upon offering subscription services, homework help services that were exactly how students wanted and that is their relatively inexpensive, their online, they're available 24 by 7 and those are the types of services that students expect and we continue to deliver whereas the traditional college experience was all of the help was on campus but that's not the modern student today. I mean, I think a lot of people don't realize is that you may think of a traditional four-year residential school but many students in today's environment are actually part-time students that are commuting into community colleges, they don't have the ability to get help at the institution and so we provide that opportunity to learn anywhere, anytime, any place. And Andy, you guys are also expanding more into things that have nothing to do with traditional students that is college students, right? You're looking more to the corporate world as well. I know you have a partnership that allows companies to give their employees language learning. How big a part of your business is that and how much are you looking to that business for growth? Yeah, so you're talking about our skills platform and we believe for a long period of time that, you know, while most of what we do today or have historically has been academic and we believe skills-based learning will play a much larger role, is playing a much larger role and will continue to play a larger role in the future. So to your point, we have several skills products. One is what we call our thinkful line of services and then more recently language learning with BUSU and we do work with a company called Guild, that then delivers those services to large corporations like Chipotle and Wal-Mart and so forth. And more recently, what we announced on our earnings call that we were going to be including our language skills services through Guild starting in 2023. So we do believe, you know, when you imagine, check, I'll call it two to three years or now, skills will be a much bigger part of our revenue and contribution. And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw feedback from the local wodshef and you could support hiring the user.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,36,2022-11-04 16:13:28
4849," And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw an adjusted EBITDA in the positive. Where is that coming from? How are you guys achieving that? And what are some of your targets on that front? Yeah, so we've always focused on profitable growth. That's always something that we've talked about at our company and as you can see, we continue to do that. We had a nice beat in Q4. But inherently in our model because we've got a fairly fixed content cost and much of our uses come through unpaid sources. It's just natural that as we scale, our margins will scale. And I'll just remind everybody, I mean, we're profitable across every line. It's not just EBITDA, it's not just non-GAP. We're GAP profitable. So we do believe that we'll continue. We're not going to put a cap on where that would be. We're not at a steady state profitability yet. We do believe that as we scale, we will continue to increase our margins. And while we have you, this has been a significant year, perhaps the most significant that I can remember in terms of student loan debt relief and kind of the conversation to advance the cost of college and reforming the high expenses that families and individuals incur. Just from the Cheg Lens, you can give us your read through moving forward from here, where some of these costs can start coming down, given that Cheg was one of those platforms that ultimately can reduce the costs on the book front that were so extensive for a lot of college goers and education seekers. Yeah, so it is painful. And I think this is more of a, it pains me to see college students going to college taking on large debt, but then are unavailable to actually pay it off. And that's what you're seeing. So does that disconnect on the ROI? In many cases, not all cases, but in many cases, the ROI. And I think that is a big part of what as a society we need to fix. What is the ROI of going to college so we don't get into these situations where students fundamentally can't pay that debt off, which is real simple. There isn't an R, there wasn't an ROI on that particular student's education. So I think that's the fix that we need to do. And that still hasn't been accomplished. Andy Brown, thanks so much for being here. Thanks, Cheg's Chief Financial Officer. Checking in on the King.

4851," add dollar menus or kind of entry level ala cart menus. I don't know if dollar is any longer the relevant price point but having an everyday entry level price point product that consumers can go to ala cart and or to bundle I think is an important aspect of being a broad based and very thoughtful restaurant business and that's something that we continue to explore. Look at our teams are working on quality and product offerings at the right price that allow for customers to come in more frequently and enjoy our brands day in and day out. There's two and a half percent net restaurant growth when you think about the franchisees what are you hearing from franchisees right now and even potential franchisees in different markets and how they're potentially looking to get into business with restaurant brands. Yeah we have a lot of excitement around growth in our business and fundamentally restaurant brands and our four amazing iconic brands are growth brands and growth businesses. We've got a lot of room for growth internationally for all four of our brands even Burger King that has north of 12,000 restaurants in international markets. We've got a lot of room for growth we think domestically with firehouse with Popeyes Tim's in the US is beginning to to rev up their engines from a from a growth standpoint and obviously firehouse has a huge runway domestically as well. franchisees are excited they're obviously concerned in near term with the impacts that we're seeing in inflation commodity costs that that's all that translates not only to food costs but also to construction costs. There's there's always a challenge around getting permitting and the process of getting approvals to move forward with new restaurants sites but we have a healthy pipeline we have a lot of interest from existing franchisees as well as new franchisees to develop our brands domestically and internationally and we continue to work with our partners to to move those pipelines along and and continue to grow our businesses and over time we think we're going to we're on our way to our 40,000 restaurant goal with restaurant brands over the next several years. I have 10 seconds left and this is national sandwich day. Somebody's been up in town they've been out there touting their sales gains any any smack talk form. Look our brands are awesome we have firehouse burger king Tim's and Popeyes I think they're the best in each of their categories in burger chicken coffee and and sandwich and I'll let the customers decide who the best brands are. My focus is building a great team working with our franchisees and delivering profitable opportunities for growth across the across our four brands. You're too nice Jose you're too nice. Just too nice. I was there as a customer of Popeyes I can say on this sandwich day that that chicken sandwich is family. Thank you so much for joining us here on the show.

4852," you I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the second question. I'm going to start with the second question. BlueBin are shares or seeing a pop after topping estimate in his latest quarter that stock up nearly 5%. The global automotive technology company reporting revenue of nearly 30% higher from the previous quarter and up 60% year on year. BlueBin are maintaining its full year guidance as it remains on practical chief. 2022 milestones for more on all this we have Lumen R CEO Austin Russell joining us today Austin it's good to talk to you. I'm going to get through the numbers in a bit but I want to point to an announcement that someone argue kind of overshadowed this wrong core that you had. Lumen R's lighter equipment and software now shipping on cars and then you have to do positive movements at a time where there's concerns about where self driving is going. Talk to me about how that's progressing and what that tells you about the timeline for wider adoption. Yeah, no, I think the whole point of what we've done is that really after 10 years of you know innovating, point of type being developing industrialized. I think we're finally making this journey. We're actually making its way out of that whole moonshot R&D phase into production vehicles and it's something that we couldn't be more excited about. But yeah, it's happening. It's coming together. And of course, psych, you know, is the largest Chinese automaker with their they have a new fully electric brand. You know, rising auto with the R7 that we're launching on but that's just the start. Or I showed the one to that on November 9th. And then we also just had pole star. They just introduced the pole star three a couple of weeks ago. Also featuring a woman or so all this is converging and this is just the start, you know, then you don't were say to use a Nissan and other partners that we have. Fantastic. Let's talk about the numbers in the quarter, especially with the cash on hand. You ended the quarter of the year. And then we have a $150 to $200 million a year. It certainly looks like you are on track to reach profitability. Talk to me about the timeline you're looking at right now for the company. So while we're going to be hosting actually a luminar day, you know, come the first quarter of next year. We're going to outline all the details with the guards to our timeline and plans associated with becoming cash flow positive. But I think the key point is that we're going to have a little bit of a little positivity with a strong buffer as well for everything that we want to do for our four business and beyond. So that's that's really good. But and fortunately in a very privileged position when it comes to capital needs and there's huge upfront capital requirements as well that's needed to make this happen in addition to, of course, the technology to people, the resources and partnerships. And so we're generating real business and revenue. This is the first time that this kind of tech is making its way into a series production for these kinds of, you know, next generation safety and autonomous capabilities and having that revenue ultimately is able to be very helpful towards building a viable business. Whereas, you know, the vast majority of autonomous legal related companies are either have a pre revenue or little to no revenue for the foreseeable future. So that's a fundamental thing to be able to make happen in the growth curve with the automakers. And finally, Austin, you pointed to some of the positive steps you're taking in the partnership that you have with car makers, but, you know, we have had some setback in the autonomous trading.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,40,2022-11-04 16:30:46
4853," to some of the positive steps you're taking in the partnership that you have with car makers, but you know we have had some setback in the autonomous driving push. We had Ford and Volkswagen most recently pulling the plug essentially on their self-driving ambitions and I wonder where you think things are headed. I mean was this kind of shakedown inevitable given the technology that needed to get to full autonomous driving and it's sort of the grand vision that was set out years ago in terms of where this is headed. Is that still intact? Um well one the grand vision that I think many gave in the industry is absolutely not intact. But the key distinction here is that that's a completely different world than the kind of stuff that we're doing here at Luminor. The main issue with what we've seen from a broader autonomous vehicle standpoint is that both the vast majority of companies have really been focused around eliminating the driver with all-out robotaxies in urban environments. So the big bet that we made was actually not that at all. It was actually for consumer production vehicles in trucks as well. As an opportunity to be able to improve the safety of the vehicle enhance the driver, not replace the driver altogether. And that's a key distinction here of how this is happening and the rest of it is actually I mean for what it's worth it's not any different than what I was saying a handful of years ago. I think people may just listen more now. But the reality is that that's a 10-year journey. That's a long time frame here too. What we're doing is already starting to make its way into production cars today. It takes years worth of work and advance and a lead-up of what we've had to do to make it happen. But because of the fact that we're focused on safety, we're focused on much more constrained problems here. Getting rid of that you know $100,000 roof rack full of sensors and a supercomputer in the trunk and now having something that can go on to production vehicles as a cleanly integrated system. That's what we think is incredibly powerful and that's why we're seeing all this adoption by all these major automakers. And I think as the industry evolves we're only missing more and more people pivot towards that strategy which ultimately ends up you know just as with that argo case ends up being more synergistic with the stuff that we're doing. Yeah it's certainly been great to track all the progress with Lumenar. Austin Russell, Lumenar CEO appreciate your time today. Thanks so much for joining us. All right we're joining us now for another perspective on the housing market is Bruce McNeilidge. Kimlock Partners co-founder and CEO Bruce thank you for joining us this afternoon. As we're seeing though even though the Fed good to have you even though the Fed raising rates we're seeing the 10-year yield ticking up mortgage that mortgage rates over the 30-year fixed ticking below 7%. Help us understand the correlations here. Sure so the 10-year treasury doesn't necessarily affect the payments of commercial debt and what builders are paying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,41,2022-11-04 16:35:02
4854," Sure, so the 10 year treasury doesn't necessarily affect the payments of commercial debt and what builders are paying, but certainly it's going to affect interest rates for the average person. And right now, actually, the rates as of yesterday were right around 7 and a quarter, and that really hurts the entry level home buyer significantly because they barely can afford a house right now with the cost of housing going up because of supply chain and materials. And as that house goes up in place, it's knocking more and more buyers out of having the ability to purchase a home and they either have to rent a home or stay in the home that they're currently in. Bruce, just what's your assessment on the damage that the Fed has caused in the housing market? And I guess any concern that the Fed is doing too much with what it sounds like more rate hikes on the table? Sure, so it's really going to be a trickle down position where people are not going to be able to buy houses. It's going to hurt mortgage brokers. It's going to hurt bankers. It's going to hurt realtors really hurt people. And I think what what the situation was people were not ready for this. It turned on a dime and really changed significantly more quicker than most people would have expected. So builders are still building houses, but they can't they can't sell houses and that's really putting builders in a position where they have to discount houses. And with the Fed raising things as again as quick as they they have done it's hurting folks in the residential real estate business significantly. And it's going to take them many months if not a year or two to catch up because of what they've done at the Federal Reserve. So then Bruce, this supply and demand balance that the Fed is looking for. How far out do you see that being? So what it's going to do is it's going to not develop as fact because if if banks aren't loaning money to developers or developers are skittish on developing land, that's going to put builders back several years because you have to develop a land before you build the houses. And so during this time builders can't get commercial loans or interest rates are going up for those loans. Same thing with developers, there are problems getting loans. And that's basically going to end up again a year or two, three years in the future. It's going to have a ripple effect because it's going to cost folks money and it's also going to cost folks a lot a lot of time because they have to catch up because of the slowdown in the economy that the Fed is creating. Bruce, we spoke to you about a month ago. You told us that traffic had been falling off just in terms of demand out there. We saw a little bit of relief. I guess it mortgage rates this morning, although not too far below that 7% number there has demand declined even further over the last couple of weeks from your perspective. I'm actually in one of my new houses we just bought from a builder right now and demand has not wane. The demand is still there. The entry level home buyer, the millennial they want to own house. The problem is the houses are without a reach. They might have been saving and looking at paying a three or four percent interest rate and budgeting for that. But now that the rates are up to 7%, it really forces those people that were working hard and saving for a house. It really knocks them out of the market and it's making tougher for all people to afford a house. And unfortunately that has a ripple effect. So then in terms of inventory, obviously people holding on to the good mortgage rates they got before the Fed started raising interest rates. What is this doing for first time home buyers? What sort of options do they actually have right now? Well, if you can qualify for a mortgage, builders are discounted houses significantly. I've seen 10% 15% even 20% discounts to retail pricing for the entry level home buyer to come in, take a look at houses and able to close on houses. The problem is they just can't afford houses and there are too many houses on the ground. So what builders really need right now is more buyers that can qualify for mortgages. The buyers are out there, the demands out there, but just qualifying for mortgage and then affording that higher payment is really a hurdle for the entry level home buyer. Bruce, you mentioned 10, 15, 20% discounts on the table right now. Can we see larger discounts if demand if traffic doesn't pick up here? Well, I think it could be a discount in the form of number of things. They can give you different features in the house, free refrigerator, ceiling fans, credit for furniture, closing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,42,2022-11-04 16:39:20
4855," Well, I think it could be a discount in the form of number of things. They can give you different features in the house, free refrigerator, ceiling fans, credit for furniture, closing costs, credits to get a mortgage and pay the points. And so I think, again, it's a supply and demand thing. We were in the deep south. We were traveling through Atlanta. And one builder has 150 houses on the ground finished that they have no offers on. 150 houses and that's one builder. Imagine a dozen builders. So really the builders are going to have to keep reducing their prices until the supply and demand takes care of their inventory. And then they can certainly level off those prices. But that's going to be a big hit to the bottom line of builders. But again, something's got to give. There's too many houses built and not enough buyers right now that can qualify for mortgages. Yeah, Bruce, I know that you're focused on the southeast region right now. Is this more of a regional story or is this scenario playing out across the country? No, this is a national story. There are just not enough homes for people that want homes. The millennials are now in their 30s. They're looking to start homes and their subdivisions. They're moving out of the urban core and having children. So the demand is there. The problem is, give an example, people save in 401k right now. 401k have become 301k's. So people certainly don't have the money, whether it's in savings, whether it's the stock market going down and retirement plans that they can borrow from. The money's just not there. The demand is there. And that's across the country. Now the southeast and the southwest are certainly areas that have had much higher growth and much higher demand over the years. But it's a it's a problem nationwide. And Bruce, I want to ask you about some of the layoffs that we've seen with Open Door, with Zillow as well. What are your expectations that we know that obviously that we're far from where we were at the peak of the pandemic when the everyone was sort of clawing for houses right now? What are your expectations for layoffs in the retail industry here? So those I buyers will certainly be cutting back. If they don't have enough houses to buy and sell, that certainly is going to lead to layoffs and reduced income for the I buyers. But this can be a trickle down effect. You're talking about real estate agents. All sorts of different companies are going to be laying off people banks, people that do mortgages, process mortgages, cell houses, realtors. They all are going to be squeezed by this. And I think you're going to see a shake out across all the different industries that make up the financial positions that have to all line up for someone to afford house banks are going to be lending less money. And there's going to be a lot of shake out in the banking industry. Certainly a challenging time. All right. Bruce McNeilidge, Kinlock Partners co-founder and CEO. Thanks so much. 30,000 pilots from the nation's largest airlines rejecting contracts this week. Negotiations derailed by the pandemic now growing tens as the industry contends with a pilot shortage of mid escalating costs for more we want to bring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,43,2022-11-04 16:43:47
4856," And rejecting contracts this week negotiations derailed by the pandemic now growing tense as the industry contends with a pilot shortage amid escalating costs. For more, we want to bring in Captain Dennis Tejer, allied pilots association spokesperson. And this union represents 15,000 American Airlines pilots. Dennis, it's great to have you. So let's start with American Airlinesers. And you are representing the 15,000 pilots of that carrier voted against the tentative agreement this week. Why? Well, our leadership actually took what was in place and reviewed it and said it didn't get anywhere near meeting what our membership expect for a contract. And it's not just about the money. There's a market rate for pilots. It's gone up dramatically. Inflation has cut away at our purchasing power. We watch Alaska national carrier versus us as a global carrier, just settle a deal. And importantly, they went up 20 plus percent on their pay rates. But the number one issue for our pilots is work life balance and scheduling practices and the Alaska pilots work with their management team to execute a deal that will not only take care of that need for the pilots, but actually freeze them up to do even more flying and keeps the schedule more reliable. You know, on this program on a financial side, you know what an airline cancels flights. It affects the unit costs because it's less ASM seat available seat miles out there. Right now, American by having all these canceled flights is actually increasing their costs and they haven't even gotten a value out of it if they had actually invested in a pilot contract. So we're going to get this done, but it's not going to be done on the cheap. It's not going to be done with a low level investment because the revenue opportunity out there is unlike anything we've ever seen. Just listen to the quarterly calls every CO saying record revenue and passenger demand like they've never seen before even in the so called shoulder months. So then how many of these issues were already brewing before COVID really put a lot more pressure on pilots and an airline workers as well versus some of the more specific things that are now coming out. So great question. These some of these issues were Fisher cracks within the foundation of operation through management's in attention to that, but the pandemic when they did not keep pilots trained they retired airplanes early and didn't retrain pilots for that. That furloughed pilots had early returbs. I think I might have mentioned that bottom line was they had this wave of pilot training that they never did, which is part of the $54 billion investment promise. That part they're still catching up from so what they've done is they saw the revenue coming in the demand they didn't expect that to come back till 2024. Well, they were an outlier because we saw it coming along with many analysts. So what happened is now they just dumped in ticket sales even Delta admitted they just went for the revenue and they overplayed it. So now they have a system that is not trusted that has been pushed to the edge and the things that they did to try and keep it rolling they continue to try and do that. They schedule us to the maximum with very little buffer and we go illegal flight cancels where they pushes to the point of exhaustion where by FAA law, we cannot fly when we're fatigued and we have to make the right call for safety and actually fatigue off of a flight. These are all undermining the reliability and the revenue stream not to mention the brand damage and it's also pushing on a margin of safety. We're going to defend that margin of safety so no passenger has to worry about that, but we're human and the first thing that goes when you fatigue is your judgment. It's a vicious cycle and it's got to be stopped and some of the answers are in our contract. I can guarantee you that working with us is going to be a lot less expensive than if you work against us because there's revenue to go get out there and we want to help you harvest that. As you said, it's not just about the money in the latest tentative agreement. It did call for 12% raises for pilots on the date of the contract signing plus 5% after 1 year, 2% after 2 years. Were you satisfied with that part of it or do you want a bigger pay increase? Well, that did not satisfy at all. Number one, we got influxible. What would satisfy us is actually recognizing that the entire regional affiliates are smaller airplanes. They got pay raises up into the 80% range. As we're looking for, we know they're deeply behind. You can get paid more working for regional affiliate, the smaller airplanes and you can for mainline. So upside down, we're going to fix.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,44,2022-11-04 16:48:04
4857," 80% range. And that's not what we're looking for. We know they're deeply behind. You can get paid more working for a regional affiliate, the smaller airplanes, and you can for main line. It's upside down. We're going to fix that. The other side of this is that every contract is up for negotiations now. Son Zalaska, who settled, you're not going to be left behind. Do your management team. You're not going to be the outlier. And I got news for you, we will have snapups because we're all negotiating in this narrow band of time. If someone gets a little bit higher pay rate, you're not going to be an outlier by providing that because we are going to have a snapup that brings us there. It's becoming the industry standard. And all this the convergence of the pandemic, the recovery and these contract negotiations make it a very safe and compelling time to negotiate modern deals with pilots. It's going to be a commoditized not only on a pay rate basis, but actual utilization rate. It's all right here, and it's actually going to be good for the industry. We just have to get management to join us so that we can point all of our energy toward making a better product, put more flights out there, which will actually help ease the unit costs. The more ASMG have out there, we get this business and we want to be a part of it in a functional way, but we will not be exploited while management tries to figure out how to modernize their operation. We'll certainly be keeping track of how talks are progressing a big thank you allied pilots association spokesperson Captain Dennis Tager. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, shares of Starbucks trading higher off reporting those fourth quarter earnings there up almost 3% where British securities managing director Nick Setchen joins us to help break those numbers down. Good to have you back, Nick. Now, we know you had a neutral rating on the stock and a price target of $92. What did you like in this earnings report? Well, the US comp is clearly on fire here, including positive transactions. So, you know, the company is able to pass on 10% you know, average check growth and still manage to get 1% positive transactions. That that that's clearly bucking the trying to earn the restaurant industry. And then on top of that, you know, despite the China was the rest of international X China is doing better as well. So the rest of the markets like Japan, South Korea are actually carrying China along, right? I mean, so the consensus estimate for international, including China was down eight came in down around six. So beat on international as well despite China headache. And Nick, that's interesting here because clearly the results are very strong. Once you take out the weakness that we are seeing out of China. But as we enter the next couple of months, which at least from now looks like it's going to be pretty choppy. We could see more of a significant slowdown here in the US where Starbucks clearly outperformed last quarter. What's your read on what we could see this current quarter and looking ahead into next year? Well, so I mean, I expect the guidance to be very positive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,45,2022-11-04 16:52:24
4858," What's your read on what we could see this current quarter and looking ahead into next year? Well, so I mean, I expect the guidance to be very positive, relative to expectations. The question is, despite the guidance, what actual results will look like as the year progresses, in the near term, at least through the first half of their fiscal year, so the holiday season and on fiscal Q1 ending in March or calendar Q1 ending in March, I expect them to continue to have high-singlisher comps in the US, even with negative transactions. So I see very little risk to current expectations around FY 23. And Nick, a lot of people are looking for some cues as to how the consumer is feeling about things. Doesn't seem to be the case though, for Starbucks, even same store sales growth, up 11% people also spending more higher foot traffic. Then what do you think consumers are driven to Starbucks, whereas we're seeing some other retailers really struggling? Well, you know, an interesting thing is restaurants across the board have been doing very well this quarter, not a single restaurant, with the exception of a couple of, you know, company-specific cases has missed so far, with about 85% of restaurants reporting. So every single restaurant, practically every single restaurant has beaten expectations and has given very solid guidance, especially around the top line. And that's being driven number one by an extraordinary price increase, we increase, but even with those big price increases, the gap versus growth rate is expanding. So growth rate prices are seeing higher year growth rates than the restaurants number one. So that's helping restaurants become a relative value as ironic as that sounds. And then two, we're still benefiting, restaurants are still benefiting from this. You know, I don't want to stay home, I want to go out and enjoy experiences as opposed to, you know, ordering goods online. And so restaurants continue to benefit from that tail as well. Nick, what about the price increases over the last 12 months? We've seen prices rise by about 5% do you think more in store? I think more in store, but I do think that because grocery starts, grocery prices are rising faster, restaurants are not in danger as much as, you know, first-plush might indicate. All right, always good to have you on Nick's set to live. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com collaborate on the emerging housing markets index, which considers battle and return on real estate investment, economic health and quality of life. And with the population just over 70,000 Johnson City Tennessee came out on top. Johnson City Mayor Joe Wise with us now on the economy and the housing market. Good to see you, Mr. Mayor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,46,2022-11-04 16:56:45
4859," Since city Tennessee came out on top, Johnson City mayor Joe Wise with us now on the economy and the housing market and good to see you Mr. Mayor and the obvious question is the wagon wheel song by Darius Rucker or number one on the Wall Street Journal emerging markets list. What was a bigger deal there in Johnson City? Well, we've had more time to think about the wagon wheel song, but we certainly find the both the exciting references, I suppose. Mayor, what do you attribute all this excitement to the fact that people are coming from all over the country? It sounds like having interest in your relatively small city. What's driving that? I think there are a number of factors that have contributed to it. We've as a city made a sustained investment in infrastructure and particularly the deployment of direct fiber to every residents and business in our community to provide 10 gig internet. So that makes it a place that people can work remotely in a time when people are contemplating working remotely. But then alongside of those things are quality of life considerations that were home to East Tennessee State University that offers doctoral programs and medicine pharmacy and nursing and physical therapy and many other allied and health science fields. And so with that comes the parallel medical community with a local children's hospital, a level one trauma center. And so folks can come to Johnson City and find in a relatively modest sized town the resources, the services and the quality of life features and amenities that you might associate with significantly larger cities than Johnson City. And Mary, we just had the average price, the median home price in your city up on the screen. Now, $379,000 that's up from $350,000 just three months ago, up significantly on a year over your basis. What do you make of the dynamics that's playing out in the housing market in your city? What we could potentially see to prices here in the coming quarters? Well, that's something we're mindful of every good news has some consequences that may not always be favorable. And so we're aware of the potential risk to affordability and potentially the concerns around the quality of life that might be changed if we had a significant influx. And so as a community and as a city, we're making very deliberate efforts to look at growth management and making sure that when when all the dust settles, the things that made Johnson City desirable as a place to live remain true of Johnson City for those who live here now and those who might live here in the future. How did the pandemic actually boost the economy boost the real estate of your town? Well, I think remote work, you know, we began the process of deploying the 10 gig internet through our local energy authority years ago before we knew there would be a pandemic in 2020. And so really we were readying a capacity for remote workers, particularly long before the culture had an inclination to really be pursuing it the way we've seen over the last several years. And once people returned to office, how do you make sure people stay and don't leave Johnson City? Well, I think part of that is proximity. We're at the crossroads of interstates 26 and 81. We are within about a days drive of virtually everybody in the eastern half of the United States. And so for a lot of professionals, a community like Johnson City provides them the best of both worlds, we're only a few hours from places like Charlotte or Nashville or Atlanta. And so if your job doesn't require you to physically be in a specific location Monday to Friday, which lots of people's jobs do not, this might just be the right fit. Based upon the video I'm seeing, sir, I have got to come visit Johnson City Tennessee Mayor Joe Wise. We'll be against that. We will come see it. Thanks for being with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,47,2022-11-04 17:00:57
4860," who spread it, who are quote unquote super spreaders should be held liable for spreading distance disinformation whether it's about COVID or vaccines or about Sandy Hook. I think journalism is still a really noble profession. The problem is so much of journalism has seeped into commentary. I hope that I'll be seen as somebody you know who did what my father told me my entire life. Do your best and that's what I've done. Hello everyone I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to Influencers and welcome to our guest Katie Kourik a course former host of the Today Show CBS evening news co-founder of Katie Kourik Media and author of the book going there and my former colleague at Yahoo which we'll get to. I'm sure Katie welcome great to see you. Hi Andy great to be here thanks for having me. Of course. Why don't we start out before we talk about the book. I'm curious to know about Katie Kourik Media and what you're up to and what's that all about? Well I love sort of being the boss of me as our kids used to say Andy and about three and a half years ago my husband and I saw that the media landscape was changing dramatically. I actually noticed that over the past decade or so and instead of depending on you know people to give me a job I decided I wanted to be a job creator. I wanted to try my hand at being an entrepreneur and that I thought the brand that I had established over 30 to 40 years in media was as powerful as some of the bigger brands and would be enable me to really personalize the news and view it from my perspective. So we decided to be pan media. We have a newsletter that goes over goes out to well over half a million people with a very high engagement rate. We have a podcast. I'm going to be recruiting other talent to contribute and we already have done that. We have somebody who's our book editor. We have a very vibrant relationship with Bobby Brown also used to be at Yahoo and so we're really establishing a collective of voices and in the meantime I'm also developing documentaries. I have a couple of scripted projects in development. I was an executive producer of a series on Netflix called Unbelievable and I wanted to realize Andy is storytelling has changed dramatically. It's no longer siloed. You can and a dissentral mediation allows you to go direct to consumer just as brands are doing and we now have about 35 people working at the company and really what I'm trying to do we also have a shop that you know has picks of what we think are purpose driven brands and female founded by pop founded LGBTQ plus founded companies that we're supporting and really shining a light on. So it's been really exciting because you know it's hard working for a big lumbering bureaucratic organization at times and I find that I can be much more nimble and I can create content at the drop of the hat a drop of a hat or I can do longer profiles and series and really explore topics I'm interested in that I think are worthy of a listener or reader or viewer's attention. What do you think about TV news right now Katie and you know we're seeing the emergence of streaming services like CNN plus and what does that mean for the industry how would you describe it? Well I think it's just another way to provide interesting content to consumers. You know it'll be interesting to see if people are going to pay for those services when there is so much news.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,48,2022-11-04 17:05:21
4861," You know, it'll be interesting to see if people are going to pay for those services when there is so much news everywhere. I mean, I'm just inundated with with news 24 seven and a lot of it is really high quality. I was just reading a great piece this morning on Joe mansion and the rolling stone that someone brought my attention to. So I think it'll be an interesting experiment to see if people are going to want that content. Well, they want to see Chris Wallace doing interviews. I'm not sure maybe hardcore Chris Wallace fans will but it seems to me that there is so much news. It's so ubiquitous now that they're going to have to provide something that is really unique. And I think they're trying to do that with sort of the model of Anthony Bourdain, which, you know, was established on CNN many years ago with evil on Goria, you know, I just I just don't know at what point I guess is the content overload Andy, you know, is there just so much to choose from will the cream still rise through the top probably but will it be enough to sustain some of these newer business models. I'm not sure. Right, and then ubiquity is both the blessing and the curse from the consumer standpoint because there is so much out there, but then how do you choose. And so I'm sure you're asked this question Katie people asked me all the time, what do you look at what do you read and how do you decide what to look at when there is so much stuff. Well, you know, I do rely primarily on newsletters and on Apple news and, you know, I remember when I was at Yahoo with you Andy, I begged for them to let me start a newsletter that would basically go straight to people's inboxes and help kind of curate the things they needed to know. You know, they they weren't interested in that at Yahoo for a variety of reasons, which we can talk about later and sort of what Yahoo's ultimate business goals were at the time, but, you know, I read a lot of news letters. I try to read the economists I look at time magazine I read the New York Times, the Washington Post, I read various news letters from reporters from those outlets. I read the pointer institute Tom Jones does a media newsletter the Pew Center research center does kind of what's going on in media interested in kind of looking at trends I read the information by Jessica lesson. So I really try to get a good cross section of helpful and useful information and sometimes I just look at Apple news and see what's trending and if there are articles that I'm interested in. And I feel like I really get a good sense of what's going on in the world with the a malgum of sources that I turn to. you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,49,2022-11-04 17:09:36
4862," you you you you today want to with these m water, so important. And I think it, you know, you can't just wave a magic wand. It's, it, there's, there's so many factors, I think, contributing to this imbalance of power that have been entrenched in our society for decades, if not centuries. And so one of the things that I hope we can do is have honest conversations about this. I think that's so imperative. And if my book models that, then that's something I'm really pleased about. Because I think what happens is, you know, there's, there's, there's progress and then there's a backlash. There's progress and then there's a backlash. And I think having open and honest conversations and not, you know, canceling people because they say the wrong thing or not rejecting them out of hand because the way that they see things which and their products of their own environments is a really important component to leveling the playing field for everyone. You write a course about, we talked about Matt Lauer or I mentioned him, I should say in the problems, and let's moon this, are men in TV and entertainment worse than other businesses? Or is it just that they're more high profile? You know, it's hard for me to answer that question Andy because I haven't really been in other businesses. But having said that, I do think they're more high profile. I think there's probably a little more, you know, it's not exactly a low-key or low-profile industry. So I think probably the ego level, men in television in general and sort of media is probably feeds into or fed, excuse me, fed into certain behavior for many, many years. So I think that, you know, I think it was just sort of business as usual. It was sort of the status quo for this kind of behavior. I think it was not only tolerated, but in some cases encouraged in television news, and especially as women were entering.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,50,2022-11-04 17:13:55
4863," not only tolerated, but in some cases encouraged in television news and especially as women were entering that industry and significant numbers. I think we forget that, you know, I graduated from college Andy in 1979 and this was when women were really entering the workplace in big numbers. And so it was male dominated for quite a while. Women were in positions that were dependent on their male bosses. So that created a dynamic that just, I think, opened up for a lot of abuses. That, and add to that kind of the culture that existed. You know, a bit of Hollywood, we're going to make you a star. I control your fate. You are subservient to me. And I think that provided a recipe for that kind of really unacceptable behavior. And then you give them come back or should they be allowed to come back or talk about canceling people and people paying the price. I think a lot of it depends on your response to the allegations. I think people who recognize, I think James Franco did something very interesting that we haven't seen with a lot of these men who had been. I think that I don't know we could have a whole conversation of the word canceled. You know, I think they were removed with cause. You know, I think canceled sometimes suggests that a small. You know, a smaller or or infraction or whatever was overly penalized. So I think James Franco talked about, you know, getting help acknowledging his issues and trying to understand the damage that he did. And I think that other people should probably take a page from that playbook and do some serious introspection and then try to kind of contribute to, you know, be the change they that we hope to see. Instead of kind of digping in in their heels. But, you know, I think I think with any kind of social movement there, there is bound to be some collateral damage. Good, good point about how I use the word canceled, by the way. Well, I mean, I know I appreciate that. No, you are spot on. You know, you are, you are spot on. I want to switch over and get back to some of those tech companies in the platforms a little bit, because they're so powerful. And, you know, you're relying on them. We're relying on them. We're one of them in a way. But Facebook, Twitter. How are you thinking about them, Katie? Are they to blame for the widespread proliferation of misinformation? Should they be held responsible? Should they be broken up? I mean, there are a thousand big questions there, but just your thousand foot take. You know, it's, I wish I were even, you probably are more of an expert on this Andy than I am. I was a co-chair of the Aspen Commission on disinformation. And obviously we took a close look at some of these platforms. I mean, I think the problem with disinformation in our society is very multi-dimensional. But the algorithms and the way things are shared and amplified certainly I think have been, have been fueled by the social media platforms. You know, it's also lack of trust in mainstream media or more traditional media outlets. And also the democratization of information where everyone who has a digital device or iPad or a computer can spread misinformation and disinformation and malinformation. And so I think that we really do need to look, take a close look at the liability of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,51,2022-11-04 17:18:20
4864," And so I think that we really do need to look, take a close look at the liability of some of these platforms that claim they are not a publisher that they're just a platform. And Congress should get involved. I think the federal government needs to have a more unified approach because I don't think there's really a centralized policy arm of the government to deal with this. President Obama says disinformation is the biggest threat to our democracy. Certainly when you look at things like the big lie and the fact that more than 60, you know, courts and judges have said there's no merit to the argument that the election was rigged that it was one of the fairest elections in our history. But the fact that this persists that a huge percentage of the public and particularly the Republican Party continues to believe that the election was rigged. Obviously they're getting this information and it's being reinforced over and over again. And though people gave me a hard time because when I was on Bill Mar, I talked about the need for people to be deprogrammed, which really met just kind of separating themselves from, you know, the information that they're being almost brainwashed to believe through the, you know, repeated serving up of disinformation. I think we need to take a multi-pronged approach and get everyone involved. And I think that people who spread it, who are quote unquote super spreaders, should be held liable for spreading this disinformation, whether it's about COVID or vaccines or about Sandy Hook. And, you know, I think that platforms need to be more aggressive about monitoring it. Of course, the problem and it's not a problem. But the sticky wicked in America is free speech. And how do you balance free speech with the need to have outright lies be, you know, be removed and not not see the light of day. And where unfortunately an audience is receptive to believing them. Yeah, it goes back to the topic is. But it all does go back to can you yell fire in a crowded theater? I mean, it's also timeless. But now it's just this new way of getting the information that sort of, you know, it's a super spreader. And I think the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court said you cannot yell fire. And similarly, you know, I think this is the semantic version of yelling fire in a crowded theater. And, you know, I think, I think the technology has almost outrun the ethical considerations of all this, but it's, it's a really serious problem. I think it's shaping up to even be more serious in 2024. And it's something that, that we need to pay attention to. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,52,2022-11-04 17:22:40
4865," you you you you you I was going to ask you if you would let your kids or tell your kids to get into journalism. But I think one of them is. Yeah. I'm wondering how you feel about that or what you would tell young people are young women and maybe in particular about And there's some amazing high quality, excellent journalism that's being done on a daily basis. So I think journalism is still a really noble profession. The problem is so much of journalism has seeped into commentary. And you know, there's a big argument going on in newsrooms across the country. When should you be an advocate? When should you be a journalist? And is there a way to be both? So, you know, my daughter is working on a documentary about the origin and so the conservative movement and William F. Buckley in particular. And she was an American studies major at Stanford. She is extremely smart. And I think exploring this is really, really interesting and really important. And so I think that we need to have great people attracted to journalism. We need smart, curious young people, men and women. And people who represent this country demographically. So we're talking about people from all kind of socio-economic backgrounds, Andy, people from different, who've had different experiences. Because of their race and ethnicity, we need to be kind of this great American will, you know, by between 44 white people will be in the minority in this country. And we just need to make sure that our journalists represent the people they're serving. Having said that, I do think we need to look at the model of journalism. And I know a lot of people are thinking about this and talking about it. And we need to be restored trust in the media. How can we be less polarized and speak to just one audience or the other? I think that's a really challenging question. But I think it's one that deserves a lot of attention and thought. And I think we need a lot of people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,53,2022-11-04 17:26:53
4866," I think that's a really challenging question, but I think it's one that deserves a lot of attention and thought, and I think we need a lot of people, young people, smart young people, who can maybe look at it and look at it in a different way. And are we forever going to be siloed and have our own information? My friend Nicole Seligman talks about affirmation instead of information. I think these are all big, head-e-medie topics, and we need the greatest minds in the country to focus on them. So I would encourage people, especially idealistic people to go into journalism. Great, we're almost at a time, Katie. So quickly, if you can, what do you see as your legacy? Well, I hope that I contributed to the national conversation and help people understand complicated issues. I hope that I helped show that women were capable, and that it's interesting to think about the fact that in 2006, it was such a big deal to have a woman do the evening news. And now we see the evening news is declining in terms of its influence and importance. They still have a lot of people watching, but much older demographics. And I think very few young people are watching the network evening newscast. But I hope that I helped move the ball a little bit forward for women. Wasn't easy, I write extensively about my experience at CBS. And I think I was met with a lot of resistance there, partially because I think, well, there are a whole lot of reasons which I detail in the book. But I hope that I moved the ball forward for women, whether it was asking that I had a 50-50 division of labor on the today's show with Brian Gumball or took the leap and became the first solo female anchor of an evening newscast. And I also hope that I try to explore important topics and do it honestly. And that I have the vulnerability and humility to say when there were times when I didn't get it right, I don't know any journalists who batted 1,000 for decades. And I think that, you know, I'm proud of myself that I had the courage to say, maybe I could have done something differently or why did I approach a topic this way? Or here were some of the factors that were influencing me when I was making decisions because when all is said and done, journalists are human beings. They're not perfect. They try, I think, to do the best job they can mostly. And so I hope that I'll be seen as somebody, you know, who did what my father told me my entire life, do your best and that's what I've done. And sometimes, you know, it's been great and sometimes I've fallen on my face. But to me, that's kind of a life well lived. And the ability to admit that is, I think, takes a lot of guts.

First let's get to Brad at the Wi-Fi interactive Brad all right Let's take a look at the Dow Jones industrial average kick things off at this the top of the 10 a.m Hour on this Friday congrats you made it to the end of the week here Dow Jones is up by about 1% right now Now as that composite you're seeing that higher by a little more than 1% as well the SCP 500 You're also seeing that hold on to gains by about 1.1% Let's just put this in a five-day context to see how the week is rounding out overall S&P 500 over the past five days still lower by about 3.5% Nasdaq composite that too in the red actually the deepest declineer of the US major averages this week And then additionally you're seeing the Dow Jones industrial average over the past five days still lower But solid movement at least to end out this trading week and that's on the back of today's jobs report Also taking a look first at the sectors now come back to this retail and apparel segment for a hot second in a moment But the sector activity that we're seeing here on the day We've gotten a little more mixed and actually now we have more laggards than Advancers here take a look energy is up 3% here on the day and actually let's put this in an intraday view and now we're in The correct correlation there to today's activity all 11 S&P 500 sectors in positive territory And then just briefly going back to those apparel names that we've been tracking as there's been some fresh news out of Adidas as they've named a new CEO Bjorn golden going to become the CEO of Adidas and so Adidas is up by about 14% right now At least the shares that trade overseas are right now so we'll continue to watch that but moving forward here on the day The US has added 261,000 jobs in October while unionizing efforts continue to make its way through the labor market Starbucks made one of many companies all too familiar with workers unionization efforts. Here's what's the F.O Rachel Regeri had to say on the matter We truly believe a side-by-side relationship with our partner is the very best path forward But we respect the process what we're focused on is continuing to create the very best experience for our partners We know that that has worked for the last 50 years and we're confident It actually underpins the success of our new era of growth. So that's where we're focused And to take a closer look at the labor movement in the US and workers rights We have Mary Kay Henry international president of the service employees International Union. Thank you so much for taking the time here with us this morning First and foremost just got to get your reaction to what you heard from the Starbucks CFO Well, if that was the case Then workers would be at a bargaining table and being able to have a say directly on the job and instead the Starbucks Is choosing to fight tooth and nail closed stores when people unionize and we really Welcome the day when the CFO's comments are the reality with Starbucks because the partners love that company And they want to see at the table and a voice on the job and to be respected protected and paid what they're worth Mary Kay, Julie here. I'm curious if you've ever had an experience where a company has said Come on in. Let's yes, we're happy to have union to your let's negotiate I mean, is it is it much more the norm to have more of an an adversarial relationship? Well, there's been periods in American history where employers have said Come on in when Kaiser Permanente was founded in the 40s in California It opened as a healthcare Provider that all the jobs were union and today they have the highest patient satisfaction and the Employee satisfaction in the healthcare sector Harley Davidson it was a conflict with those workers, but now the United Steel workers and Harley Davidson have a very Good relationship and the company's profitable. So it's true I think what you're saying the norm in the US economy is for corporations to resist Workers who want to join together and we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,55,2022-11-04 17:35:38
4868," is for corporations to resist. Workers who want to join together, and we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that I believe are driving wages up, even though wage growth is slowing, as we have this terrific jobs report this month. And I think that's why we're going to continue to see workers joining together at Starbucks, Amazon, fast food, airports, and across the service and care sector, because people want to turn poverty wage jobs into good jobs that they can raise their families on. Mary Kay, what would getting it right look like for Starbucks? Are you talking $25 an hour and a guaranteed 40 hours a week? Well, getting it right would be recognizing the union at the 250 stores that have already voted to join the union and allowing workers who want to file for elections. The ability to do it without their managers interfering with it or changing their schedules or moving people around stores. The continued anti-union campaign should stop. That would be a way to get it right. And then ultimately, it would be terrific if Starbucks would break with major corporations in the US and do what they do in other countries around the world and set a national bargaining table where there could be a standard as you're suggesting that the workers and the corporation could figure out together. This is in a climate where corporate profits are at an all-time high, highest in 70 years. And so that's why I think the Starbucks and Amazon organizing is connected to the economic health of major corporations here in this country and around the world. And it's why things would go so much better if employers would stop resisting the union and start respecting the right of workers to decide for themselves whether they want to be in a union. Well, it's also driven by the workers' shortage. It's hard to find people to fill those positions. And so we've seen this period of a little bit more of the power being put back in the workers' hands. But that might be about to shift again. If we're heading into a recession, if we are going to see the job market turn around in the next year. So could that also change the dynamics for unions? I actually think what's driving workers to join together in unions is beyond the shortage. And is about the two-year pandemic that people just work their way through and had the experience of their co-workers get hardest hit by the pandemic because people were showing up every day, often without the personal protective equipment they needed. And I think when people continue to work and we're facing life and death choices, I've heard this directly from nurses, retail workers, fast food workers, they've decided that when their employer started to resist them and threaten their job, that was like, okay, if you're going to threaten to fire me, after I just spent two years risking my life to show up to work, then I probably don't need this job. And that's why I'm going to join together with my co-workers and create a collective bargaining agreement so that workers can be respected on the job, protected in their health, and paid what they're worth. Mary Kay Henry, SEIU, International President, good to see you. Have a great weekend. Thank you. All right, the U.S. economy created 261,000 jobs in the month of October. Let's get more of a pulse on the jobs market with U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. Marty, always good to see you here this morning. You're taking these job numbers. I mean, certainly, they're good job numbers with low unemployment. I like seeing that every month. And what was starting to see, I think, is nice as a slow-steady growth in our economy. And I think that we're not getting, certainly, the slowdown that a lot of people want to see or alleging they need to bring the inflationary pressures down. But I think we are sat in the sea slow-steady growth as we move forward here. Do you believe that we'll see more people come back into the workforce, those who have perhaps sat on the sideline for one reason or another, whether that's childcare, or whether that's the coronavirus pandemic and workplace issues, whatever that may be, that they'll start to come back into the workforce. If we do see a deep recession or at least a more pronounced recession. I think we'll definitely see more people go back into the workforce. I mean, there's lots of job openings in the country right now. And, you know, we were talking about that this morning, what I went out of the office in BLS is to see with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,56,2022-11-04 17:40:05
4869," We're back into the workforce. I mean, there's lots of job openings in the country right now and, you know, we're talking about that this morning, what I was, what I went out of the office and BLS is to see where the job openings are and, you know, when you think about job openings, the largest job openings in our country are in lower paying jobs. They're in, you know, hospital, in hospitality industries. And yet, we're starting to see people come back into the workforce and they have higher skills and degrees and they're looking to get into better paying jobs. So right now, as we move forward here, we've got to make sure we're partnering jobs with people and what their ability to do is, and I think that that's something that we have to really think about moving forward. At least that's what I'm thinking about moving forward here at the Department of Labor. Marty, maybe some of those people going to be in these jobs will be laid off software engineers. I don't know because we're hearing about, or people who are looking for job in that sector and there's not that job anymore. We're hearing about a lot of tech companies that are either cutting or freezing hiring right now. There's just a report that Elon Musk now that he owns Twitter is going to cut 3,700 people there. I know that you had talked to Musk in the past regarding his build out in Texas for Tesla. Now he's cutting jobs in his other business and his newly acquired business. I'm just curious what you think about that sort of flow of jobs there. Well, certainly one thing in this jobs report that's not reflected yet in this. Certainly I'm keeping a close eye on that because I dig the tech sector in the United States over the last several years, certainly has grown. Those are good paying jobs and those are jobs that are in lots of cities like Austin, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, out in New York and Chicago, places like that. We have to dive into that a little more. We haven't seen, I don't think a lot of life's here, but there's been lots of talk of layoffs and freezing hiring. So, certainly that's something that would concern me because they have good paying jobs and a lot of states and cities and places around the country have built out expansion of their cities, whether building new housing, things like that. It's for this sector, this tech sector. So it's something that I'm interested in. I'm going to dive more into and certainly offering right now to any tech company out there, anything that we can do at the Department of Labor to help you in a situation. I'd love to do that. As far as Twitter, I mean, that's a whole different situation. I don't know enough about it, but I think that's Elon Musk and looking at the business model. I'm sure at some point that will fix itself out as it moves forward. While we have you, we do know that there's been a move from New York City, this recent, of course, in the salary transparency that's come forward, and regardless of what's started, it's gotten off to. I think there is still this broader recognition that there can be more room for salary transparency that is beneficial to both the employee and the employer. What would you like to see on that front as New York City has already rolled this out, but perhaps where some other cities and states could also have that type of transparency that leads to a more healthy employer, employee relationship and kind of reduces some of the parity issues in pay scale? Yeah. Well, we did that in Boston. When I was in the mayor of Boston, we had 200 companies in the city that gave us the pay data and anonymously were able to dissect it and really work on pay equity and making sure that women and men were paid the same. We made some really good gains in the city of Boston. It wasn't heavy handed. The companies came to the table. These are the large corporations. And I think having these conversations are really important. And coming up with policies moving forward or important, we were successful in the city of Boston. They're still hopefully still doing it in the city of Boston. And now the place is it really is about having these conversations and not just in pay equity and transparency, but also in leadership of companies and getting women on boards and things like that. All of those, you know, those are important aspects of growth and moving forward. You know, legislation has passed often about pay equity. We shouldn't, women shouldn't need legislation to be paid the same as a man. Women should be paid the same as a man for doing the same exact work. And that's something that, not just elected officials, but CEOs of companies should work on. And the way to the time has come to make this make make equity in the workplace consistent. Mr. Secretary, this jobs report just continues a string of really solid to strong labor market reports, but it comes against the backdrop of slowing or declining productivity in this country. I do you think the hustle culture this country was founded on is just done. Yeah. I went up. My name's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,57,2022-11-04 17:44:31
4870," in this country. I do you think the hustle culture, this country was founded on, is just done. Yeah, my economy just went over that with me yesterday and I was trying to get a good reason on how we measure productivity in the United States America. And I think that we're still working through that. I mean, I think the productivity America is strong. I think that when the terminology of quiet quits came up or all of that happening, I never heard it in the communities. I haven't heard it when I was out there talking. I think American workers are still working strong. They're working, getting paid. I've been on a lot of construction sites. I've been in a lot of manufacturing facilities. Those workers aren't slowing down. Those workers are working hard. So I think that, you know, again, I don't know enough about the data. I don't think the data is consistent or strong as it should be to really tell the true story of American workers. All right, we'll leave it there. US Labor Secretary, Mari Walsh, Walsh, always good to see you. Have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. And we'll be right back. Now it's some other headlines that we're watching at this hour. The Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, or PIF, says it will make electric cars in the kingdom under a joint venture with Apple supplier FoxCarn. That's part of a push to build new industries and lessen the nation's dependence on oil. FoxCarn will develop the electrical architecture of the vehicles. And Seer will be the name of the first Saudi automotive brand to produce electric vehicles in Saudi Arabia. The PIF said its cars would be available in 2025. And Seer is projected to contribute $8 million to the Kingdom's GDP by 2034. Chrysler parent Stellantis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,58,2022-11-04 17:48:57
4871," Available in 2025 and CIR is projected to contribute $8 million to the Kingdom's GDP by 2034. Chrysler parent Stellantis warning nearly 300,000 vehicle owners immediately to stop driving their cars after three crash deaths tied to faulty Takata airbagging flaters were reported in the last seven months. The Do Not Drive warning is currently in place for owners of previously recalled 2005 to 2010 Dodge Magnum Station wagon. Dodge Challenger Coops and Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans that had not addressed that airbag issue. And Aldi is doing a Thanksgiving price rewind in an effort to draw customers to its chain amid surging inflation. The grocery retailer lowered prices for its Thanksgiving dinner food items to match 2019 prices. That means discounts of up to 30% for select items. If you recall, we reported earlier this week that Walmart announced a similar pricing strategy, but they're just rolling it back to last year's prices. That would be about a 15% discount. So Aldi saying, no, no, no, no, we're going all the way back to 2019. Hold my turkey. Wait a minute. Something like that. Hold the gravy, whatever. Anyway, it has been a rough year for the semiconductor sector first companies such as AMD and Nvidia could not get enough chips to supply customers. And now slowing PC sales are hurting the industry. Shares of chip makers, they've been sliding all year and it could get worse. So Z is here with his take on this one. Yeah, nothing like dumping this negativity on a day when all the chip stocks are up. And nonetheless, highlighting a good note from cities, Chris Daly, really one of my favorite chip analysts out there on Wall Street. He's offering up some good reasons why the sell-off and chip stocks and the socks index or the Philadelphia semiconductor index might be really ripe for further another sell-off here. First, industrial end market demand is rolling over red flag there as well. Auto sales are in fact cooling. A lot of chips, of course, get used in various automobiles. PC and handset demand are correcting. We've heard that. We have heard that within the past two weeks from the likes of an Intel and an AMD. That PC correction is alive and well and it has been very ugly for a lot of players. And even too, the handset market as well has been correcting as we've learned from Qualcomm's warning yesterday. And then lastly, companies are more tightly managing capital expenditures. It is full on. It continues to be budget planning season in corporate America. And we're starting to see a lot of, I would just say tighter cap X budgets for next year. Maybe that means a fewer less chips. Now of course, there you can see that Philadelphia semiconductor index on the screen right there. That has been, it has not been a good year for that, not a good year for an AMD and Nvidia and many other players in that semiconductor index. Daily things, EPS estimates for chip stocks can tank at least another 20% from where they are now. That would be a big plunge and likely put further pressure to his point on the stocks and that the stocks index could plunge at least 15% as those earnings estimates come down. And my take here in search for bottom, you know, it definitely brings up a couple good points on what would ultimately cause that bottom in chip stocks. For him, it is the end market no longer correcting, valuation just reaching levels that are truly trough and no more cap X cuts. And I'm trying to figure out why I'm in a basket. Is that what that is? I think that's a basket of trash can. It's a trash can. Wow. That's a waste. Wow, that's a waste. That's awesome. That looks like a wicker basket, like a laundry wicker basket. It's a trash can. I feel like I made it. And it's a trash can. It's a trash can. Okay. Well, we'll see what happens with chips. I mean, you know, it depends on the time horizon you look at. Because it's interesting when you talk to some investors and they say the, you know, chips obviously we're still going to meet them. Yes. And so if you're an investor who's looking at five years, ten years, you might have, if you have that luxury, you might have a different sort of assessment here of what this group looks like. Yeah. Look, AMD's business is still growing. Qualcomm is still growing. It's just a matter of, they're not growing at the rates that they were and the growth rates have really, really, really stalled. I think that Qualcomm report was just not good on many accounts this week. Yeah. And signal a lot of things, many of which you pointed out and you're taking today's hours. Appreciate it. Guys coming up, payment platform round up. We're going to break down the earnings from Block and PayPal with BTIG's Mark Palmer.

4872," is Payment platforms block and PayPal. They are on the move today, but in divergent ways. After PayPal cut its full year revenue forecast while block, so a 51% pop in its cash at business year over year. BTIG, managing director Mark Palmer, joins us now. Mark, great to get some of your perspective here on these two fintech names. Now we're seeing the stocks react in very different ways here, but of course the company is saying something very different about what their forecasts may look like. Perhaps we can start with a block. Key takeaways and what was the catalyst kind of going forward for them that is different from PayPal? Yes, thanks very much for having me on today. Block is in a very different position than PayPal. Especially because through its cash app, it is offering a bank account substitute to consumers, particularly in the lower end of the income spectrum, who really benefit from those types of services, especially to time when a lot of banks focusing on their own profitability are growing up the gates and letting less consumers to start bank accounts within their platforms. So it's got a mission critical functionality while at the same time, its seller ecosystem, which is basically allowing points of sale payments, has remained robust, which we believe is largely because the company is offering tools to small businesses and medium-sized businesses that enable them to better manage their payment needs. Mark, it's Julie here. It's good to see you talk to me about cash app versus Venmo because I sort of think of those in the same bucket, although I know cash app sort of has broader applications.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,60,2022-11-04 17:57:36
4873," How is this company going to be able to sustain growth? They're guiding initially to 15% earnings growth in 2023. But at the same time, they're making a lot of statements about the vulnerability of their end consumer to an uncertain macroeconomic environment, thus putting that 15% growth in a very risky position right out of the bat. Mark, you're out here this morning, keeping your buy rating on Coinbase F their earnings last night, but taking your price target to $110 from 220. When will this company live up to its promise? Well, I think that's largely a function of what's going to happen in the end market. Coinbase can and is setting its sales, but it can't control the wind. And the wind in this case is the crypto market, which is very much correlated with risk assets in general. And as the federal reserve continues to tighten, the outlook there is very much uncertain. So what are we seeing? We're seeing Coinbase preserve its optionality by focusing on maintaining a large cash balance, building out its institutional prime brokerage platform, and continuing to add new functionality and areas like staking that are relevant to those in the crypto space. So I think what we are seeing now is a lot of building that's going on, not only in Coinbase, but among Web 3 platforms in general, in anticipation of getting a bit more of a tailwind so that you can see the full realization of the platform's potential. BTIG, managing director, Mark Palmer, always good to see you. Have a good weekend. It's a talk to you. Coming up, what's on tap for Disney's earnings next week?

4874," Shares of Corona are getting run over after posting a wireland expected loss for the third quarter. I mean, it's softening demand for pre-owned vehicles. Prosper mating joins us now. Pros, not a good quarter from Carvana, but again, more pressure on the shares here. Yeah, it seems like these high rates are really hurting there. You know, most people with vine ants, there's their cars, 40 million Americans buy used cars every year. Carvana, I'm going to tell you about how this is a rate-sensitive kind of purchase. Like he said, big mists on the top and bottom line. Gross proper vehicle down a thousand bucks, Euro-earned. That's a lot of, that's a huge kind of like decrease in your profit margin there. So, you know, they said things would get worse for them to get any better. So there's not much there for them to kind of like, hopefully hang their head on soon. But, and then in dice going to cake is they suspended their guidance, right? So they can't kind of see what's, what's next given how uncertain things are. So, you know, the Carvana business model has been hurting all year, right? As we've sort of seen things kind of slow down, rates go up. And the question is, is this rock bottom? And then are they going to kind of like, you know, it's a good product, right? It's a really easy thing people like buying their cars online. So it's like, it's got value that the question is, can they make it a profitable venture? We also saw some news this morning that Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, they're selling shares of a China-based EV maker. So can you tell us more about that? So many years ago, B-Widey, Berkshire bought a pretty significant stake in B-Widey by 20%. They've held on for about 10 years and they started selling little slivers of it, starting late this summer. This is the third, I believe third sale they've done. Another, I think I believe another 3 million shares here. They sold about a million and a half also in September. So it's still, they sell over 200 million shares. So it's still like a significant kind of holding. But the question is, is Warren ready to kind of exit this? If they made a lot of money off this stake, they bought it for 225 million, I think 10 years ago. And now it's over 10 years ago, and now it's worth 7 million, I think. So the question is, when is it time to exit? Does it see it as a long-term Buffett player? Or is it time to sort of like reevaluate? Interesting. We saw those shares rallying just now along with other Chinese stocks during the session. So interesting. Thanks, Frost. Appreciate it. And also looking ahead to the Walt Disney Company next week, it's set to report earnings. We see the shares up about 1.5% or so today. There is a lot going on when it comes to Disney from the parks around the world. Remember, we just had reports of Shanghai Disney being shut for a bit because of COVID there to the streaming landscape here in the US a lot to consider. And considering all of it, is our Alexander Canal who's here with us and said, hey, Ali, so what's the sort of big picture numbers you're going to be looking for? Well, clearly we learned a lot from Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount. And it comes to the state of the market right now, obviously the weakening ad market impacting their bottom line. I expect that to happen to Disney a little bit, but this company has a lot of levers to pull. I spoke with Tim Nolan from a choir. He reiterated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% year to date, but he did note that over the long term, this company has a lot to look forward to. What you're looking on your screen now is a Wall Street projections. We have a new expected to come in at 21.27 billion, adjust the DPS of 51 cents, parks, experiences and consumer products revenue at 7.59 billion. But a really important number is that operating income. 1.9 billion is expectation. That's less than what we saw in the third quarter, but we could see a little bit of an impact from Hurricane E in there. Perhaps some of that Shanghai Disney closures. And then those Disney plus subscribers expected to come in at 9.35 million. Now what Nolan told me to watch is that direct to consumer subscriber figure. Like I said, 9.5 million expected along with that ad tier expectation. How will that add to the company's bottom line? Nolan estimated that ad revenues could surge up to 800 million in 2023. Thanks to Disney plus, that's sort of the overall market opportunity there. And then on the park side, you want to make sure that gross bookings aren't going down that there's no recessionary impact. The analyst pointed out that in 2009, the last financial crisis, park revenue fell 7%. But there's a bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases to prices, updates to the park, the Disney plus app, etc. And then finally, the impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,62,2022-11-04 18:09:26
4875," A bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases, to prices, updates to the park, the Genie Plus app, etc. And then finally, the impact of that advertising slowdown. ESPN I think is pretty insulated from all of that. But ESPN and other big question, right? Looking forward to the company, what's the DTC future of this? Because right now it's clearly more profitable in a linear world than it is in an OTT world. But something that Bob Chapich will have to think about as well. I think there's too much optimism around Disney Plus coming into the report. And keep in mind, this comes against a back to it. Look, we heard from Roku this week. A major slowdown in their business. Netflix, probably some squishy areas in its quarter as well. Power Round Plus, now looking potentially lay people off. It hasn't been a good looking streaming. Hasn't been a good looking streaming. But Disney is not just a streaming company, right? They have a lot of different components to the business. And there's a lot of confidence that they can enter this new world and be very successful at it. If you think about advertising, Disney has a really good base in this. They've really crushed it with Hulu. They have the experience on the linear side. Unfortunately, that adds slowdown. There's not what you can do with that, right? There will be some overhang there. We'll cloud the outlook overall. But overall, I think they're in a good position. They made a lot of investments to Disney Plus. We have a lot of exclusive content that's coming to that service, disenchanted, one of the ones that I'm very excited about that's coming. And I think that content spend is going to slow down significantly over the next few quarters in the next few years. And that's going to positively impact Ipa Tess. So a lot of macro concerns, but I think for this company, they're in a really solid position moving forward. And also with Disney, there's the consideration that on the streaming side too, we could see some more focus around ad tiers at a time where Netflix is rolling out and pulled forward the timeline for themselves to launch that. And so now that we've started to see that pop up in the market and perhaps see what some reception looks like. How have the early days been for Netflix? Well, Netflix just launched their ad here in the US. Yesterday, a $6.99 price point slightly below Disney Plus' upcoming ad supported tier at $7.99. It's going to be a wait and see approach. We're not going to have all the answers this quarter. I think it's going to take a few quarters. So we can really see that impact. I do think across the board, streamers have been exploring price increases. Warner Brothers Discovery on the earnings call last night. They actually pushed up the timeline for that combo service between HBO Max and Discovery to the spring. They said there's a lot of options with pricing sort of hinted that price increases will be coming there. And so pricing is something to really focus on when we think about all of these streaming giants. And I think that's a big component that's going to be important in the quarters to come. Looking forward to Disney. Thanks. So I want to get it. I appreciate it. Coming up, we're going to check in on the state of the restaurant industry and small business. We'll see you at Stockware Company. Lightspeed. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,63,2022-11-04 18:13:55
4876," this So if we're coming to light speed, took a hit this quarter from macro forces, including reduced customer spend at businesses and 4X swing, sitting transaction revenue. But with light speed banking on a move up market, after seeing increased spend, can't it close the sale. The shares are hired today after something yesterday following the numbers and joining us with more is JP Chavez. He is light speed chief executive officer. JP, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. What are you seeing amongst your clients? And we should tell viewers clients are restaurants, but other types of smaller side businesses as well. What are you hearing from them right now? Yeah, so the majority of our customers are restaurants, yours and retailers in the SMB space. And really what we're hearing from them, it's a unique moment in time. The post pandemic world with returned physical has created much more complexity for their businesses because you have the physical world meets the digital world. And also what we're seeing is that it's a cost of labor is gone up, scarcity in terms of trying to hire people and now alluming recession. So it's a really difficult time for our customers and for the market. And here the only way forward for our customers is to adopt technologies like cars that can help them do more with less and automate a lot of the manual tasks. And are they convinced of that, JP? Because as I mentioned, you all had a pretty tough quarter last quarter. You're not just selling software technology to folks. You're also selling hardware in the form of a point of sale system. And are you seeing people retrench or is it just a matter of seeing slower growth? No, so it depends what you call slower growth. We had a 38% growth the year over year. And if you look at the segment of the customers above $500,000, there was 25% growth in store count and above a million dollars, we had a 30% growth. So we are a strong growth player. On what we can control, it was a really good quarter. We beat on also an EBITDA and we beat on the outlook. So for us, it was a very good quarter. What hurt us is what we are planning for in the future. We think there will be a bit of softness, not in terms of our customers and demands, but in terms of the GMV of our customers. And because we are rewarded as a percentage of their revenues, of course, that's going to impact. But still, we are planning very strong growth for the second half of the year. What is the most difficult thing about operating through this particular environment from the CEO perspective? Yeah, well, I mean, this short term versus long term. But light speed, we are a great business, we're building a business that's going to last forever. And then you have the daily fluctuations, investor feelings. But I think for us, the way we look at it, we've outlined the plan, we're ahead of this plan, and we're doing really well. Now there are things we can't control. A currency exchange rates, we do 40% of our business outside of the US. And then the other thing we can't control is consumer buying. But on what we can control, this has been a really good quarter and the business is doing really well. So, IPF, have you followed your colleagues, excuse me, appears in tech and implemented hiring freezes or layoffs? Well, most of the companies that are hiring...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,64,2022-11-04 18:18:19
4877," J.P., have you followed your colleagues, excuse me, appears in tech and implemented hiring freezes or layoffs? Well, most of the companies that are hiring freezes or doing these are not companies that are growing the way we are. These are companies that were pure digital. Light speed, the majority of our businesses have physical presences and as you know, the markets or the consumers have returned to shopping and dining in person. So we are a strong growth story. So we are actually looking today for, I think we have 360 positions open on our website because the company is going to be growing. Now this being said, we have a path to profitability. Next fiscal year, we want to be evict that positive and we plan on doing that, but we have to hire enough people to sustain the growth that we are currently having. And J.P., I'm curious what you're hearing from your clients on the hiring front as well. As you mentioned, restaurants, small retailers, etc. We just got the jobs report today that show they're still growth in things like hospitality jobs, for example. It has gotten easier for these businesses to find people to hire. And that is actually the biggest issue in our industry is that it's very difficult to hire people right now. Most of the people who are working in the hospitality and the retail space found out their jobs during COVID and left the industry and they're having a hard time getting them back into the industry. I think that's really what's hurting our customers right now. And that's why we think it's probably a moment in time and a unique moment in time for light speed because the only way out for our customers because they can't hire enough people is to have platforms that help them automate. And unfortunately for the market, the majority of the systems out there right now are legacy platforms that are really not really efficient in terms of helping them operate in this environment. Have you seen in the data that you're able to kind of glean insights into for all of the businesses that leverage your platform or leverage your service that there is any major pullback or shift at least in the way that businesses are being able to conduct different services whether that be on the food front or whether that be on wherever the platform may be. If the consumers are actually pulling back on their spend or shifting dramatically how they're spending. So for now we haven't well we've seen the big shift we've seen with consumers because we do have also delivery platforms and we also connect with all of the order ahead platforms. What we have seen very clearly is from the end of the pandemic to today there's a very there's a massive return into physical. So that means our customers are selling more and more in their physical spaces. So I think and that's really the complexity right now is that the consumers are still consuming online. They're still using delivery and order ahead but they're also consuming in the physical space which means that for the customers it's more difficult than ever to manage these. And so you often see it you know when you go into restaurants and they have four or five iPads and each of every iPad is for you know different delivery network or and that's where we can help them we can go in and integrate those platforms and make it much simpler for them to run their businesses. So we have seen this big shift and then on a on a consumer basis what we've seen is summer was very strong for hospitality. We've seen a lot of people just return to restaurants and we're starting to see a slight slowdown in terms of of consuming but we are still you know in very healthy healthy volumes. JP JP great to have you here with us this morning JP Showway who is the light speed chief executive officer here with us on Yahu Finance appreciate the time. Thanks for having me.

4878," אך collaborator..... Thank you. You You Welcome back. It's time for time and today we focus in on three separate earnings reports. One minute each. Let's start with this on the day. Shares of Funko ticker symbol FNK. Oh, it's down bad right now after missing. Yeah. Oh my gosh indeed. Missing on profit estimates and slashing guidance, reducing their profit forecast ahead of the holidays. Shares moving in a manner that would make everyone bobble their head. As we're taking a look at the activity on the day, it's down by 50% here. Shrug? Stunning. It's not, you know, I don't think the demand met the company's expectations. We should also note that J.P. Morgan now downgrading the stock. I guess that would happen when your stock loses 50%. But they are implementing a lot of new, I think, just processes and machines and technology inside the company to set their foundation for whatever they're looking to do. But this is a massive, massive day of value destruction for Funko. It seems like it's not as much the sales that are a problem. It's the profitability that's the problem. The EPS and EBITDA really had a big miss here. And the company is now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin in high single digits for the full year. Previous guidance was around 14.6%. If you look at the midpoint, so that's a big downgrade. Virgin Galactic, we're watching those shares as well. They're up 6% after reporting a wider than expected loss for the third quarter. It did top revenue projections. And most importantly, reaffirmed. It remains on track to launch space tourism services in the second quarter of 2023. And it's going to have its commercial spacecraft going up in the middle of next year. I mean, earning shmurnings for this thing. It doesn't obviously make any money yet. But it's all about the timeline here going forward. So that sort of confirmation is encouraging. No, you're making face problems. So it's going to take its space. It's going to take its to go into sub-oantorecession. Right into recession. Like my goodness. And it's economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,66,2022-11-04 18:26:39

It's really been Turn around story that they've needed to initiate from Exploring bankruptcy all the way to okay. How do we just make sure that with any titles that make it into our theater? We're able to stave off competition at the same time making sure that you are able to have enough employees to operate this I think I think for the experiences that I've had in the theater this year You could do it without a lot of employees and I hate to say that but it is become so streamlined from the point of purchasing Digitally to showing up watching the movie and then dip in yeah, well the company's just a debita is improving and beat estimates So that's helping matters as well kind of speaking to your point about maybe cutting some costs here The company said August and September were challenged by a dip in content availability That's come for not a lot of good movies out there I guess but anyway, so we're watching that all right.

4880," Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11 a.m. on the East Coast. Say it out here in the West. I'm Akiko Fujita. Happy Friday to all of you. Here's what I'm watching this hour. Mixed signals in the labor market. The US has 261,000 jobs in October, blowing past expectations. But the unemployment rate ticks higher to 3.7%. Those hot numbers signaling the fed will continue to raise rates a little longer. Layoffs at Twitter, thousands of Twitter employees bracing for news this morning. They may be out of a job. It's all part of a new owner and CEO Elon Musk's plan to revamp the social media giant. We're going to have all the details for you coming up. And it is a big morning for DoorDash shares are surging after a big third quarter earnings beat. We're going to break down the numbers for you. But first let's look at the check of the markets. We are 90 minutes into the trading day. And take a look at how stocks are. Resonance responding to that strong with unexpected jobs report. The down now up more than 500 points. The S&P 500 up 60 in the Nasdaq up 150. All the major averages, those still on track to close out the week in the red. With the Nasdaq seeing the steepest losses up today. But it is down on the week. And despite what we're seeing today, the tech heavy index on pace for its more weekly losses January of this year. We are beginning this morning though with that all important jobs number. 261,000 jobs added to the U.S. economy as unemployment rose to 3.7% in October. Now, as we said, that's a bit of a mixed report coming just days ahead of the midterm elections. Where Democrats are struggling to convince voters. They can get the job done on the economy. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Rick Newman. It's interesting because we've been talking so much about these job numbers as in good news and not necessarily good news for the markets. Today the markets are up. But if you think about where President Biden has positioned himself, especially going into the midterms, is this good news for the Democrats? I can't tell, honestly. But let's start with the headline number. 261,000 new jobs. I mean, the strength in the job market is astonishing. Economists keep saying we expect the labor market to slow down. We expect job growth to slow down. And it keeps not slowing down. Now, we are not adding jobs at the pace we were doing right after the COVID downturn when suddenly every employer had to catch up. But in a normal economy, in a decently growing economy, if you had just 200,000 new jobs per month, that would be a terrific pace of growth. And we've had far more than that all year long. And the slow down just keeps not coming. And yet I'm looking at all these analyses today. And everybody's disappointed. Everybody was hoping that there would be clearer signs of a slowing job market. And why is that? Because everybody wants the Fed to stop raising interest rates. And in order to do that, the Fed needs to see signs that a recession is coming, that job gains are slowing, that wage gains are slowing. So, you know, it's great that we're adding all these new jobs. And it's unfortunate that everybody is disappointed about that. I mean, with that said, Rick, you know, what does this mean in terms of messaging in the final days leading up to the midterms? We've heard the president go out and say, look, the economy is still strong. But voters are looking at where inflation is and saying, yep, how do you look at both in contact? Biden cannot win on the, he cannot win this messaging battle. He has had a strong labor market to brag about all year long. And it hasn't worked. And it just tells you how pervasive inflation is. And it tells you how ruinous inflation is for family budgets. I mean, I just did some new analysis this week. And one of the ironies here is that even though inflation is improving, the rate of inflation has declined from a high of 9% down to, it's now 8.2%. People are actually saying, giving signs that they are getting more worried about inflation, not less worried. And I think for a couple of reasons. Number one, the longer it lasts, the longer people think it's going to last. So inflation expectations for the next six to 12 months are very high. People think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,68,2022-11-04 18:35:23
4881," And I think for a couple of reasons, number one, the longer it lasts, the longer people think it's going to last. So inflation expectations for the next six to 12 months are very high. People think price, these price hikes are going to stay. And I think another thing that's happening is the longer people have to deal with inflation, the more it streams their family budget. So we got the wage and number today, average hour learning, 4.7%, ordinarily, that would be great. But with inflation at 8.2%, your paycheck buys less. People are literally falling behind and the longer that goes on, the worse it is for the incumbent Democrats. So it looks like Biden and his fellow Democrats are going to lose at least one chamber of Congress next week. I think the only question is, are the polls accurate? If the polls are accurate, then it's going to be a bad night for Democrats. So if Democrats are hoping for anything at all at this point, it's at the polls are wrong. And really quickly, Rick, for the Republicans out of things, they've certainly seen strength in the economy, at least that they see that things, at least voters are not necessarily optimistic about where the economy is headed. That's positive for the Republicans. They look at the jobs number today. How do you think they spend this one? They are there. It's the same way they've been spitting it. They just keep pointing to inflation. And that's all they need to do. So I don't think you're going to hear any Democrats saying much, excuse me, Republicans saying much at all about the labor market. They're just going to keep saying Americans cannot afford the basics. And they're not wrong about that. Yeah, just hammering home the word inflation seems to be working for the Republicans so far. Rick Newman has always thanks so much for that. She agreed. For deeper insight, look on what the latest jobs data means for the Fed and the U.S. economy. Let's get right to ADP chief economist, Nila Richardson. Nila's Rick said, when you think about the tight labor market, that has really been one of the biggest hurdles for the Fed and its attempt to cool off the economy. What are the numbers today tell you about how much more the Fed needs to do to get it where they want it to be? Hi, great to be with you. Look, the Fed may not be able to go through the labor market to get to lower inflation. I think that's what the numbers tell us today. We're seeing really steady and robust job gains. The BLS report today was pretty broad base. Little different than what the ADP numbers showed earlier this week in terms of the broadness of the hiring, but in terms of the number of jobs created, we showed 239,000 private sector jobs. BLS, it was 230, so you're seeing the same kind of alignment when it comes to these monthly job gains. For the Fed, that means that it's not the labor market that's seeing weakness. It's things like housing and maybe stocks, but not the stock market today. So they have their work cut out for them. Yeah, it's been interesting to see the reaction and the past we've sourcing the strong jobs numbers kind of lead to declines in the broader market. What, you put this in context for us right now because you said, look, it's not necessarily the labor market that the Fed has to deal with. It's other areas like housing. Are there other levers that you think the central bank can be pulling when you consider that the rate hikes they've implemented so far haven't necessarily led to a significant cooling off of the labor market? The Fed has fundamentally won that that's rate hikes. Unfortunately, they can go faster, they can go slower, but they're still going to hike rates. I think what we are anticipating, at least I am, is that not just that they hike, but that they hike and they stay at an elevated federal funds rate where it's a period of time to bring back inflation. The bottom line is when you look at the labor market, when you look at consumer spending, this is a long game for the Fed. It is not a short game. And that means that rates are likely to stay higher for longer than was originally anticipated by the Fed. wage gain certainly something we've been keeping a watch on as we know so many companies have had to deal with the higher cost that have come with a very tight labor market. hourly earnings up 0.4% in October for the previous month. We are seeing a slight cooling down if you can call it that, but what are you hearing from employers who are saying, look, we can't necessarily fill the jobs, but maybe we don't necessarily have to dangle the same incentives we did six months ago. Well, 80 p pace 1 instance six workers in the United States. We have a lot of payroll data. When we look at pay growth, what we're saying is exactly what you see in this BLS report. So what were our food products?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,69,2022-11-04 18:39:52
4882," case one and since six workers in the United States. We have a lot of payroll data. When we look at pay growth, what we're seeing is exactly what you see in this BLS report. It's exactly what Powell pointed to in this press release that wage growth is slowing, but it's slowing to and stabilizing at an elevated level. It's still much higher than it was this time last year. So wages are not likely pushing up inflation, but it makes key inflation prolonged at the current level. And what we're hearing from our clients, especially our small business clients, is that it's still a tough time finding qualified workers, especially in consumer facing industries like restaurants, leisure and hotel accommodations. And so there's still a struggle here for the smaller firms who were out competed by larger firms earlier on in the recovery. Now is their chance to hire some of these larger firms take a pause. It's been a situation of good news, sometimes doing bad news in this report specifically. I guess the bad news that could be good news is that unemployment did tick a little higher. We're talking about 3.7%, which is still historically pretty low. I mean, how much higher do you think that number needs to go in order to see a real cooling up? Well, I focus on the real economy on the jobs market. So good jobs numbers are good news always. And I think the unemployment number, we have to put it in context. It's still below four percent. It's still at historical lows. That number is coming from the household survey, which is a little less reliable. That number, the 3.7% is likely going to take up back and forth over the next couple of months. But the punchline here is that we're still seeing job gains. And if you match that data to the initial jobless claims numbers that are still around pre-pandemic levels, we're not seeing a lot of firms starting to lay off in mass. And that's good news for Main Street. Main Street is the bulk of the economy. So that's good news for economic growth. Yeah, a lot of the layoff news largely focused on places like tech. We did here, but hiring freezes in places like Amazon as well as Lyft. But we'll continue to watch that. Neelette's good to have you on today. Neelah Richardson, ADP Chief Economist. And here to take a closer look at the market action falling to a stronger than expected jobs data. We've got Yahoo Finance's Jared Blicchery standing by. And Jared, this is a big pop that we're seeing on the back of a strong jobs number. Yes, we are. And it's somewhat reminiscent to me of that big pop we got after the last CPI report, which should have been bearish by all accounts because it was coming in pretty hot. But guess what? The market is reacting pretty strongly. S&P 500 up over 1.25%. And the Dow is really outperforming. Let me just put a five-day chart here and we can see the Dow is still down about 1.25% for the week. But it has come back to the mid-range of that five-day range. Nasdaq still hovering down below. And boy, it has been a story of two different markets here when you consider tech and the value trade that's more heavily represented by the S&P 500 in the Dow. So here's the S&P 500. We're just kind of chopping around down here. 3,900, excuse me, 3,900, which is right here, is a huge level. And also this breakdown region from the Fed the other day, 3,800, also going to be big as kind of where we stop today. But all in all, I think investors will take this, especially after the carnage that they suffered just a few days ago at the hands of Paul Enkel. By the way, today, materials in the forefront, that's a story about China potentially re-opening, along with consumer discretionary financials, energy staples, and industrials, nice mix to see there, Akiko. And finally, Jared, we're seeing a pretty broad-based gains today in the market. But want to hone in on the energy space here. Oil, seeing a big pop today. We got that news from G7 countries that they had agreed to how exactly this Russian oil price cap would be implemented. And what more can you tell us about how exactly this is likely this way in terms of where oil prices are likely to move? Sure. The thinking now is that it's going to be a fixed price limit instead of one that varies with the price of oil. The number that I've seen floating around is $60 per barrel. You can see WTI here, which trades pretty closely to Brent Crude. That's up 4% today. I think that's more on the reports that we're getting a possible re-opening of China based on—",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,70,2022-11-04 18:44:19
4883," pretty closely to Brent Crude. That's up 4% today. I think that's more on the reports that we're getting a possible reopening of China based on the fact that they may be rescinding the Zero COVID, or at least revising that policy here today, but there is that European, I guess, ban sanctions that go into effect on December 5th. So this is ahead of that. I don't think it's going to be a huge deal for the oil market. I think it's going to come down to the demand characteristics and especially with these marginal swings that we've seen with respect to China, maybe a few other places. But you look at the broad complex and commodity is say a lot of green, a lot of dark green, and guess what, we're also seeing the US dollar come down appreciably, particularly against the Renminbi over in China. Yeah, a lot of countries looking at that and saying there's some relief and slight potentially a Jared Vlickery. Thanks so much for that. Let's take a look at shares of Funko, failing to get the topics looking for after disappointing earnings. That stock is down. More than 50 percent. That's right. The company behind the collectible figurines reported earnings of $0.28 a share in revenue of $365.6 million. That was higher than the street expected, but weak guidance for the all-important holiday season spent shares plummeting. The company now expects holiday growth and profit to remain relatively flat from the same period last year that prompted JP Morgan to downgrade the stock from overweight to neutral, the firm slashing Funko's price target in half to $16 a share. Well, coming up on the other side Starbucks credits customers adding more stuff like Syrups to their coffee for its earnings beat. Yeah, that trend continue. We'll talk to an analyst after the short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,71,2022-11-04 18:48:37
4884," One investor is giving shares of Starbucks a big jolt in this session today. That stock is up nearly 10%. The coffee chain posted a record quarter attributing its success to rising prices, even despite some economic headlines. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Brooke Dupalma, who's all over the numbers for us. And Brooke, you know, the good news is domestically, there are consumers who are spending more per visit. But there's some headwinds over these. We'll get to that. But let's start on the domestics of the positive news first. Yeah, Kiko, what's positive news here is that although McDonald's, those Starbucks does not have a jingle like McDonald's Starbucks and Wall Street are certainly singing to the tune of this fiscal fourth quarter report Wall Street. Here today Starbucks having the best day since May shares up nearly 10% in two hours into trading day here. Now, as you noted here, despite them setting higher prices in Q3, they did give us a bit of an estimate there that they raised them a 5% over the past 12 months. But that actually did lead to higher revenue here, record $8.4 billion. Here in the US, seems to be sales jumped by 11%. Thanks to a 10% increase in average ticket price. But just how long will that momentum continue? And can customers expect another price hike? Starbucks, if a Rachel's Ariel, wait in this morning with Yahoo Finance. Really in response to inflationary pressures. We'll have some of that this year based on annualization from moves we made last year. But we expect our pricing to return to actions that are more on a historical level. What we focus on is really how do we sustain that ticket? Because it isn't just pricing. It's actually volume as well. We've seen our customers purchase more. That's evidence didn't you in a tax increase to tax. So we're seeing increased volume. Now some of those offerings of what they consider that are driving volumes include customization here about 60% of beverages are now customized. Modifiers have grown in double digits. And that's includes stuff like pumpkin spice syrup or pepper mocha. Serbs going into your coffee. But Rachel continued to emphasize is that the partners and as you noted, labor inflation certainly coming into consideration here driving this demand that Starbucks is willing to fill also Rachel emphasized that they continue to believe that aside by side relationship with partners is most important in this organization efforts continuum. Side note, Brooke, it looks like you and Rachel are wearing the same top. I didn't know yet. I don't have the same color. I was going to give her drink. They played were doing. We were talking about China because we did see a double digit decline in same source sales there. There's been some rumors floating around this week that potentially China could ease at zero. COVID policy. What more did we hear from Starbucks about what that's likely to mean for their second largest market? Yeah. Well, like so many US consumer brands, Starbucks is certainly hoping and weighing and ultimately, you know, super bullish on the fact that this COVID-19 zero policy will be lifted soon. Starbucks really taking a leader position here, ultimately weighing in and continuing to grow. Now there's nearly 6,000 stores opening up in China and Rachel emphasized that they're actually moving towards digital there in the midst of mobility, not being back to where it was pre pandemic. She said that 44% of the overall sales are digital now. And then once mobility lifts, they expect those stores to operate and continue to grow. Howard Schultz also see where opposite the key are he strongly believes that they will come out of this pandemic as the number one Western consumer brand. So certainly something that's keeping eye on and will continue to follow how exactly that performs on Wall Street. Yeah, certainly been a key market for Starbucks for a very long time. Brooke, thanks so much for that. Let's give the conversation going on Starbucks. We've got Sarah Senator, Bank of America, Senior Restaurant Analyst. Sarah, let me just start with your takeaways from the numbers that we got. A bit of a mixed result. I mean, positive things are moving in the right direction, but still some headwinds abroad. Yeah, I would say more positive than negative. So from the perspective of the US, you know, certainly one of the, if not the best, same store sales numbers, we've seen come out of the earnings season this quarter. The fact that they had 10 points of check is certainly a reflection on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,72,2022-11-04 18:52:44
4885," 10 points of check is certainly a reflection on, you know, as earlier we said, people adding food, people customizing, but also, you know, they said they did have positive transactions, which is a real rarity in this operating environment right now. So that combination was really, I think, very unique and a testament to how strong the brand is and the affinity that customers have, you know, outside of the US, very, very strong results with the exception of course of China, where we know lockdowns led to really intense mobility constraints. But even there, the same source sales were better than people had anticipated. So really recovering very nicely when some of these restrictions are lifted. And again, I think a reflection of how strong the brand is and the ability start of access to connect with consumers in that market and is well positioned as when the lockdown restrictions ultimately are lifted. You know, Starbucks are only not unique in raising some of their prices. We have seen so many food restaurants, you know, really try to make up for the additional costs they're having to pay for. But I wonder how much more pricing power you think Starbucks has? Well, I think you make a very good point there, which is that Starbucks is not unique. And in fact, Starbucks has actually taken less price or, you know, smaller price increases your rear than most in the industry. So if you look at the, you know, consumer price index for food away from home, which is restaurants, you see that that's up, you know, eight, nine percent. I think about seven and a half, eight percent year to date more recently. If you look at some of the other restaurants in the industry who have reported six, five, six percent, which is what Starbucks says on their menu, it was actually very low end of the range. So typically we're hearing prices more in the eight percent range McDonald's to 10 to put laid took about 11 and a half on their menu. So to have six percent price increase year-to-year really is exceptional, but only in the sense that it's lower than what you're seeing at most other restaurants. And finally, Sarah, I want to get back to the point you made about China. I mean, certainly the expectation seems to be that if there is some softening on a zero COVID policy activity, pick up people go back into stores, you know, these are all positives, especially for retailers like Starbucks, but we're also looking at some significant downturn in terms of the economy, in terms of the broader growth that we're seeing unemployment higher in the second largest market there. I mean, what's a realistic expectation about how much Starbucks can return to to what extent Starbucks can return to pre pandemic levels in China? Well, I think, you know, a couple things one is just in terms of thinking about the pace of growth that Starbucks has in China, big part of it has been new unit growth. So same store sales will certainly prior to COVID were healthy in that kind of three to four percent range, but really the big driver of growth and a value creation for Starbucks and for Chinese consumers has been opening of new restaurants. So, you know, the expectations that they can continue to do that at a low double digit pace, certainly if you look at the store base, you know, it's roughly 6,000 that compares to the US of over 14 or 15,000. So, you know, think about the relative size of the population. It certainly would seem to suggest that they're targeted about 9,000 stores in China's eminently achievable. So, I don't see reason to think that that universe has to slow. To your point, you know, Starbucks is very cognizant of the economic pressures facing the country, but I think, you know, what they have done so well in the last few years is really adapt their loyalty program and make sure that they can really speak directly to customers one to one, which I think is very important at all times, but certainly as consumers are thinking about their budget, as they're thinking about where they want to spend their discretionary dollars. Sarah Seneswar, Bank of America, Senior Restaurants Analysts, it's good to talk to you today, really appreciate the time. Well, coming up thousands of Twitter employees to be losing their jobs today, I'm already a lawsuit in the works on the back of that. We're going to tell you about it after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,73,2022-11-04 18:57:03
4886,!!! You you you you you,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,74,2022-11-04 19:01:30
4887," time as we enter the final down up just under 200 po buying action over the last or so to you look at the s positive territory still you can see well off its just around 7 tens of a at the nasak 100 that is for the day at least on look at some of the other let's take a look on a w basis here nasak for the ready to concede off just as door dash comes up let the major averages here the week in the red and the Dow and the SMP you around 2% over the past also in the red off just as well taking a look at that we're seeing play on an intraday basis you financials as the leaders the only sector trading on a five day basis the leader there up just a look at some of the we mentioned the fact taking a sharp hit on s services and technology in the market today and inside the Dow a bit of past five days but on int looking at Microsoft hold Morgan in the green honey pushing to the upside to the market and we're trying to hold on to that good news you can call it in the jobs report the market is looking at it as good news at 3.7% unemployment rate which was a bit higher than what we got in the last reading the markets a bit encouraged by that is the sign that maybe potentially the Fed will not be as hawkish as they have been anticipating sets the big driver in today's markets for sure. All right but I also want to get you up to speed on what is happening with oil and China will connect those dots for you just a second of the day. I'm going to take a look at what we're seeing with WTI and crude receiving that it's up more than 5% here that's rallying to a three week high also Brent crude there up about four and a third of a percent now we've got a few factors of play we have G7 countries agreeing on a price capping mechanism on Russian crude you also have the US dollar losing some strength on use on some news that on that news and also China the world's biggest crude import to reportedly planning to scrap a policy that's penalizing airlines based on co-vid cases brought into the country and of course any rumor or sign of a potential easing of China's zero-covid policy that's also trickling over to China's ADR so we're going to hop over this we can see how the Chinese stocks are doing today and as we can see here you have some of the bigger players you have bar by here rallying more than five and a half percent you have been world are there up more than nine percent JD dot com there up almost nine percent as well and we're also seeing the EVs look at neo they're up more than 15 percent on the day and we also have the auto that's up more than 7 percent on the day and trip.com as you can see over here up more than 5 percent on the day as well. All right well the top story for markets today as China was just discussing the jobs report and the labor market showing signs of resiliency but there could be some concerns on the horizon. How employers adding 261,000 jobs last month thousands more than expected and employment rising slightly to 3.7 percent when Michelle Gerard had a US net West global economics joins us now to break down those numbers so obviously this is just one of the metrics that the Fed watches what are your big takeaways from this job state. I think stepping back even with the next messages you have to conclude that the labor market is holding up pretty well in the face of what has been I think aggressive action from the Federal Reserve to date I think it suggests that the Fed has more to do with the federal government. The Fed has been signaling that since on Wednesday the Fed has signaled that alongside the 75 basis point rate increase that rates were going to continue to rise they might rise slower going forward but that the Fed was believing that interest rates were ultimately that it had higher than they had thought maybe even a month ago. So I think this is this report is consistent with the Fed thinking that it's too early to think about in the Rehijk cycle. Michelle, it certainly does seem like that but it's interesting when you take a look 10 numbers about the cert你說 5 but it's about Welding mayor. flakes 10",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,75,2022-11-04 19:06:15
4888," the feds thinking that it's too early to think about a stop in the rate high cycle. Michelle certainly does seem like that but it's interesting when you take a look at the markets reaction we were up almost 600 points at the highs of the session of course we're pretty far off those highs but when you take a look I guess at any signs of weakness you mentioned the unemployment rate 3.7% just what is that signal to you I guess maybe is potentially the labor market finally slowing down. Well there may be some hands as you said the unemployment rate moved higher and moved up as employment as measured by the household survey actually declined so when the Bureau of Labor Services calls households and asked them if they're working as opposed to looking at what employers say they found actually far fewer people working than than the month before and you know maybe that's a sign of some of some easing although that number is so volatile month to month you know I think when you look at the hourly earnings number you know that number came down on a year-over your basis maybe that has speak there's some other signs that perhaps wage pressures are beginning to ease ever so slightly. To me that is really something that would be such a welcome development for the fed to see if there is some cooling on wage pressures then I think that would begin to begin to get the fed to feel a bit more comfortable or confident that in fact as we look ahead to 2023 inflation can indeed begin to move sustainably lower. And Michelle what about the quality of jobs that are still on the table because that seems to be an issue some of these lower-paid jobs still a lot of openings obviously they were the hardest hit during the peak of the pandemic. You were still seeing a very high number of job openings now I will say in this month's report the job gains were fairly broad-based and you did give a big gain in manufacturing which tends to be higher paid but you also as always saw a big increase in service employment up to 100,000 and you know and there you did see kind of some split in terms of some of the lower wage categories but it was it was a bit evenly more dispersed. The truth is a lot of the demand for labor in those lower paid industries it's just still very difficult to find workers as you said those sectors were hard hit during the pandemic a lot of individuals left those jobs and they they've gone out they've upscaled themselves they've educated themselves they're not looking to go back to those lower earning wages and as a result you're seeing still a real difficulty I think for employers to define and actually hire those workers of workers into those jobs. So Michelle going back to what you were saying just a few minutes ago about what the signals for the Fed you basically were saying that it kind of reinforces the current path of rate hikes that the Fed had been on but when it comes to that next meeting and there's a number of data points I know between now and the December meeting but what do you think is most likely on the table could we get another 75 basis point hike. We could but as you said there are a couple of very important inflation reports that that will be due out our feeling is the inflation numbers may show ever so slightly some pooling and that combined with the fact that Fed has already done a great deal we think they will come down on the side of moving a bit more slowly so we expect a 50 basis point hike but I think importantly whereas many perhaps had thought that would be it and the Fed would cause in 2023 we had all long thought we'd still see a couple of additional smaller rate hikes in the first half of next year and I think the comments and the data the policy has gotten from the Fed and the data suggests that that the rate hiking cycle is indeed likely still over so we may get 50 basis points in December but again a couple of further fractions in the first half of 2023. And Michelle what are you watching outside of what the Fed can do obviously we've heard a lot about hiring freezes and layoffs but we still see this very strong job market what is the fact as outside of the Fed's control that you're watching well I mean in general I think you know for the Fed there's the question is just what you know how how much will these slow down in economic",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,76,2022-11-04 19:10:10
4889," Well, I mean, in general, I think, you know, for the Fed, there's the question is just what, you know, how, how much will the slowdown and economic activity actually bring inflation lower? So, you know, I think that is the, that's the question. We may see weak economic data. We may see the demand for labor, fall. We may see job openings begin to pull back. It's not quite evident yet. But even if the economy slows, we've got to see some evidence that that will transmit into lower inflation. And I think that that will happen. And so I'm just watching for signs ultimately, the, the turn in terms of the market, the turn for the Federal Reserve being able to fall up peak in the rate hiking cycle, it all, all roads lead back to when does inflation peak and begin to move sustainably lower. And so keeping an eye on all of that, and I think you've got to look at more than just the, you know, how strong the economy or weak the economy is because that may not be back into, you know, we could go with may not be back into lower inflation. I think keeping an eye on any signs of inflation or wage pressures moving lower is ultimately going to be the key for market and for their and, and for Fed action. All right. Well, we do thank you for joining us, Michelle Gerard. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Thank you. This afternoon. All right. Well, we're just getting started here when you're finally it's live coming up. Elon Musk says Twitter is facing a quote, massive drop in revenue. Who he's blaming. Plus, Twilio shares plunging on wheat guidance. The company's COO of Twilio joins us to explain what he thinks the market is getting wrong. And mixed moves in the payment space, paypal shares under pressure, but it's a strong date for block and we have an analyst who's bullish on both. We'll take a closer look. Don't go anywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,77,2022-11-04 19:14:51
4890," Elon Musk says Twitter is suffering from a, quote, massive drop in revenue. Now, the finance says Dan Howley joins us now with the details. So Dan, was this expected? It kind of isn't just the way, you know, that the tweet was kind of unexpected, but the moves that we've seen kind of were expected. So the main tweet that Elon sent out is Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups, pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation, and we did everything we could to appease the activists. Extremely messed up, they're trying to destroy free speech in America. Now, I mean, it's free speech for a company to decide whether it wants to advertise with Twitter or not. So, you know, it cuts both ways. But what he's referring to is the number of companies that are stepping back, pausing, or at least putting on hold their advertising campaigns on Twitter. That includes the likes of GM, General Mills, Pfizer, Volkswagen. We had Mondalees also putting their advertising campaigns on hold. And really what this comes down to is just the fact that they're not entirely sure what's going to happen at Twitter. Elon Musk has gutted the C-suite, gotten rid of the board, fired numerous employees today, and you know, we're still not exactly certain what he's going to be doing with Twitter. Now, he has released previous statements saying that he doesn't want the company to turn into a essentially lawless hellscape. He has said that he wants it to be warm and welcoming, and that they will work with advertisers. They also spoke to members of civil rights groups who were concerned about the potential for a hate speech to take over on Twitter because Elon Musk has said that he wants to see fewer or relaxed moderation there. And so I think what's going on here is these companies are essentially saying, look, we're just hedging our bets on whether or not Twitter is going to be a good place for our products to be displayed as parts of ads. They don't necessarily want things like Oreos showing up next to some kind of insane tirade. So it makes sense for these companies, and Elon Musk is obviously bothered by that. And so he's saying that it's essentially some kind of larger activist campaign when it could simply be companies doing their due diligence. It is certainly a challenging time here for Twitter. You could also say that about the broader tech space. I also want to talk to you though about what we're seeing play out in gaming because it's an industry that's clearly been under pressure just this week, EA lowering its expectations in terms of guidance. Part of that due to the slowdown that we've seen in gaming. Is that going to turn around any time soon? Yeah, it's unlikely. The holiday season is generally the best time for gaming sales. And you know, you might expect that it would be able to raise the prospects for gaming this year just based on the fact that that's when so many people go out and buy. But it's been hit so much from the drops that we've seen due to the comparisons to the pandemic era that it's unlikely that we're going to see those shoot up anytime soon. There's also just a lack of high quality titles that are expected for the holidays or that are coming out for the holidays. There's two standouts right now or three standouts. There's God of War, Ragnarok and the Clistol Protocol. Those are still coming. We did see Call of Duty come out. We had FIFA come out, both of those games, FIFA and Call of Duty had huge numbers of players so there is an appetite there for games. It's just that there aren't enough for people to get excited about and purchase. All right, Dan Halle. Thanks. As always, of course, we will keep tracking that. We'll talk a little bit more about gaming here in just a few minutes. But first, let's take a look at the broader tech space because tech stocks have taken a beating in recent weeks amid an advertising slump and higher rates. And a number of those companies in the sector announcing layoffs and hiring freezes. So here to discuss all of that as well as what lies ahead for the tech media industry. We want to bring in Michael Wolfe, activate consulting founder and CEO. Michael, it's great to have you here. So let's take a step back and talk about some of the ad trends that we're seeing play out in the sector. We're just talking to Dan about what's going on specifically at Twitter. And that's a bit of a different story. The more we're seeing play out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,78,2022-11-04 19:18:54
4891," Let's take a step back and talk about some of the ad trends that we're seeing play out in the sector. We're just talking to Dan about what's going on specifically at Twitter and that's a bit of a different story. The more we're seeing play out in some of the other names in this space. We heard from meta, alphabet, snap, all suffering from a slowdown in advertising spending. What you're take away from what we're seeing there. Advertisers are looking for a couple of things. One is they're looking for performance. Are they going to get sales? The second thing they're looking for is momentum. Is there going to be more consumer revenue? The third is they're looking for safety, which is this is the issue with Twitter. Some of it is and a lot of these the performance is going down and so Facebook is less effective and so you can see and others. Google the cost of the keywords is going up. Performance is not great. Momentum, if you look at some of the major sites, their engagement is going down and so it's not as if the overall sector and part of what's also driving these big layoffs is there's that online never let a good crisis go to waste. All of these companies have got been bloated lots of staff that they need and this is a good excuse for them to lower the number of staff members. You'll notice they're not selling engine. They're not they're not firing engineers and they're not firing developers because those are the people that they need the most. Michael, this is Rochelle here. In terms of where they're placing these ads, we saw that when Netflix announced that it was having its tiered model, we saw a lot of advertisers pouring into that. Is that where you see more of the future of this going more towards the streaming space? The streaming space it's going to be there's no doubt there's going to be a lot of growth and advertising. The streaming services when you put ads there it's it's really in a lot of ways it's a good substitute for TV. It has some limitations. It's not going to just be Netflix and it's going to be all of the different streaming services are going to launch an ad tier. If you look at peacock that's from NBC Universal that's already gaining a lot of advertising. So obviously video advertising is the most important for selling a lot of things and I think that that's going to continue to grow. Michael, when you take a look at some of the other trends outside of advertising, we've seen Meta really suffer because they haven't been able to sell this whole Metaverse movement to the masses or at least to Wall Street. You can obviously if you take a look at the performance of the stock year today. Is that more of a meta specific story? And what do you think is maybe the bigger story going on with the Metaverse here? It's first of all the term Metaverse is one that now is cringeworthy but and it's been a massive hype cycle but there's a number of reasons why this is real. One of the mis you have 300 million people that are ready in what are Metaverse environments between Roblox Minecraft Fortnite. You have people who are living in these virtual worlds and they're doing a lot of the things that are important for them to be in a metaverse. In terms of Meta, well a lot the entire bet is on headsets and it's on VR and we don't believe our firm activate we don't necessarily believe that this is going to be VR. Most people can't be in VR for more than about a half an hour and all of those games they're 2D experiences today so it really comes down to a 1500 dollar headset is very expensive for most consumers to pay. And Michael I want to ask you since you're talking about a gaming the global video gaming market. Now you expect it to grow to nearly 222 billion by 2026. Talk about what are going to be the real growth drivers there and where you see that as you mentioned things like like VR on the Metaverse as well. Well one of the growth drivers is this is a hit driven business and so we're going to continue to see franchises, established franchises, releasing new games. That's one of the things. I think also we're going to see a lot more gamers. Gaming has been very attractive for women. You see a lot of different groups of people coming in. You also see it isn't just mobile games. You see a lot more people having access to high speed internet so those games are wired and they're and they're already multiplayer games. So it's an activity that's going to continue to grow and it's just taking a bigger piece of people's entertainment and technology time. And Michael we've already seen some consolidation within the gaming industry but do you think we'll likely see more in the years ahead? We think that there's going to be more consolidation. In fact what we believe is all of the major technology companies are going",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,79,2022-11-04 19:23:11
4892," likely see more in the years ahead? We think that there's going to be more consolidation. In fact, what we believe is all of the major technology companies are going to end up buying the game companies. And we saw this begin this year with Microsoft Buying Activision. But if they're all going to be in the gaming business, if they're all going to be moving towards interactive worlds like Metaverse, they're going to need to own gaming companies. And if you look at the value of most of the gaming companies, they're worth about a day's volatility in most of these other stocks. So it's obvious to us that this is where it's going to go. And the ones that are most attractive within that space, I guess, how are you trying to parse through and identify the winners or losers? Because what we just heard from Dan is that I guess they don't all stock up as even at this point. Well, they're not even the, it's the franchises that matter. And so they need to decide, usually, yes, the last quarter of the years where there's a lot of activity. And let's be clear, part of this is driven by just releases of game titles. And so it comes down to when each company is going to release a game title. When they release a new title, it's unbelievable. I mean, you had the last red dead redemption. It was released. It was almost $1 billion in the first weekend. So this will come down to when they release and what they release. And Michael, I know, obviously, Twitter gets a lot of headlines at the moment when it comes to social media. But obviously, when you talk social media, you have to talk about TikTok. A lot of growth, still a lot of growth potential here. But obviously, US regulators really starting to crack down on TikTok as well. How do you see social media use growing? And what do you see as the biggest headwinds for the industry? TikTok is a disruptive force, not just in social media, but across all technology and media. So if you look at the amount of time that the average TikTok user is based on our research, in some cases, it's over an hour a day. It's becoming a good alternative to search. There are a lot of people who are, when they go to a search, then instead of going to Google, they're going to TikTok. And of course, media is replacing a lot of the longer forms of video. It's hard, given the popularity of this, it's a huge mistake for the government to try to regulate it. What ends up happening is when you don't allow people to have a legitimate reason to access something in technology and media, they find it a illicit way of doing it. So it'll be a huge mistake, and it's hard to enforce. It's certainly be interesting to watch out all plays out. Michael, if you're great to have, you think so much to join us in studio. Great to be here. Coming up, investors, don't see drop kings as a winning bet at least today. Shares plunging. Look at that. Just around 27%.

4893," in It's time for Triple Play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We have Atlassian, draft kings, Adidas, or Adidas. For that we'll have Jeravlick rejoining us. I'll start with my pick, which is Atlassian Corporation, Tick a Team, TEAM, TEAM. The stock in the software design and project management hosting company plunged into two year lows. You can see that down about 30% on the day after reporting fiscal 1st quarter 2023 financial results. 7 years of 807 million was a touch higher than expected, a profit of an adjusted basis of 36 cents a share. That felt slightly short, but it was the slowdown in the conversion of free users to paid plans becoming more pronounced that investors really seemed to hone in on. Now existing paid users are also slowing as companies as we've been reporting a tightening their purse strings in this current macroeconomic environment. That followed a raft of price cuts, including from Mitsuho, $255 a share from 320, from Baird, 210 a share from 380 from Goldman Sachs, 265 a share from 300. So obviously a sharp reaction there and the stock continuing to be under pressure this afternoon. And Michelle, I actually got downgraded by McQuerry, downgraded to neutral. They cut their purse target to 147 from 287. So so higher from where it is today, but you can really show just by those revisions how bearish Wall Street is getting on this day. We can take a look at today's drop. It's just off the lows of the day, but we could be looking at the worst day on record for this stock. We do see losses of just over 30%. But certainly a very uncertain and tough macroeconomic environment. We're seeing that effect the name there. My pick today is draft King shares plunging after its latest earnings report showing that sports betting a user growth has slowed the company posted a 22% gain in users, but that was down from 30% in the prior quarter. And the draft King's is under pressure from Wall Street to become a profitable, which is CEO Jason Robbins says that he still thinks is possible by the fourth quarter of next year on the earnings call. Robbins also discussed spending and a shift from local to national ads as the company expands in more states. Jared, we've seen more and more states legalized sports betting yet we haven't really seen that reflected in draft King's stock. We're looking at massive losses today. And for the year, this stock really has been under pressure. Mike, we were just talking the break shone that any time it seems like every day we have a handful of stocks, which are just plummeting. Let's pull up the Wi-Fi interactive and I can show you we are now back down to what was support in the earlier part of the year. This is a year-to-day chart, down 58%. But let me show you a max chart because as we are all discussing, this was a spack way back in the day. It came to market at $10 a share and guess what? It is almost at right back at that price here. It's another one of those pandemic, I guess, source sports right now. So let's get back to the main point here because I am looking at something that is up today and this is the European Sports Apparel Juggernaut Adidas, up about 25% and having some of its best day since 2005. And this is on the news that it's in talk with the outgoing Puma CEO, Bjorn Gouldin, to take over from current CEO, Casper Vorsted. Now, Gouldin is leaving Puma at the end of the year already amid record profits and sales. Yet the stocks of both Adidas and Puma, numbers 2 and 3 in the athletic sector, are both considerably down this year. Though Adidas is off a bit more, perhaps due to its controversial relationship with Yay, which it recently terminated. Now, I want to go back to the Wi-Fi Interactive and just show you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,81,2022-11-04 19:32:02
4894," This year, though, a deed is off a bit more, perhaps due to its controversial relationship with Yeh, which it recently terminated. Now, I want to go back to the Wi-Fi interactive and just show you a comparison chart. This is a deed as versus Puma. I said they were neck and neck, both down about 60% on the year. Although if you take a look at the last three years, it is favoring Puma a bit there, Shana. Yeah, it certainly is. When you take a look at a deed as the company needed to do something to turn things around at least, that was the message that we're getting from Wall Street. Adidas had really been under fire most recently because of the partnership with Kanye. So it'll be interesting to see how this new CEO approaches maybe future partnerships like this here, Rochelle. Yeah, we know that Adidas also teamed up with British Rapper Stormsie. Hopefully that will end a little bit better than the collaboration with Kanye for sure. Yeah, it's certainly Wall Street. Pretty excited about this move today. Coming up, Dr. Fauci, saying that the US is at a pandemic crossroads. Find out what's concerning the White House of Chief and Medical Advisor most as we approach the Winter Month's next. Thank you. It's been buying things. It's been a wild day for the markets on the heels of the October jobs report. You can see gains across the board down now up 312 points was up just around 600 points at the highs of the session. Also holding on to gains as well as a NASDAQ investors encouraged by the uptick that we saw in the unemployment report. So we need to talk about how the equity market is looking at this and what this convene for the last couple of months of the year. We want to bring in Julian and Manuel Everkore, ISI, Senior Managing Director and Julian. It's great to see you. So I guess just your takeaway from the jobs report and kind of the wild action that we've seen play out in the market today. It's a really extraordinary day in every respect.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,82,2022-11-04 19:36:27
4895," So I guess just your takeaway from the jobs report and kind of the wild action that we've seen play out in the market today. Really an extraordinary day in every respect. And I think that if you had asked most investors how the market would react, given today's numbers, they would have said a strong rally would have been last on their list of outcomes. For us, this is a process. It's not that the market's getting comfortable with where the Fed needs to go. That's going to be difficult to play out. But what we've really seen was a geopolitical boost here that is helping to turn sentiment. And we think kick off the next leg of this bear market rally. The news out of China really quite good that they're going to advance the dialogue. At some point over the weekend towards the zero COVID eventual reopening. And then she's comment about not wanting to see any sort of nuclear weaponry used in Europe really, really helps at the margin to do some de-risking to the European situation. Very positive. Yeah, so Julie, when you take a look at that, the fact that you see that this could potentially be the next leg of the bear market rally. How high do you think we could potentially hit? So basically when we've done a lot of work on what bear market rallies tend to look like. Now the starting point for this one at the trough on October 13 was down 27.5%. When you get a bear market rally starting from that deep a selloff, the average tends to be up around 17.5% from that level. So this rally could carry all the way to 4,000, but there's another added aspect to it. Is that the seasonality, not only the fourth quarter, but the tendency for stocks to do well after the midterms and into the following year is very, very strong. So then, Julie, in terms of the minds that you should have, if you have a shorter investing time horizon versus a longer one, how should you be approaching the markets right now? Well, if you have a shorter time horizon, you really, really need to trade smaller positions, give them a lot more leeway. And from our point of view, this is a situation where you want to be selective buyers of value type stocks. We've seen a lot of pain in the growth space over the last couple weeks. The earnings season has not been kind in general to fang, but value stocks in a high inflation environment and a high interest rate environment tend to do well. They've outperformed this year. We think that continues to be the trend. And as you look at the rest of the earnings season, what are some of the bell weather companies that you're going to be keeping on that will really give you a gauge of how you think the economy is fairing or at least how investors think the economy is fairing? Right. We really seen the majority of reports. And this is one of these seasons, not unlike the season in July, where you don't really want to say this stock means this to the economy. Because frankly, the story from an economy wide perspective has been extremely complex. What is interesting and notable for us, though, when you think about the regression of this earnings season is that we got the downgrades to earnings expectations that we thought we would get. In fact, bottoms up consensus is still about six to seven percent above where our next year estimate is. But recently the last several days, those earnings downgrades have started to flatten out. And that alone, regardless of the kind of commentary you're here, you'll hear in the last couple of weeks from the tag ends of reports is likely to support equities. All right. We're always great to get your insights. Evercore, ISI, Senior Managing Director, Julian Immanuel. Thank you so much for joining us. Have a great week. Thank you. All right. Coming up, a storm is brewing in the cloud. First, it was Microsoft and Amazon and concerns now rocking shares of Twilio losing a third of their value today. The company COO joins us next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,83,2022-11-04 19:40:26
4896," And concerns now rockenshers of Twilio, losing a third of their value today. The company COO joins us next. Shares of Twilio plummeting after the communications software maker issued fourth quarter revenue guidance below estimates and posted a loss of 27 cents per share during the third quarter. The company had more than 280,000 active customer accounts at the end of Q3 up 5,000 from the previous quarter. We joined by a Cozema Shipchannel at Twilio's COO. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. As we're seeing the stock really under pressure today, what do you think investors are perhaps not getting about this whole picture? Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me. It certainly is a little bit of a humbling day with respect to the stock price. But I think look, the financial framework for the company going forward is actually quite good. It's a tough macro backdrop. No question about that. But as we look at our financial results, we put up a really strong Q3 in a tough macroeconomic environment. We did take down some of our guidance for Q4 and provided a medium term range on the revenue side that was 15 to 25 percent up over the next three to five years. That's how we kind of defined it. And we committed to being a profitable company over that time frame as well. So I certainly understand that there are some macro dynamics here and potentially some dynamics that investors are playing in a wait and see fashion. But we feel really good about the setup of the company and feel really good about the products and customers that we've got. Cozema, when you take a look at the performance in this stock today, obviously Wall Street a little bit concerned about some of the macro headwinds not only facing Twilio, but more so this sector at large, are you seeing, I guess, any delayed purchase decisions or longer sales cycles as a result? And you potentially seeing those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,84,2022-11-04 19:45:04
4897," It's making the rise of businesses are becoming a big win in the early year. I think it's really wild and thick, but this sector at large are you seeing any delayed purchase decisions or long sales so as a result and you potentially see those had. Where's here over the next quarter or two? –I guess it's hard to imagine them getting too much worse but we are definitely seeing some sector impacts, not surprisingly. we're seeing things So I think those are all sectors in which we've seen some impacts across the board. I can imagine that you'll see some additional reports come out from various companies, particularly around CPG and retail over the coming months. But we think we've largely baked that stuff in into our guidance. And so we feel pretty good about the setup of our company. And again, I think we feel like we're going to be profitable irrespective of the environment. And we think it's a good setup for investors going forward, in spite of the correction that occurred today. And in Bank of America's note, I mean, they were complementary about the analyst state that they had presenting it as an opportunity to reset expectations and talking about the shift in focus from growth to delivering meaningful operating profits. What is the strategy there? Well, we always want to be a growth company, right? I mean, we were a technology company. We're of such a vintage that we think we can continue delivering high growth rates for a long period of time. And at our scale, we're growing 15 to 25% as about a $4 billion company, which I think is quite impressive. That said, I think we should also reap the economies of scale that come with being a large company. We don't just want to be a big company. We want to be a really great company. And I think part of that is being really profitable. So we committed to being profitable in 2023 on a non-gap basis. We will accomplish that. And then thereafter, we also committed to ongoing op-margin accretion, which we have good plans to deliver. We'll generate leverage across most of our cost categories. And I think our software products will really start picking up as well. And we've got some really exciting stuff in the pipeline between Flex, our contact center product, and then segment and engage on the data side. And speaking of costs there, you're coming in announcing layoffs, 11% of the workers back in September. When you look ahead here, do you see the need to potentially, I guess, insert some more cost-cutting measures as you do remain focused on profitability next year? Yeah, I don't see that today. I think that it's a fair question. But based on the plan that we put together, we came up with a variety of scenarios that we could imagine, some of which are relatively dire, in fact. And so we feel pretty good about what we did. I think we'd been thinking about right sizing the workforce for a while. I think we got a little bit ahead of ourselves in terms of what happened during COVID, vis-a-vis hiring. It's unfortunate, really difficult decision, obviously. But I think it was appropriate and the right thing for us to do to set up the long term of the company. Going forward, I wouldn't take anything off the table ever, obviously. But we feel pretty good about the setup right now, and I don't see us having to do anything further currently. And some of the key partners of Twilio that Bank of America survey talked about the competitive pricing pressure that might intensify, intensify, because Twilio does have a premium pricing on it. Are there any plans to perhaps adjust pricing given what the competition is doing and given the macroeconomic background? No, not right now. I mean, honestly, we feel pretty good about the competitive dynamic. We feel pretty good about the way that we're priced. We do feel like we offer a premium technology offering. And yeah, there's a higher price that goes with that, but I think it's also a better product. And we have different products and different competitive sets based on the way that those things shake out. We're different in data, we're different in marketing, we're different in context center. And then again, a little bit different competitive set in communications. But in each of those, we command a price premium. We feel like we deserve that, and we feel like the technology is superior to the competitors. Well, Kuzama, we really appreciate you coming on today, especially given that such a tough day when you take a look at the stock price off just around 35% we hope to have you back. Kuzama, Ship Chandler, Twilio's COO. Great. Thanks for having me. Well, the CDC saying today at a media briefing that the flu and respiratory viruses are hitting much harder and earlier than in the past. Angelic Hamlani joins us now with more on this. And I guess Andrew already been.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,85,2022-11-04 19:49:35
4898," ED are briefing that the flu and respiratory viruses are hitting much harder and earlier than in the past. Angelique Imlani joins us now with more on this. And I guess Andriv already, I guess, heard the warnings that hospitals are beginning to overfill, but what else could we potentially see now over the next couple of months? Well, we're definitely potentially going to be seeing COVID still. That's still on the horizon and plays into that threat of the triple-demic, tri-demic, you know, triple threat, whatever you want to call it. We know that Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, was talking about this in a radio interview recently and stressing the fact that the country is not really at a good place when it comes to finding the virus. We're still at more than 400 deaths per day. We're still in the thousands and tens of thousands of cases per day. And that is still leading the world, so not a good place at all. And with winter variants or new variants on the horizon, that is potentially going to be a fair worse. We know that we've been following the BQ-1, BQ-1, one variants. And they now combined makeup 35 percent. That's an increase from the last time we discussed this. It was 27 percent before the CDC now saying it accounts for 35 percent of cases. But now looking at RSV and flu, that is already stressing really the East Coast right now, the Minutelanic, New England, Washington area, currently experiencing significant capacity strains according to the CDC. And they're expecting that this will move through in waves, hitting other parts of the U.S. similar to the way that COVID did in the past years. Now, what's important about noting the RSV and flu early season, it's really an early and strong season for both in flu specifically, the highest level of hospitalizations that they've seen at this point in time in the year in over a decade. So that's where some of the concern is coming from. And clear whether or not it will be a quick rise and plateau or if it will be a sustained surge of cases around the country, that's something that the CDC officials were unable to really pin down. But that's sort of where things stand. And we heard from specifically CDC's Dr. Jose Romero saying that previous years, eight-typical seasons due to mitigation against COVID left a large swath of the U.S. population and uninfected, so children need to be infected and essentially to get passed in now. And the masking that was taking place before helped to keep all this at bay in the past few years. And, Angela, understand that Pfizer's released some new data on Omicron boosters. What can you tell us about that? That's right. As anticipated, we know that their updated booster by valent booster has been effective and is supposed to be more effective. And in fact, then the initial strain, which is why administration officials have stopped offering the original vaccine and are pushing the updated by valent booster, a new data out today, saying that it was four times more effective for older individuals, which is really the target of this new shot. So after a month, they're seeing a really good protection levels as anticipated. Sorry, I'm going to be some encouraging news area. Angela Kimlani, thanks so much. We're coming up returning a purchase or a gift that you don't need may become more costly. Find out why next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,86,2022-11-04 19:53:42
4899," How to würde choose Shoppers beware retailers are rethinking their return policies ahead of the holiday shopping season. More businesses can't seem to afford these returns, adding a significant burden to retailers' storage challenge. So what do you think, Sean? How much do you think this is going to discourage consumers from returning to stores? Because I know the free shipping button is something, but knowing that I might have an issue with returns, especially for the holidays, that's asking a lot, I think. Yeah, I think it's huge. I was actually a recent survey out showing that consumers, 98% consumers, say that free shipping is the most important consideration when they're buying online, and that also goes for free returns as well. So I think so many people are used to what's happened over the last two and a half years during the pandemic. They've been able to extend that return window or have been able to return their online purchases for free. So I think this could potentially really impact sales at specific stores. We've already seen a number of stores short in their return window gap. O'Neary, Jay, crew are among them now. There are a little bit of different rules as we lead up to the holiday shopping season. We certainly have seen retailers become a little bit more lenient over the next two or three months. But the fees, I think, to return items. I know Anthropology, LLB, cost about $6 return item. And I think that that is enough to maybe, I guess, discourage some people from buying from those stores. That's true, because I mean, when you think of Nordstrom, one of the things that they're known for is having this obviously very flexible return policy, and they haven't waived on that even during the pandemic. But I think when at a time when people have less discretionary income and it takes that much little to sort of put you off, if you know you might end up paying a fee, not just for something you bought for yourself, but potentially for one of, you know, for someone you're giving a gift to, for me, that's going to make me think twice and definitely read the small print before I hit buy on the button for sure. Alright, we'll leave that there, but coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street, stick with us here on your finance life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,87,2022-11-04 19:58:10
4900," o Just about 90 seconds to go until the closing bell still looking at gains across the board in adjusting performance how did And some of the rate sensitive stocks, the I growth names, those have gotten hit this week. On the sector action on a daily chart, you'll see materials, financials, technology, leading. But a five day chart shows you communication services technology, consumer discretionary. Those were the losers for the week. And keeping it on that five day chart, you can see the NASDAQ 100, Apple down 11% over the last five days, Amazon down 12%. Here's the closing bell for today, Friday, November 4th. MUSIC And now you have it ending this first week of November in the green to the major indices. Let's take a deeper dive here. We see the down there up about 400 points there, though pairing back some of the gains of the day, the S&P 500 there, of about 50 points there, one and a third of a percent of the tech of the NASDAQ, up about one and a third of a percent. They're all three up for the day, but down for the week. Well, let's take a closer look at the broader markets. Let's bring in our market panel. We have Sean O'Hara, president of PASA ETFs, and Harley Vassman, simplifies managing partner. Welcome to you both. So, Harley, I first want to start with you. How would you characterize the action that we're seeing in the market to end the week? You know, all we're trying to do is basically process the Fed, process inflation, process interest rates. They've kind of told us what's going to happen over here, and it's going to play out a little more than people thought, but very slowly. And the market's got to go to just the fact that we're going to have higher rates for the next six months or so. So, Sean, what do you think that means for the market action over the next couple of months? And did you hear anything this week, either from the Fed or from the jobs report this morning or earnings reports that really made you maybe change your view about the coming months? Well, thanks for having me. No, nothing I heard this week really change any other than the resounding announcement this morning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,88,2022-11-04 20:02:40
4901," It really made you maybe change your view about the coming months. Well, thanks for having me. No, nothing I heard this week really changed any other than the resounding announcement this morning on the job side, which sort of gives cover to the Fendt to continue their path forward in terms of aggressively raising interest rates. And so for the entire year, that's been the theme. High inflation, high interest rates means lower PEs for starting. We were seeing those PEs come down. They're now sort of still above historical levels, but down quite substantially, but that doesn't mean that they can't continue to fall. And so the advice we had been giving to people all year long is it's time for you to lower your overall portfolio's PEs before the market does it to you. It's done a fair amount and it probably can continue to do some more, but there are places in this market to make money. I think if you buy high quality stocks with high free cash flow or high free cash flow yield, you can buy stocks that are cheaper than the overall market unless susceptible to that multiple. And the contraction that always seems to go hand in hand with rising interest rates and rising inflation and the two standouts in our largest ETF that two standouts are two biggest sector weights are energy and health care with a little tilt. The third would be materials. And so we've been positioned pretty well and that fund is a large KBUS fund that's basically up for the year, even though the markets down more than 20%. And obviously we tend to watch the bond markets for any sort of signals anytime the Fed speaks so highly you're known as the convexity maven talk about the movement that you're seeing in bonds and what the volatility there is telling you. Well, I mean rate volatility is very high. So the move index, which is the the VIX for bonds is running around 141.50, which is basically it's price levels, but the reality is the market is moving that much every day. So it's legit the contrast of course is the VIX, it's 25, which is not that far above its long term average. It's talked to down 20% but it's been an orderly decline. We just don't know how far the Fed's going to take us and that's the uncertainty in bonds and that's why they're gapping up and down so much. But I will tell you that my view is that we're getting near the peak for the front end. The Fed might take rates to 475, maybe 5%, but the two year where it is right now is probably pricing in the right number. And what we don't know is the back end. Long term rates have not risen up. The curve's inverted and the inversion in the market market. You'll come very good at calling on recessions as calling for one next year and the markets pricing it out for recession sometime next year. Well we get that I don't know but that's the uncertainty of the stock market as we can't tell if earnings are going to drop or not. But the bottom market they've kind of got this thing pegged. Convexity, Maven, Harley, I like that. Sean, let me ask you about what you said earlier here when you talked about a negressive Fed. What do you think is most likely? I guess do you think a 75 basis point hike is on the table and how much of that has been priced into the market if at all at this point? Yeah, and so some of it probably has. But I think it's likely that you'll see 75 basis points out of the Fed this next move only because the job market continues to remain fairly strong. I think the things to watch from the Fed side is if they start to see massive demand destruction in terms of the overall economy and you start to see unemployment start to rise, then they'll be in a position where the perhaps they need to sort of ease up a little bit. I think that's what we're all hoping at some point that the Fed will ease. But I don't think I got anything out of what Chairman Powell said this week in any of the recent actions that would let me come to the conclusion that they're going to do anything other than what they said, which is continued to aggressively raise interest rates to try to tame inflation. John, what about the risk of the Fed going too far? Do you think that that is a possibility up until this point? You know, they hardly ever get it right. So, you know, they probably will go too far. You know, I have a different view on what the real problem is right now. I don't think it's an overheated economy. I think it's energy prices that are driving inflation across all parts of the sectors of our economy. And I think that's a supply issue, as opposed to a real interest rate driven solution. And so they probably will get it wrong. You know, the thing that you have to keep an eye on, it will tell you whether they're really getting it wrong is if inflation starts to peak, or pick up. And then guidance is really the most important thing going forward. So you've got a range on S&P earnings for next year, somewhere between $200 a share and $233 a share. So it's perhaps at the high end. But as these companies start to, you know, get through this fourth quarter and start to give.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,89,2022-11-04 20:06:38
4902," Thanks for the next year, somewhere between $200 who share and $233 shares, so perhaps at the high end. But as these companies start to get through this fourth quarter and start to give us a little hint for what's coming forward, if we see guidance sort of wane a little bit and move towards the downside, then that will tell you that we're probably not going to have this solved the landing in the stock market as the Fed really wants. So, Holly, if we go by their mantra, don't fight the Fed. What does this mean for how people should be balancing their portfolio as in preparation for recession as you're expecting in the next 12 months? Well, I would push back on our other guest over here a little bit. I think the Fed goes 15 next time. I think they're going to go higher than we thought, but they're going to get there slowly. They've already done four big hikes over here. The Minus Nest kind of worked for a little bit. I also don't think that it's actually oil energy per se. I think labor, cost of labor is the real driver over here. The demographics underlying that. What I like in the market, though, I think uni bonds and mortgage bonds have gotten brushed. And they're very solved. They're very safe. You're not taking credit risk with those securities. So, if we do get a recession, we do get the down earnings, we do get the unemployment. You're not going to get hurt with those two investments. Harley Basmonds, Sean O'Hara, we'll have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a good weekend. Thank you, YouTube.

Thanks so much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,90,2022-11-04 20:11:34
4903," Nathan's in a division of SVB, a security is Lisa. It's good to see you cover all three of these companies. So you're the perfect person to have on to ask about this. Let's start with the movement that we've seen in block. We saw shares really take off today following the results that we got last night closing up just over 10% in a note out today. You wrote that after a wild ride over the past two and a half years, blocks business is emerging from the pandemic stronger than ever. Why? So in a couple ways, the cash app business, I'd say, is the real standout. That's their digital bank. They reported yesterday they're up to almost 50 million monthly active users in that product and about 18 million folks that use it like a primary bank account just for a point of reference. Like a JP Morgan or a city have about 30 million mobile bankers. So this is like more than half of where they are. Those are all consumers. What happened during the pandemic when banks were closed, right? And people were home. They downloaded and adopted something like cash app as a form of digital banking. And blocks just done a fantastic job of building an ecosystem around that and really, really pulled in those consumers. That product literally was almost zero five years ago and is now contributing more than half of the gross profits of the company. So, Lucy, in that digital wallet was a survey that you guys have, what stood out to you in terms of the demographics and really the opportunities for growth there? Yeah, it's true. What's interesting is that the digital banks skew younger in terms of cohorts, as you might imagine. But otherwise, there's no particular groups that stand out. They're not lower income. Sometimes there's a perception that the digital bank users are more unbanked. They are actually not. They're very mainstream. These are just simply individuals that are very mobile first and prefer to do all aspects of their life through mobile. But what cash app and what block are really doing there is they are trying to add services to move their way up market to adding investing services, adding lending products to migrate their way up to a more affluent consumer that has a higher spending power, which is how they generate a lot of the revenue for those products. Lucy, how are you looking at blocks crypto part of its business? Because revenue from Bitcoin this quarter, 1.76 billion, that was off about 3% from a year ago, slightly missing the streets expectations. Is this a risk? Do you think for the company given the activity or lack really thereof that we've seen in the crypto market, as of late? Well, it's not a risk in the sense that it runs through the income statement in kind of a funky way. So it shows up as a very big revenue line item and a very big cost item, but you really just net those out. And it's only a couple percent contribution to the gross profit of the company. But it is a very big engagement driver and usage driver. Like a reason people download these apps and really engage with the app's daily will be if they're very active in crypto. And so when we're in a low period like this, a block has to find other ways to engage consumers through other products. Like for example, they bought after pay, one of the big find-out pay later players who has very strong digital shopping services and they're starting to integrate some of that sort of shopping and kind of deals and promotion type of services into the app too. So Lisa obviously then talking about PayPal, which was one of the first names in this space, clearly losing market share to some of this competition here. What is the gross story then for PayPal at this point? They've also tried to add on some services as well. Yeah, PayPal's and it is true. It's there in a challenging position in the sense that they're the granddaddy of this space. They've been so dominant for so long that it's hard for them to maintain that level of a leadership position when you've got Apple Pay and you've got the players like a cash app or a buy-now pay later players kind of nipping away at their heels. So what PayPal has done, I mean, a part of their offering I would highlight is that they have, they bought a company called Brain Tree a number of years ago, which is the big competitor of Stripe and Audien. So more on the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,91,2022-11-04 20:15:15
4904," And highlight is that they bought a company called BrainTree a number of years ago, which is the big competitor of Stripe and Audien, so more on the merchant side. So providing the merchants with a wide set of services, the digital wallets, of course, and the checkout button, but also overall payment processing, things like loans for merchants. So they're sort of steering a lot of their business more toward the merchant side of the equation, where they compete, like I said, with player, you know, some of these big high growth players, like an Audien and a Stripe. Lisa, let's move over to Coinbase because we're seeing the stock pop today, close in the green, well in the green. Yet the company reported a wider loss, revenue was all 54%, shares down nearly 80% this year, yet you have an outperform rating on the stock. Why are you bullish on this name? I love Coinbase. I mean, there's a long-term play, there's no question. And the reality is we're likely, you know, historically crypto winters have typically lasted about two years and we're only about six or nine months into this one, so we've probably got a ways to go if history is any indicator. So there may not be arguably that much urgency, but in terms that we, I think of Coinbase as a very unique asset as a large cap, publicly listed player in crypto and way to play crypto, they're very differentiated in sort of the crypto infrastructure space. You're starting to see them doing these partnerships with a BlackRock or with a Google, where they're sort of the crypto inside, so to speak, where they're providing crypto onboard and capabilities digital assets storage, the ability to convert Fiat into crypto and sort of creating that, you know, they're the plumbing or the rails in those applications. And it's that aspect of their business that I get really excited about. For example, in this quarter, you know, yes, their kind of core transactional revenues are down significantly because just overall crypto trading activity is down, but their subscription and services businesses, which are all of these infrastructure type of services, were up over 40% quarter on quarter, that's sequentially, and are now almost a third of the revenues of Coinbase. And that's the piece I'd really be keeping an eye on over the next couple of years as it becomes a larger part of this business. Coinbase certainly growing with those partnerships, growing its ecosystem. Thank you, Dileesa Ellis. Great to see you have a wonderful weekend. Well, crypto exchange Binance reportedly processing billions of dollars in trades for Iranian firms as to spite US sanctions. Yavu Finance is Jen Shonbogen joins us now with the details, hey Jen. Good afternoon, Michelle. That's right, crypto exchange Binance reportedly processing Iranian transactions in value of nearly $8 billion since 2018, despite US sanctions aimed at cutting Iran off from the global financial system. Writers conducted an analysis with data from three firms that had access to chain analysis reactor investigation software and found that some $7.8 billion of funds flowed between Binance and Iran's largest crypto exchange, Nobitec. Three quarters of Iran's funds that pass through Binance were in a cryptocurrency called TRON. That gives users the option to conceal their identities according to Writers Analysis. Now, in a blog post today, Binance's head of global sanctions, Shagree Boyrez, wrote that as soon as Binance discovered that Iran-based crypto exchanges may have attempted to move crypto through Binance's exchange, the company quote, move to freeze transfers, block accounts, and follow the protocols that are by our compliance team. Boyrez went on to say, we immediately set up a task force to resolve the issue. Any failure of the system is unacceptable to us. And while Binance isn't a US company required to follow American law, we work hard to keep sanctioned individuals off our platform. Now, the head of sanction says Binance uses strong know your customer protocols and invests in technology to ensure that the people who should not be using Binance's exchange are not able to access their ecosystem. But admits the changes playing catch-up and that this is an industry-wide issue. Now, these new findings come as the US Department of Justice is pursuing an investing-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,92,2022-11-04 20:19:35
4905," But admits the dangers playing catch up and that this is an industry-wide issue. Now, these new findings come as the U.S. Department of Justice is pursuing an investigation into possible violations of money laundering rules by Binance. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to the Yahoo Finance for comment. And Treasury also declined to comment saying it does not weigh in on potential violations of U.S. sanctions. Guys. Well, certainly more scrutiny to come. I'm sure a big thank you to our very own Gen. Shonberg. Thanks so much. All right, well staying with crypto, Dogecoin's recent rally coming off the boil amid reports that Elon Musk might scrap or at least postpone his ambitions for some form of integration with Twitter. Online tech publication platformer reporting the social media group's plans over a crypto wallet quote, appear to be on pause. Now Dogecoin rallied over 50 percent the day Musk completed his takeover. And shot up 60 percent over the last seven days but clearly might lose some of their lustre. All right, coming up, former president Donald Trump keeping Republicans on edge about his 2024 plans, but he may finally be ready to make his decision for timeline straight ahead. Well, markets finished the week on upbeat note. The Dow did snap a four week winning streak, but tech still cannot catch a break. Sure as a Facebook parent company meta down more than 73 percent this year making it the worst performer in the S&P 500. And Michelle, we just were talking to Michael Wolf, Alastair, and he was telling us that the company made the phrase metaverse completely cringe worthy. And we see that reflected in the stock price we know meta has lost billions on their VR and AR initiatives, 9.4 billion. So far this year and those losses they're expected to continue to grow. I feel like Emerson's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,93,2022-11-04 20:24:03
4906," billions on their VR and AR initiatives, 9.4 billion, so far this year in those losses they're expected to continue to grow. I feel like Emerson's they changed the name from Facebook to Meta. It really has been something of a curse for them. Obviously they struggled with the Apple privacy laws affecting their revenue there. And really people are still waiting for Meta to get off the ground. Most people either don't know what it is, aren't really understanding the real world, but they're still using it beyond things like occasional gaming, which is what Michael Wolf was saying. Nobody wants to be stuck in a VR world for more than half an hour at a time. So I think this is going to be a long haul. Some people are estimating maybe 10 years before they'd be more widespread adoption. I don't know if investors are willing to wait that long. No, clearly not. Indeed. Exactly. Well, after the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe vs. Wade, voters appeared incensed enough to give Democrats momentum they needed heading into the midterms. But with the election just days away, high inflation and its effects on the economy appeared to be boosting Republicans' chances across the country. Well, for more we're joined by Jo, who financed senior columnist Rick Newman. So Rick, talk about these latest findings we're seeing. We just showed the charts showing that inflation has actually been improving gradually. The peak was at 9% in June. It's now down to 8.2%. Probably going to fall down to around 8% in the next report next week. But consumers actually are getting more worried about inflation, not less worried. And I dug into a big series of surveys the Census Bureau does on a regular basis to gauge how people are doing. They started it this after COVID. And it shows that more people say they are having trouble paying for daily bills now than said so in June when inflation was actually higher and it's considerably higher than it was a year ago. So I think this says two things. One, I think it says, on the longer inflation lasts, the more worried people get about it as they probably should because it's not just going to come and go. It's going to be here and we're going to have sustained price acts for a long time. And I think there probably is also a cumulative impact on family budgets. So when prices go up and stay up, it just is draining and draining and draining over time. And maybe a lot of families can handle one month of higher than expected costs. But when that goes on month after month after month, it gets tougher. And the same sort of everybody, the Census Bureau also shows that more people now are tapping into savings or putting everyday expenses on credit cards. So I think this is why you have seen voters even as gas prices come down. Other bills are going up and voters know that. I mean, they're seeing this every week when they pay bills. And this is why Biden just cannot catch a break even though other parts of the economy notably the job market and the numbers we got today are pretty good. So I think, I mean, we have seen Democratic odds of holding onto Congress just deteriorating for the last month or so. And barring a miracle, they're going to lose either one or both houses next week. Yeah, I'm rick speaking on this momentum that we certainly have seen with the GOP party here as of recent weeks. There's an Axios report out earlier today saying that Trump was potentially eyeing an announcement of the 2024 of his 2024 presidential run on November 14th. I'm just curious, just your reaction to this and just what this signals here for Republicans over the next two years. My reaction is let the circus begin, baby. Let's get started. This is not necessarily good for Republicans. So there's a lot going on behind the scenes here. First of all, many people who are following the never ending Trump spectacle think there's a good chance the federal government could bring charges against him for for his mishandling of classified documents down at his home in Florida after he left the White House. He was not supposed to have classified documents. He did. We that could have been quite alarming. And the Trump probably as it's almost part of his legal defense. You can imagine that he wants to make himself a presidential candidate if the Justice Department is going to go after him so that it makes it look as if it's purely political, which it is not, by the way. He's also facing a very serious lawsuit in Georgia over possible election fraud. There's a grand jury on that with possible charges by sometime next year. Again, Trump probably thinks it will help him out if this looks politically motivated because he's a political candidate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,94,2022-11-04 20:28:16
4907," There's a grand jury on that with possible charges by sometime next year. Again, Trump probably thinks it will help him out if this looks politically motivated because he's a political candidate being prosecuted by a Democrat in Fulton County, Lanna. So there's that element to it. Then there's the whole question of the Florida Governor Ron DeSantis try to run in 2024 as well. Perhaps a more conventional campaign not launched two years ahead of time, but maybe more like 18 months or one year ahead of time. Which would put Trump into Santhus at odds with each other. So that would probably be quite a smackdown. And let's just make sure everybody understands. Trump standing in the Republican Party has declined. I think there are polls now that say, the majority of Republicans say Trump should not run again. So if he does run, it is by no means a given that he would win. Certainly we'll be entertaining watch to say the least. Rick Newman, as always, thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Hi guys, you too. All right, well, come here. Next out of office, companies are rethinking the real estate plans. But how much of a hit does this mean that this sector can take? We speak with the next word from JLL. Next. All right. All right, but sorry about OK. Okay. You This is our rethinking how and where their employees work. Many companies decide not to resign leases in favor of keeping their workers at home. Exxon mobile might be joining them. There's a report in the journal today that the oil joint is considering leasing or selling its unused office space in Houston. The company reporting that only a fraction of its less than half of the available office space that it has on its Houston campus is being used. For more on this and what this means for the commercial real estate market, we want to bring in John Gates, JLL CEO of America's markets. John, it's good to see you Exxon far from the only company. We also heard metad making a similar move in and Atlanticdot? We've been thinking about the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,95,2022-11-04 20:32:52
4908," a bring in John Gates, J-L-L-C-E-O of America's markets. John, it's good to see you, Exxon, far from the only company. We also heard meta making a similar move in Austin earlier this week. Is this consistent with the trends that you're seeing? The corporate America, probably global corporate, still sort of struggle with what return to the office is going to mean on a permanent basis. So we think hybrid work in some form of fashion is here to stay for many companies. And there are some workers that probably would continue to work from home or work remotely much, if not all of the time. Yes, but there is a greater return to office probably that people are aware of right now. And John, what's the regional story? Where are you seeing the most growth when it comes to the return to office story? It is definitely, there is a regional story. So in the United States, that would be across the South. The immigration markets, we call them, but Phoenix is a winter, Metro Dallas is a winter. Austin is a winter, Nashville, Charlotte, Atlanta, certainly South Florida, the Metro Miami area. So it's almost across the board in the larger cities or metro areas across the Southern US. John, you mentioned it was a little bit greater than we think outside of those top cities. What are we seeing play out in the rest of the country? And what did the vacancy rates look like? It definitely varies by city, right? So industries and geographies vary, but it is taking up nationally to very close to 50%. And we're predicting that by the end of the first quarter, could be as high as 60% on an average day, which is a pretty good metric. Office buildings have never been 100% full, right? People come and go, they travel from business, they have personalized that they're working with. So, but vacancy rates are higher in those southern cities, and then the other very strong trend we see is what we call a flight to quality. So newer, you know, better space, more monetized, maybe a better location, closer to public transportation. Space that has a cool factor to it. It's got maybe a good retail amenities in the neighborhood. Those buildings are definitely leasing at a materially higher rate. And they have much greater occupancy than older product does. And John, what do you see in terms of leasing and rental prices? How do they stack up versus pre-pandemic? Tail of two cities. So if we take the last comments for the newer product, the flight to quality, we're seeing all-time peak rents set in probably two-thirds of the big markets in the United States in the last 12 counter months, probably even this year. So that's very different than what we're seeing happen with older office buildings, where they're struggling to maintain rents as high as they had pre-pandemic. So it's very binary in that regard, I would say. John, when you take this and also, I guess, combine the fact that we're in a rising rate environment right now, the Fed saying it's going to remain committed to raising rates that obviously could spell some trouble here for commercial real estate. I'm curious just how this has impacted your investment opportunities. And are you being more conservative given the current macro environment? You're probably more conservative, more disciplined in your decision making, depending on where you're looking. Interest rates, excuse me, commercial office space rely on long-term capital and often debt is part of the capital structure in those. And so the cost of capital is going up. It's going up for all operating businesses as well. And so you're selective in where you look. We see a slowdown in velocity of both sales of assets right now in commercial mortgages. There's a lot less construction activity and any kind of commercial asset class. And I think that'll continue for a while because as you know, the Fed has been very clear that they're not done. And John, is there any sense of when you might see this normalizing at some point? I would think at the end of the first quarter, maybe. I think business people, whether they're investors or operators and operating businesses, want to see trends. And so, inflation's ticked out a little bit. If it starts, if it clearly to business people is moving downward and the Fed's actions are working, that gives a little more predictability to people. And I think you'll start to see transaction activity increase at that time, whether it's signing commercial leases or selling assets or recapitalizing and refinancing them. So, you know, my sense would be that's probably late Q1 or maybe early Q2, but we'll need to can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,96,2022-11-04 20:36:56
4909," or selling assets or recapitalizing and refinancing them. So, you know, my sense would be that's probably late Q1 or maybe early Q2, but we'll need to continue to watch. There's a lot of been flashering pressure out there still. And as we look through the supply chain, whether it's things like labor and in developing some of these things, as well as some of the construction materials prices, what are some of the headwinds or what are some of the pricing that you're expecting there? I think labor will be a greater challenge than supply chain disruptions and spikes in materials cost. Much of the supply chain is renormalized. You see container shipments as an example. The cost of container shipments have come back and the demand for materials has slowed. When you move interest rates as much as they have, you see construction activity really slow down. It has a major impact on the single family housing market, as we all know, and mortgages get very, very expensive. So you see a smaller velocity of people moving and you certainly see a dramatic slow down in construction starts. We have a labor shortage though in our country and our economy. And I think that continues in non-office working jobs for sure. And we have a lot of stimulus still coming. So I think construction spend will shift to maybe ESG related activities, for example, and that needs work and labor as well. So I think materials will be less of a problem, supply chains, and cost of materials will be less of a problem than availability of labor and probably the cost of labor. Certainly a lot to keep an eye on. We do appreciate you breaking all this down for us, John Gates. Thank you so much. Have a great week. Thank you for having me. All right, coming up, fans of Weird Al Yankovich songs like Armageddon Paradise and like a surgeon will be rushing to turn on the Roku channel this weekend or details on the new film next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,97,2022-11-04 20:41:28
4910," It's been a busy week of earnings here. Some of the biggest movers of the week. Let's kick it off with Roku. It's the top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance over the last couple of days. It shares, really took a dive. You can see it reflected in this five-day chart here after a wider than expected loss during the quarter, just another company to suffer from the pullback that we've seen in ads spending shares hitting the lowest level that we've seen since 2019. The week results leading to a number of downgrades on the street. Pivotal research lowering its rating on the stock to sell from hold to Guggenheim, cutting its rating to neutral from by the five-day move in the chart shares closing off just around 9% just below 50 bucks a share. Let's move over to Peloton another wild week in this stock. Although you can see the weekly gains of just over 17% shares initially sold off after the company disappointed the street with its earnings, but they were reassured by some comments that we got from CEO Barry McCarthy, Barry McCarthy making some comments on the turnaround plan. Saying that it was further along, then maybe the street had progressed, saying, quote, the ship is turning. Taking a look at the week to date chart up just around 17% still though below 10 bucks a share. We'll also take a look at Uber another big mover earlier in the week shares soared after the company posted a revenue beat and strong guidance closing Tuesday up 11% sales during the third quarter from 72% from just a year ago for the week. You see a bit of those muted gains, so giving back it at the latter end of the week with Uber closing up just around 3% 28.39 a share. Now let's round it out with Starbucks as we take a look at that five-day chart up just around 5.5% having its best day today and about six months is not closing up just around 8.5% 91.86 a share. Third quarter earnings, beef is street's expectations. Also the company issuing strong fourth quarter guidance. A number of analysts boosting their price targets as a result, RBC upping its target to 80. Bucks credit suites up in there as to 105 Goldman, lifting their price target to 98 bucks a share all about where Starbucks is trading today again for the week shares closing up just around 5.5% for sure. All right, great stuff. Well now here's a look at what we're keeping in mind on Fort next week. On Monday, a quiet day on the economic calendar, but we will get results from Palantir, Lyft and Gaming Giants Activision Blizzard and Take 2 Interactive. And of course the big event on Tuesday, the midterm elections. But on the earnings front there are some key names to watch, especially Disney after the close. Also here from AMC, Occidental Petroleum, Affirm and a CUMI. On Wednesday, roadblocks, Wendy's and Home Builder DR Horton, among the names that are going to be reporting their quarterly earnings. And on Thursday we'll get some economic data including jobless claims, but all eyes will be on the consumer price index, which is out ahead of the open. On the earnings front, retailers Ralph Lauren and Tapestry will also report. And finally, rounding out the week on Friday, we'll get the latest reading on consumer sentiment, certainly lots, for the Fed to digest. Well Twitter offices closed today as employees and now former employees were told earlier they're being laid off or fired via email. And the backlash, now raising the question, in this time of working from home, how do you fire people respectfully? Or quit your job for that matter? Now prior to the pandemic, it was customary to have an in-person conversation, but how have norms shifted in our Slack message and Zoom meeting world shorter? Is there a good way to do it? Do you want to have people travel from wherever they are just to show up and get fired? I think that might be worse. Yeah, that could be worse. And obviously if they live far away, you would have a tough time. I think bringing them into the office, just alone, just knowing what you're going to do. But I don't think you should do this over Slack or through an email. I think if you aren't located in the office, if you're not seeing your boss on a day-to-day basis, set up a Google Meet, set up a Zoom. That is so common these days. And I think that is much more acceptable if you're not in the office every day. If you're in the office every day, you clearly should be having that in-person conversation. I think people that are making the decision to do this, maybe tend to be on the younger side of the workforce. So I don't really understand, I guess, how-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,98,2022-11-04 20:45:41
4911," A younger side of the workforce, I don't really understand, I guess, how small certain industries can be. You don't want to burn any bridges. And I think you're likely to do that if you do quit via Slack or email. It's true. I mean, you have some people just announcing that they're leaving their jobs on TikTok, which is a horrible, horrible trend, a horrible idea. But I think, as you mentioned, at least if you can't be face-to-face in person, at least over video chat. I'm not one of these horrible, sort of, mass-firing. It's just one-on-one. Just like it was when you hired the person, give them that same respect on the way out. I think that's you. I think that's the tasteful way to do it. It's not an easy conversation to ever have, but at least try and make it as respectful as you can. It'll be worth having it face-to-face. We're in agreeance on that. Hopefully, people watching also agree with that as well. All right, moving on to another story that we're watching your big day for Roku, the streaming platform, releasing its original biopic film, Weird the Ow, Yank of X Story. Yeah, we're financing this, Al Jender, Canal, it joins us now with more, and Alie, when you take a look at Roku's move here, I guess, what is this signal just in terms of its content push? This is certainly Roku's biggest original yet. It really adds to this push from the company to try its hand at original programming. You saw Daniel Rackliff just there. He is in the title role. We also have other really strong A-list stars like Evan Rachel Wood, Rain Wilson. I will say, if you think back to some of the other streaming giants, like a Netflix or an Apple TV Plus, there was always that one show, that one movie that really solidified their spot in the streaming wars, had everyone sort of look at them a little differently. This could be the thing for Roku. I remember for me for Netflix, it was Halse cards, Apple TV Plus, I think you could argue Ted Lasso. This film is a success. That could be something huge for Roku moving forward. Of course, Roku is free, so you can watch this for free, but it will have ads because Roku's business model really relies on ads. We saw that really impact earnings as you were dispensiting this past quarter. If Roku can be successful with this original content push, they can keep people within the ecosystem and really monetize that, that's more revenue opportunity for them moving forward. This could potentially be a game changer. Yeah, it couldn't really be. I will say for that weird-out movie, still hard for me to see Daniel Rackliff as anybody else on the Mid-Harris Potter, but you know- You're a man, that's my eye. That's my eye. Yeah. Now I also want to talk about James Cameron's avatar at the way of the water. That set to hit theaters December 16th. Now, 20th Century Studios releasing the official trailer. Take a listen. So what does her heart beat sound like? Mighty. Now it does look gorgeous, but it is long. So Ali, do you expect Avatar the way of the water to be a box office blowout? I really do. I mean, this film takes place 10 years from where the original film left off. And of course, it's been 13 years since we first saw the original movie. That's why theaters have been re-releasing it in theaters. And that's actually been very successful. It's added to box office gains. So even though this is a 13-year-old movie, people are still going to the theater. They want to refresh their memory so that they are fully prepared for when this sequel debuts on December 16th. When I went to Disney's D23 convention, they actually showed five very long clips of this. And I got to say, people were owing and awing. The film was very excited in the crowd. The cinematography was amazing. James Cameron, he really wanted this film to debut in a theater. He wanted to wait until the technology was there. So I think there's a lot of hype around this film. And I certainly think it's going to be one of the biggest movies, probably the biggest movie of the year. Of course, it will follow Marvel's Wakanda forever. So just a lot to look forward to at the box office as we round out 2023. And it will set us up for hopefully the successful 2024 because we are still below pre-pandemic levels. We'll see how the way of water can add to those. I mean, I will say it's visually stunning. If there's ever a movie you're going to want to see on the big screen, it does seem to be this. Three hours, though. I don't know if you'd want to bring the kids. We already saw it with the Irishman and things like that. People are having to watch it. We're going to focus on the process we set the speaker in on both of the forwards. We are not going to force those thoughts on theopes of leads, not to every second for a unseren or 다른 issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,99,2022-11-04 20:50:12
4912," Bix, we need does seem to be this. Three hours though, I don't know if you'd want to bring the kids. You know, we already saw it with the Irishman. It's like that people are having to watch it in segments just so they can get through it. Three hours is a pretty long time. It took me three days to watch the Irishman. I totally, I don't know if that speaks to my attention span or the quality of the film. I don't really know. But yes, it is a long movie. I do think our attention spans a short end. We'll see, but I don't think that's going to stop people for this one. I don't know, Shana. I feel like people are ready for it. I think people who saw the first avatar will be very excited to return to the theaters. I also think they have a massive selling point in. If you watch this at home, it simply is not the same experience. You need to watch it in theaters. I think it's going to be a massive, massive thing. Thank you. We'll see. All right, Ali, can I have a good weekend? All right, coming up next. You've got one in 292 million, that's all chance, of winning the Power Ball tomorrow night. And maybe tiny, but that's still a chance. So if you do win, what next? We'll tell you exactly what to do when we come back. Thank you. $1.6 billion. That's the power of Jackpot. Now making it the largest on record. And of course you still have plenty of time to buy a ticket ahead of the drawing tomorrow nights. So what happens if you strike it big? Or Wells Fargo, Wealth and Investment Managing Director Emily Irwin joined us now with a look at what to do if you're lucky enough to win big. So obviously a lot of people get very excited about this but it's important to have a plan in place. Talk about some of the initial steps people should be taking. Absolutely. And thank you for having me. The first thing to really consider is putting a communication plan in place. And that communication plan is comprised of with whom are you going to share this big news when and how.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,100,2022-11-04 20:54:39
4913," really consider is putting a communication plan in place. And that communication plan is comprised of with whom are you going to share this big news, when and how. And so thinking about the who, friends and family, keeping that circle tight and close, and ensuring that no one's going to share the news on your behalf is key. Secondly, you want to comprise a team. And thinking about assembling that team, you very often can have up to a year to claim that powerball ticket. And so thinking about that team to help you buy some time, considering how to take the payments, thinking about an attorney, an accountant, a charitable advisor, as well as an investment advisor. And then finally, how are you going to share the news? After you determine that it's the time to go claim your winnings, are you going to be able to minimize any scammers by ensuring some privacy, this is very state by state, but this is certainly not the time to post yourself in your winning ticket on social media. Emily, and then of course you have the massive decision or whether you should go with the lump sum, which in this case would be right around $782 million, or if you should opt for that yearly payout. What should people consider? And I guess what advice do you have for that lucky winner if you do get a winner in this drawing? Well, when you're thinking about the lump sum, of course, you're going to have more control over how you invest those assets. And for many, that is critical to their decision making. They like the assuriveness that they're going to receive those winnings and be able to determine how to invest or spend them over the years. By contrast, if you're someone who you have a dollar in your pocket and you're going to spend it, an annuity might be a better strategy for you. Or if you're someone that you think you're going to have a hard time saying no, whether it's to friends or family or organizations, you might want a little bit more peace of mind knowing that every single time that your calendar turns over, you're going to be receiving another payment. And so I think part of it is behavioral finance. How do you interact with your finances? And part of it is how much control do you want? And how much do you want to have that money now versus having it doled out over a number of years? So really have to understand your financial personality before making a decision like this. Now, obviously, we read a lot of heartbreaking stories about people who won the lottery and end up going bankrupt, going broke. What are some of the mistakes that people should really try and avoid? What are some of the don'ts? Yeah, unfortunately, there are those individuals that that winning ticket is something they wish they never had in their hand. And so some best practices are put a plan in place and put a budget in place, as insane as that sounds. For someone who's going to win that ticket, this will very likely catapult them into a different financial stratosphere. Not only what are the outlays of cash that they expect over the next few years, but what are the ongoing maintenance costs of those types of expenses? And it might be something that they're not used to, a financial plan or an investment plan with scenarios and analysis supporting all of their wishes and goals can really help bring some dollars and cents to maybe some of their hopes. And then secondly, thinking about ways to really communicate with those around you as you may be seen as a bank within your community going forward, making sure that you have some sort of a mission statement or a intentional giving statement. So you have the flexibility and peace of mind to be able to say yes and say no as you're approached by different individuals and organizations. All right, Emily Irwin. Emily, real quick, are you playing? Absolutely. I already have my tickets. Oh, good. Good for you. I was going to have to run out and buy one. All right, Emily Irwin, great to have you. Richelle, how about you? Absolutely. I bought my ticket yesterday. I'm not fooling around with the rush today. I was like, I bought mine. I'm ready. What would you spend it on if you won it? I don't know. I don't know what happens for now. That's the thing long and hard about it. I don't think there's any huge purchase I would make right away. I think it's worth support. You've got to save. You've got to save for the future. All right, well, that does it for us today. And yeah, we'll find the insight.
