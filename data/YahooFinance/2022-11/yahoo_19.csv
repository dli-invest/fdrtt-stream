4813," or in tune to draft kings here. That's a simple DK NG in tune to it because of the sports fandom here. You're seeing those shares down by about 16 and a half percent after posting a loss of dollar per share for the quarter. And despite topping revenue estimates that's working in the company, saw net interest expense losses grow heavily from last year for draft kings. This is a good time to be a sports fan in Philadelphia, but also who's looking across the number of different sports that there are more opportunities to bet on. And it's a larger question of where draft kings may be able to move forward even with their partnerships, ESPN and draft kings. That was a huge conversation at least in terms of the reports that were emerging that they may be looking for a tie up somewhere. And that would be, I think, incrementally incredible opportunity for them to tap into, especially with the amount of broadcasting that they would have access into there. Yeah, a little bit surprised by the market reaction. This was a pretty good quarter. User metrics look strong. They also paired their loss expectations for the year, but maybe it's just the market wanting some signal of when this company might turn profits. Maybe so. I don't know. Like I said, a lot of them are paying attention to EBITDA numbers as well, and that's sort of not... I don't know. I don't know what's going on with draft kings either. Well, it's such a massive cost for them to take on customers. The customer acquisition costs and the marketing expenses that are company in draft kings or any of the different sports books that have a mobile first approach. They've got to spend a ton of money just to get people on the platform and then retain the 1.6 million average monthly, unique paying BTC customers as draft king classifies them. That was an increase of 22%, but the expenses on the other side too, just to get new customers that continue to come in and offer them money to bet on the platform first out, that they have to put out there on the table as well. This was what I was fumbling around trying to find. I was saying that a lot of investors are focusing on the EBITDA on the cash flow number for these companies, and that forecast is bad. That's what I was fumbling around to say. The company says, for 2023, it's adjusted EBITDA loss will be $475 to $575 million. Analysts have been looking for a loss of $426 million. So even on that adjusted EBITDA basis, the company is looking for wider losses than have been forecast. So that is the problem here that they're maybe not pushing at least in the vague direction of profitability as quickly as the street wants to. So draft king's fumbling before football Sunday. There you go. There you go. You're at the headline. I know we got to go to break, but one other number that could be an interesting kind of consumer budget tightening indicator from draft king's moving forward is this average revenue per user, per monthly, unique pay, or at least $100 in the third quarter. And that is an increase year over year, 114%. But if you eventually see that start to turn down, that could mean that some of the users are tightening how much they're willing to gamble and put out there in the sports betting market. And what's the cost of acquiring that customer? I'm betting both of you getting yelled at right now in the selection. Yeah, we probably are right now. Yeah, coming up. We're going to stop getting yelled at. Coming up on the other side, the short break. Yahoo, fine, this is Jared Blickery. Gonna break down the latest market action on the back of the October jobs report. That's next, sorry, I'm against it. Music",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,1,2022-11-04 13:42:02
4814," she We're taking a look at the major averages this morning on this jobs day in America that Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. They're all in positive territory all by nearly a percent on the Dow. It's up by about nine cents a percent and then fractional gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Let's get on over to the Wi-Fi Interactive Zoom in this morning to Jared Blickery. This is Rob's Day in America. I'm hearing a James Brown tune in my head living in America. Let's go to the board here. S&P 500, up about nine tenths of a percent. Let's check out the five day price action still hovering around the bottom end of the range there kind of digesting that news that we got from the Fed and Chair Powell on Wednesday. I want to take a look at a longer term view of the S&P 500. This is three months. Market is behaving very technically. This is in contrast to what we had most of the summer, even in a lot of September. I'm drawing these lines here 50 percent and that's called the halfway back of that movement right there. 3,900 huge, huge level here. We stopped there for a few days, sold off, but guess what? We hit the 50 percent retracement the halfway back of this bullish movement. Now we have retraced to the 50 percent. You get the picture here. So basically the market is coiling for a big move. We don't necessarily know where that is going to go next, but I do want to show you what has been happening in the bond market. Here's a five year Tino yield hovering near decade-old highs. It's down just marginally here. 10 year Tino yield up about two basis points. So not too much movement in reaction to the payrolls report. Then we have the US dollar index. That had been a little bit stronger early after the report, but now it is shifting down strongly. So that's kind of sending the opposite reaction that we might have expected. And I just want to point out that, remember a few weeks back CPI came out. It was expected to be a very bearish reaction in the market because it was a bearish print. But guess what? We rallied that day. If it's the same thing going on, we might expect something kind of a bullish reversal in the future. Let's talk about China stocks for a minute, Jared, because there are still some reports percolating about what a wind down of the zero COVID policy or softening of it would look like. It would look like this writ large because you're seeing a lot of dark green on the screen. Oli Baba, 4.5% Lee Auto, 9%. All of these stocks have been hit if not absolutely obliterated, not only in the last year, but the last two to three years. So we're seeing a lot of red here. This is a year to day look here. But nevertheless, take a look at the five day price action. We're seeing some movements, some positive development on this front. China is still a huge wild card. But I got to say in the midst of all this uncertainty, if in fact China were to give definitive inklings, not inklings, definitive motion towards a reopening, towards an end of the zero COVID policy. Guess what, guys, I think that could provide the bullish impotent for the market, for the S&P 500, you get above 3,900 and for that short covering route.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,2,2022-11-04 13:46:07
4815," I guess what guys, I think that could provide the bullish impotent for the market, for the S&P 500 you get above $3,900 and for that short covering rally, a lot of traders are expected. All right, Blickery, thanks so much. All right, Ms. Ernie's estimates and serve up we've got and set your own risk according to the spoke. There have been 20 stocks that have fallen 20% plus on their earnings report this season. Only 10 companies have gained 20% plus on their earnings reports. Coming up, we'll get more commentary on that October at Johns Report when Goldman Sacks is for pre-gill on the other side of the brick. As we've been discussing job growth remains strong in October, stoking fears around continuing inflation and more importantly continued interest rate increases because earlier this week, Jay Powell, chair of the Fed, described the labor market as overheated without any real signs of softening. Thank you for being here. Thank you. gain in non-farm payroll employment, exceeded expectations, but actually if you look on a historical basis, when you are in a tight labour market, companies tend to pull forward their hiring for the festive season, so that might explain the beat on non-farm payrolls relative to expectations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,3,2022-11-04 13:50:30
4816," a tight labour market, companies tend to pull forward their hiring for the festive seasons, that might explain the beat on non-pronged payrolls relative to expectations. And then when you looked at the uptake in the unemployment rate, that was in part due to developments on labour force participation, but that data tends to be very volatile. So I don't think it is a game changer between now and the December meeting. We have two more CPI inflation prints and another labour market report. So that is the sort of top tier data that financial markets are going to be focused on. Gryffrey, is a recession the only thing that might bring people who have been on the sidelines of labour force participation back into the workforce? Well, the issues between labour supply are varied. So there was a structural element to it, prior to the pandemic, the US had lower male labour force participation relative to other advanced economies for various reasons. As a result of the pandemic, as I'm sure you're well aware, some people are excited to the workforce for childcare reasons, addressing that requires structural reform and policy. Some people like in the UK, for example, are out with long-term sick due to COVID. Again, there's a lot of uncertainty around that. I wouldn't say that you necessarily need a recession to improve labour force participation. There are other ways to do that. But big picture in the near term, the rebalancing of the labour market that is needed to bring inflation back to inflation target consistent levels is going to require a reduction in labour demand because policy makers have sort of given up hope on the improvement in labour supply. And that's why we're very focused on what happens with job openings and what's happening in the labour market reports. Grapri, how do you think the bond market will react in front of what looks to be another series of rate hikes coming? Well, what's interesting is an analyst in my team is looking at fixed income spread markets in response to the four-fed 75 basis points rate hikes. And we've actually seen that those risk assets largely become acclimatized to this pace of rate increases and it was well-flagged. And in July, actually, you saw a rally because there were hopes of a bad policy pivot. So I think lots of lots will depend on those three P's that everybody is focused on right now, which is the prospect of a pivot and the pace of rate hikes and that peak in the policy terminal rate. We think that the bed there is increased prospect of a downshift to 50 basis points and we're going to move towards a slower pace of tightening but potentially for longer. And that's actually consistent with past developed market central bank hiking cycles. In our view, actually, the rapid repricing in bonds at the front end is largely behind us and actually we think it's a very opportunistic environment for investors to add exposure to high quality short-uration bonds lending to a high quality company or government for a short period of time is a very attractive alternative to the still very low rates that retail investors earn on bank deposits. That's interesting, Geprita. And when we look at the benchmark tenure, for example, how should we think about the relationship between the yield there and the Fed funds target rate? In other words, for example, if the terminal rate is 5% what would that imply for the tenure? Well, we're in an environment where they are both sick equal developments at play in terms of what the Fed is doing to cool the economy to address inflation. And that is impacting the US yield curve and US rates. But big picture were also contending with structural inflation forces that imply that inflation is going to be higher than the last cycle. And so I would say where rates ultimately settle is still in flux. We like the policy makers have to be very data dependent. We have to be humble in our outlook and very nimble in adjusting our views and our expectations based on what the data is telling us. But I would say we do think that we are going to be transitioning into a higher inflation environment for investors. The last cycle was all about low rates and this view of there is no alternative to riskier higher yielding assets. But now we actually think it is time to bring on bonds or bonds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,4,2022-11-04 13:54:34
4817," and this view of there is no alternative to riskier higher yielding assets. But now we actually think it is time to bring on bonds or Bob. So Tina's giving way to Bob and there are opportunities in high quality short duration assets like I mentioned. But until we reach peak policy hawkishness, we do not think it is wise to have long-awakeration exposures. Copy that. Thanks so much, Grapri, good to get your perspective on this important day. Goldman Sachs, Assets, Management, Global Fixed Income and macro strategist, Grapri Gill, thank you and we'll be right back. Let's get another check on markets here. Now we are almost 90 minutes after the jobs report and just about 30 after the opening bell this morning. It stops already giving up some of their gains that we saw out of the gate here this morning after the jobs report showed a gain of 2,000, 1,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked up a little bit to 3.7%. But we do see stocks pairing their advance. Earlier we saw major averages up more than 1%. Now the NASDAQ which I have been leading is up just about 2 thirds of 1%. Coming up, what do those October jobs numbers mean for unions? We are going to speak with the president of SEIU International and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.

I'm Brian Sasi, once I Julie Hymon and Brad Smith, U.S. economy added, 261,000 jobs in October, the unemployment rate coming in at 3.7% better than expected showing continued resilience in the U.S. labor market. And for the latest pulse on U.S. workers, we have U.S. labor secretary Marty Walsh joining us very shortly. And a tale of two fintechs, PayPal and Blocks spending different stories for investors, Alan's Mark Palmer will join us to break down the earnings parade. And later on, we'll dive into Funko, a shares crater following its latest quarterly report. First, let's get to Brad at the Wi-Fi, Interactive Brad. All right, let's take a look at the Dow Jones industrial average kick things off. At this, the top of the 10am hour on this Friday, congrats. You've made it to the end of the week here. Dow Jones is up by about 1% right now. Nasdaq composite, you're seeing that higher by a little more than 1% as well, the SCP-500. You're also seeing that hold on to gains by about 1.1%. Let's just put this in a five-day context to see how the week is rounding out. Overall, S&P 500 over the past five days still lower by about 3.5%. Nasdaq composite, that too in the red. Actually, the deepest decline of the U.S. major averages this week. And then additionally, you're seeing the Dow Jones industrial average over the past five days still lower. So, we've got solid movement at least to end out this trading week. And that's on the back of today's jobs report. Also, taking a look first at the sectors. And I'll come back to this retail and apparel segment for a hot second in a moment. But the sector activity that we're seeing here on the day, we've gotten a little more mixed. And actually, now we have more laggards than advances here. Take a look. Energy is up 3% here on the day. And actually, let's put this in an intraday view. And now we're in the correct correlation there to today's activity. We've got a total of 11 S&P 500 sectors in positive territory. And then just briefly going back to those apparel names that we've been tracking. As there's been some fresh news out of Adidas, as they've named a new CEO. Beyond Golden, going to become the CEO of Adidas. And so Adidas is up by about 14% right now. At least the shares that trade overseas are right now. So we'll continue to watch that. But moving forward here on the day, the U.S. has added 261,000 jobs in October while unionizing efforts continue to make its way through the labor market.

4819," Added 261,000 jobs in October while unionizing efforts continue to make its way through the labor market. Starbucks made one of many companies all too familiar with workers unionization efforts. Here's what's the F.O. Rachel Regieri had to say on the matter. We truly believe a side-by-side relationship with our partner is the very best path forward, but we respect the process. What we're focused on is continuing to create the very best experience for our partners. We know that that has worked for the last 50 years and we're confident it actually underpins the success of our new era of growth. So that's where we're focused. And to take a closer look at the labor movement in the U.S. and workers' rights, we have Mary Kay Henry, International President of the Service Employees International Union. Thank you so much for taking the time here with us this morning. First and foremost, just got a get your reaction to what you heard from the Starbucks CFO. Well, if that was the case, then workers would be at a bargaining table and being able to have a say directly on the job. And instead, the Starbucks is choosing to fight tooth and nail closed stores when people unionize. And we really welcomed the day when the CFO's comments are the reality with Starbucks because the partners love that company. And they want to see it at the table and a voice on the job and to be respected, protected, and paid what their worth. Mary Kay, Julie, I'm curious if you've ever had an experience where a company has said, come on in. Yes, we're happy to have union to your, let's go. I mean, is it much more than norm to have more of an adversarial relationship? Well, there's been periods in American history where employers have said, come on in. When Kaiser Permanente was founded in the 40s in California, it opened as a healthcare provider that all the jobs were union. And today they have the highest patient satisfaction and the employee satisfaction in the healthcare sector. Harley Davidson, it was a conflict with those workers, but now the United Steel workers and Harley Davidson have a very good relationship and the company's profitable. So it's true. I think what you're saying, the norm in the U.S. economy is for corporations to resist workers who want to join together. And we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that I believe are driving wages up, even though wage growth is slowing as we have this terrific jobs report this month. And I think that's why we're going to continue to see workers joining together at Starbucks, Amazon, fast food, airports, and across the service and care sector because people want to turn poverty wage jobs into good jobs that they can raise their families on. Mary Kay, what would getting it right look like for Starbucks? Are you talking $25 an hour and guaranteed 40 hours a week? Well, getting it right would be recognizing the union at the 250 stores that have already voted to join the union and allowing workers who want to file for elections. The ability to do it without their managers interfering with it or changing their schedules or moving people around stores. The continued anti-union campaign should stop. That would be a way to get it right. And then ultimately, it would be terrific if Starbucks would break with major corporations in the U.S. and do what they do in other countries around the world and set a national bargaining table where there could be a standard as you're suggesting that the workers and the corporation could figure out together. This is in a climate where corporate profits are at an all-time high, highest in 70 years. And so that's why I think the Starbucks and Amazon organizing is connected to the economic health of major corporations here in this country and around the world. And it's why things would go so much better if employers would stop resisting the union and start respecting the right of workers to decide for themselves whether they want to be in a union. Well, it's also driven by the workers shortage, right? That, you know, it's hard to find people to feel those positions. And so we've seen this period of a little bit more of the power being.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,7,2022-11-04 14:07:33
4820," on a B and a union. Well, it's also driven by the workers shortage, right? That, you know, it's hard to find people to fill those positions. And so we've seen this period of a little bit more of the power being put back in the workers' hands. But that might be about to shift again, right? If we're heading into a recession, if we are going to see the job market sort of turn around in the next year or so, could that also change the dynamics for unions? You know, I actually think what's driving workers to join together in unions is beyond the shortage and is about the two-year pandemic that people just work their way through and had the experience of their co-workers get hardest hit by the pandemic because people were showing up every day, often without the personal protective equipment they needed. And I think when people continue to work and we're facing life and death choices, I've heard this directly from nurses, retail workers, fast-food workers, they decided that when their employer started to resist them and threaten their job, it was like, okay, if you're going to threaten to fire me, after I just spent two years risking my life to show up to work, then I probably don't need this job. And that's why I'm going to join together with my co-workers and create a collective bargaining agreement so that workers can be respected on the job, protected in their health, and paid what they're worth. Mary Kay Henry, SEIU, International President, good to see you. Have a great weekend. Thank you. All right, the U.S. economy created 261,000 jobs in the month of October. Let's get more of a pulse on the jobs market with U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. Marty, always good to see you here this morning. You're taking these job numbers. I mean, certainly, the good job numbers were low unemployment. I like seeing that every month. And what was starting to see, I think, is nice as a slow-steady growth in our economy. And I think that we're not getting, certainly, the slowdown that a lot of people want to see, or alleging they need to bring the inflationary pressures down. But I think we are sat in the sea slow-steady growth that we move forward here. Do you believe that we'll see more people come back into the workforce, those who have perhaps sat on the sideline for one reason or another, whether that's childcare, or whether that's the coronavirus pandemic and workplace issues, whatever that may be, that they'll start to come back into the workforce. If we do see a deep recession, or at least a more pronounced recession. I think we'll definitely see more people go back into the workforce. I mean, there's lots of job openings in the country right now. And we were talking about that this morning, what I went out of the office and BLS, just to see where the job openings are. And when you think about job openings, the largest job openings in our country are in lower paying jobs. They're in hospitality industries. And yet, we're sat in the sea people come back into the workforce. And they have higher skills and degrees, and they're looking to get into better paying jobs. So right now, as we move forward here, we've got to make sure we're partnering jobs with people and what their ability to do is. And I think that that's something that we have to really think about moving forward. At least that's what I'm thinking about moving forward here at the Department of Labor. Marty, maybe some of those people going to be in these jobs will be laid off software engineers. I don't know, because we're hearing about, or people who are looking for job in that sector. And there's not that job anymore. We're hearing about a lot of tech companies that are either cutting or freezing hiring right now. There's just a report that Elon Musk, now that he owns Twitter, is going to cut 3,700 people there. I know that you had talked to Musk in the past regarding his build out in Texas for Tesla. Now he's cutting jobs in his other business and his newly acquired business. I'm just curious what you think about that sort of flow of jobs there. Well, certainly, one thing in this jobs report, that's not reflected yet in this. And certainly I'm keeping a close eye on that, because I dig the tech sector in the United States over the last several years, certainly has grown. And those are good paying jobs. And those are jobs that are in lots of cities like Austin, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, out in New York and Chicago, places like that. So I have to dive into that a little more. We haven't seen, I don't think a lot of life, actually, but there's been lots of talk of layoffs and freezing hiring. So certainly that's something that would concern me, because they have good paying jobs. And a lot of states and cities and places around the country have built out expansion of their cities, whether building new housing, things like that. It's for this exact sector, this tech sector. So it's something.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,8,2022-11-04 14:12:03
4821," A lot of states and cities and places around the country have built out expansion of their cities, whether building new housing, things like that. It's for this exact sector, this tech sector. So it's something that I'm interested in. I'm going to dive more into and certainly offering right now to any tech company out there, anything that we can do at the Department of Labor to help you in a situation. I'd love to do that. As far as Twitter, I mean, that's a whole different situation. I think that's, I don't know enough about it, but I think that's Elon Musk in looking at the business model. I'm sure at some point that will fix itself out as it moves forward. While we have you, we do know that there's been a move from New York City, this recent, of course, in the salary transparency that's come forward. And regardless of what started, it's gotten off to. I think there is still this broader recognition that there can be more room for salary transparency that is beneficial to both the employee and the employer. What would you like to see on that front as New York City has already rolled this out, perhaps where some other cities and states could also have that type of transparency that leads to a more healthy employer employee relationship and kind of reduces some of the parity issues in pay scale? Yeah. Well, we did that in Boston. When I was the mayor of Boston, we had 200 companies in the city that gave us the pay data. And anonymously, we were able to dissect it and really work on pay equity and making sure that women and men would pay the same. We made some really good gains in the city of Boston. It wasn't heavy handed. The companies came to the table. These are the large corporations. And I think having these conversations are really important. And coming up with policies moving forward are important. We were successful in the city of Boston. They're still, hopefully still doing it in the city of Boston. But in other places, it really is about having these conversations and not just to pay equity and transparency, but also in leadership of companies and getting women on boards and things like that. And all of those important aspects of growth and moving forward, legislation has passed often about pay equity. We shouldn't, women shouldn't need legislation to be paid the same as a man. Women should be paid the same as a man for doing the same exact work. And that's something that not just elected officials, but CEOs of companies should work on. With 2022, the time has come to make equity in the workplace consistent. Mr. Secretary, this jobs report just continues a string of really solid, to strong labor market reports, but it comes against the backdrop of slowing or declining productivity in this country. I do you think the hustle culture this country was founded on is just done? Yeah, my economy just, they went over that with me yesterday. And I was trying to get a good reason on how we measure productivity in the United States America. And I think that we're still working through that. I mean, I think the productivity America is strong. I think that when the terminology of quite quits came up or all of that happening, I never heard it in the communities. I haven't heard it when I was out there talking. I think American workers are still working strong. They're working, getting paid, but on a lot of construction sites, I've been in a lot of manufacturing facilities. Those workers aren't slowing down. Those workers are working hard. So I think that, again, I don't know enough about the data. I don't think the data is consistent or strong as it should be, to really tell the true story of American workers. All right. The US Labor Secretary, Mari Warsh, always good to see you. Have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. And we'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,9,2022-11-04 14:16:27

Saudi Arabia's public investment fund or PIF says it will make electric cars in the kingdom under a joint venture with Apple supplier FoxCarn. That's part of a push to build new industries and lessen the nation's dependence on oil. FoxCarn will develop the electrical architecture of the vehicles and seer will be the name of the first Saudi automotive brand to produce electric vehicles in Saudi Arabia. The PIF said its cars would be available in 2025 and seer is projected to contribute 8 billion dollars to the kingdom's GDP by 2034. Chrysler parent Stellantis warning nearly 300,000 vehicle owners immediately to stop driving their cars after three crash deaths tied to faulty ticata airbaggin-flaters were reported in the last seven months. The do not drive warning is currently in place for owners of previously recalled 2005 to 2010 Dodge Magnum station wagon, Dodge Challenger Coops, and Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans that had not addressed that airbag issue. And Aldi is doing a Thanksgiving price rewind in an effort to draw customers to its chain amid surging inflation. The grocery retailer lowered prices for its Thanksgiving dinner food items to match 2019 prices. That means discounts of up to 30% for select items. If you recall, we reported earlier this week that Walmart announced a similar pricing strategy, but they're just rolling it back to last year's prices. That would be in about a 15% discount. So Aldi saying, no, no, no, we're going all the way back to 2019. Hold my perky. Wait a minute. Something like that. Hold the gravy, whatever. Anyway, it has been a rough year for the semiconductor sector. First companies such as AMD and Nvidia could not get enough chips to supply customers. And now slowing PC sales are hurting the industry. Shares of chip makers, they've been sliding all year and it could give worse. Sazzy is here with his take on this one. Yeah, nothing like dumping this negativity on a day when all the chip stocks are up. And nonetheless, highlighting a good note from cities, Chris Daly.

That PC correction is alive and well and it has been very ugly for a lot of players. And even too, the handset market as well has been correcting as we learned from Qualcomm's warning yesterday. And then lastly, companies are more tightly managing capital expenditures. It is full on. It continues to be budget planning season in corporate America. And we're starting to see a lot of, I would just say tighter cap X budgets for next year. Maybe that means a fewer less chips. Now of course, there you can see that affiliate, I'll see a semiconductor index on the screen right there. That has been, it has not been a good year for that, not a good year for an AMD and Nvidia, many other players in that semiconductor index. Daily things, EPS, estimates for chip stocks can tank at least another 20% from where they are now. That would be a big plunge and likely put further pressure to his point on the stocks. And that the stocks index could plunge at least 15% as those earnings estimates come down. And might take here, in search of bottom, it definitely brings up a couple good points on what would ultimately cause that bottom in chip stocks. For him, it is the end market no longer correcting, valuation just reaching levels that are truly trough and no more cap X cuts. And I'm trying to figure out why I'm in a basket. Is that what that is? I think that's a basket of trash can. It's a trash can. Wow. That's a waste. That's a waste. That's not a waste. That's all. That's all. It looks like a wicker basket, like a laundry wicker basket. Yes, so if it's a trash can. I feel like I should. I know who made it and it's a trash can. It's a trash can. Okay. Well, we'll see what happens with chips. I mean, it depends on the time horizon you look at. Because it's interesting when you talk to some investors and they say chips obviously are still going to meet them. Yes. And so if you're an investor who's looking at five years, ten years, you might have, if you have that luxury, you might have a different sort of assessment here of what this group looks like. Yeah. Look, AMD's business is still growing. Qualcomm is still growing. It's just a matter of they're not growing at the rates that they were and the growth rates have really, really, really stalled. I think that Qualcomm report was just not good on many accounts this week. Yeah. And it's a lot of things, many of which you pointed out and you're taking today's side. I was appreciated. Guys, coming up, payment platform, round up. We're going to break down the earnings from Block and Paypal with BTIG's Mark Palmer. That's coming up next. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,11,2022-11-04 14:25:14
4824," // Ritual DistANK sucks shit out of reach Payment platforms block and PayPal. They are on the move today, but in divergent ways after PayPal cut its full year revenue forecast while blocked. So 51% pop in its cash at business year over year. D have, it is offering a bank account substitute to consumers, particularly in the lower end of the income spectrum, who really benefit from those types of services, especially to time when a lot of banks focusing on their own profitability are growing up the gates and letting less consumers to start bank accounts within their platforms. So it's got a mission critical functionality while at the same time it's seller ecosystem, which is basically allowing points of sale payments, has remained robust, which we believe is largely because the company is offering tools to small businesses and medium-sized businesses that enable them to better manage their payment needs. Mark, it's Julie here, it's good to see you, talk to me about CashApp versus Venmo because I sort of think of those in the same bucket, although I know CashApp has broader applications. Is CashApp taking share from Venmo, or is it just expanding the pie entirely and signing up different and new customers? Yeah, we believe there are very different use cases for Venmo versus CashApp. Venmo historically had more of a social element, it has more of a focus on a somewhat higher income demographic than does CashApp. So it doesn't really serve as a bank account substitute the same way that CashApp does. And one of the things that we really saw in the third quarter was block really leaning into the banking functionality associated with CashApp, and we expect that to continue making it even more relevant to the lives of the people who are using it. Mark, the last time I caught up with the PayPal team, they were pitching the story of expense reduction and a pivot in operating margins next year. I mean, do you agree with that? And if so, what does that pivot look like? Well, we agree that they're pivoting. If you look at PayPal today versus where it had been a couple of years ago, the orientation is just very different. A couple of years ago, the focus was on ubiquity. It was on customer acquisition. It was on the top line growth. And this is how PayPal became a stock that was trading at north of 60 times earnings. Flash forward to today, and we see a stock that's trading at a below market multiple, somewhere around 16 times earnings or a little bit below that. The reality is that PayPal has pivoted toward being what we believe to be more of a mature model, focusing not on customer acquisition, but on increasing penetration of existing customers, cutting costs to drive the bottom line. These things are crumpled in an uncertain...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,12,2022-11-04 14:29:18
4825," but on increasing penetration of existing customers, cutting costs to drive the bottom line, these things are crudent in an uncertain, macroeconomic environment, but they don't represent the characteristics of the growth stock that PayPal had been a couple of years ago. What kind of growth gets evaporated when you layer in an Apple Pay and any continue furthering of their own Fintech ambitions as well? Yeah, you know, it's interesting because one of the things that PayPal has done historically is rather than try to fight some of the big tech titans who were getting into payments, they've collaborated with them. You know, we saw this with their tie ups with Visa and Mastercard a few years back. You know, more recently now we're seeing PayPal collaborating with the lakes of Amazon and Apple, trying to maintain their relevance and frankly, we believe that the announcements that the company made with regard to you being able to integrate Apple's tap to pay, things of this nature are making its payment functionality more robust, but when you back up and look at the bigger picture, the question is how is this company going to be able to sustain growth? They're guiding initially to 15% earnings growth in 2023, but at the same time, they're making a lot of statements about the vulnerability of their end consumer to an uncertain macroeconomic environment, thus putting that 15% growth in a very risky position right out of the bat. Mark, you're out here this morning keeping your buy rating on Coinbase F their earnings last night, but taking your price target to $110 from 220, when will this company live up to its promise? Well, I think that's largely a function of what's going to happen in the end market. Coinbase can and is setting itself, but it can't control the wind. And the wind in this case is the crypto market, which is very much correlated with risk assets in general and as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten, the outlook there is very much uncertain. So what are we seeing? We're seeing Coinbase preserve its optionality by focusing on maintaining a large cash balance, building out its institutional crime brokerage platform, and continuing to add new functionality and areas like staking that are relevant to those in the crypto space. So I think what we are seeing now is a lot of building that's going on not only in Coinbase, but among Web 3 platforms in general, in anticipation of getting a bit more of a tailwind so that you can see the full realization of the platform's potential. BTIG, managing director, Mark Palmer, always good to see you. Have a good weekend. It's a talk to you. Coming up, what's on tap for Disney's earnings next week? We'll break down you top three things you need to know next. Thanks for watching.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,13,2022-11-04 14:33:42
4826," Dear happiness. between today's class or Shares of Corona are getting run over after posting a wireland expected loss for the third quarter. I mean, it's softening demand for pre-owned vehicles. Product supermaid joins us now. Pros not a good quarter from Carvana, but again, more pressure on the shares here. Yeah, it seems like these high rates are really hurting there. You know, most people with Binance, there's their cars, 40 million Americans buy used cars every year. Carvana, I'm gonna tell you about how this is a rate-sensitive kind of purchase. Like he said, big miss on the top and bottom line. Gross proper vehicle down a thousand bucks year over year. That's a huge kind of like decrease in your profit margin there. So, you know, they said things would get worse for them to get any better. So there's not much there for them to kind of like hopefully hang their head on soon. But, and then in the ice going to the cake is they suspended their guidance, right? So they can't kind of see what's next, given how uncertain things are. So, you know, the Carvana business model has been hurting all year, right? As we've sort of seen things kind of slow down, rates go up. And the question is, is this rock bottom and then are they going to kind of like, you know, it's a good product, right? It's a really easy thing people like buying their cars online. So it's like it's got value that the question is, can they make it a profitable venture? We also saw some news this morning that Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, their selling shares of a China-based EV maker. So can you tell us more about that? So many years ago, BYD, Berkshire bought a pretty significant stake in BYD by 20%. They've held on for about 10 years and they started selling little slivers of it. Starting this late this summer. This is the third, I believe third sale they've done. Another, I think I believe another three million shares here. They sold about a million and a half also in September. So it's still, they sold over 200 million shares. So it's still like a significant kind of holding. But the question is, is Warren ready to kind of exit this? If they made a lot of money off this stake, they bought it for 225 million, I think 10 years ago. And now it's over 10 years ago. And now it's worth 7 million, I think. So the question is, when is it time to exit? Does it see as a long-term Buffett player? Is it time to sort of like re-evaluate? Interesting. We saw those shares rallying just now along with other Chinese stocks during the session. So interesting. Thanks, boss. Appreciate it. And also looking ahead to the Walt Disney Company next week at Central Port Earnings. We see the shares up about 1.5% or so today. There is a lot going on when it comes to Disney from the parks around the world. Remember, we just had reports of Shanghai Disney being shut for a bit because of COVID there to the streaming landscape here in the US a lot to consider. And considering all of it, is our Alexander going to have things here with us unsaid? Hey, Ali, so what's the sort of big picture numbers you're going to be looking for? Well, clearly we learned a lot from Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount. When it comes to the state of the market right now, obviously the weakening ad market impacting their bottom line. I expect that to happen to Disney a little bit, but this company has a lot of levers to pull. I spoke with Tim Nolan from McWire. He reiterated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% of your to date, but you didn't know that over the long term this company has a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,14,2022-11-04 14:38:13
4827," He's tolerated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% year to date, but he did note that over the long term this company has a lot to look forward to. What you're looking on your screen now is a Wall Street projections. Revenue expected to come in at 21.27 billion, adjust the DPS of 51 cents, parks experiences and consumer products revenue at 7.59 billion, but a really important number is that operating income. 1.9 billion is expectation. That's less than what we saw in the third quarter, but we could see a little bit of an impact from Hurricane E in there, perhaps some of that Shanghai Disney closures. And then those Disney plus subscribers expected to come in at 9.35 million. Now what Nolan told me to watch is that direct to consumer subscriber figure. Like I said, 9.5 million expected, along with that add to your expectation. How will that add to the company's bottom line? Nolan estimated that add revenues could surge up to 800 million in 2023 thanks to Disney plus. That's sort of the overall market opportunity there. And then on the park side, you wanna make sure that gross bookings aren't going down that there's no recessionary impact. The analyst pointed out that in 2009, the last financial crisis, park revenue fell 7%. But there's a bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases, to prices, updates to the park, the Genie Plus app, et cetera. And then finally, the impact of that advertising slowdown. ESPN I think is pretty insulated from all of that. But ESPN and other big question, right? Looking forward to the company. What's the DTC future of this? Because right now it's clearly more profitable in a linear world than it is in an OTT world. But something that Bob Chapich will have to think about as well. I think there's too much optimism around Disney plus coming into the report. And keep in mind, this comes against a back to it. Look what we heard from Roku this week. A major slowdown in their business. Netflix, probably some squishy areas in its quarter as well, Power Round Plus. Now looking potentially lay people off. It hasn't been a good look in streaming. Hasn't been a good look in streaming. But Disney is not just a streaming company, right? They have a lot of different components to the business. And there's a lot of confidence that they can enter this new world and be very successful at it. If you think about advertising, Disney has a really good base in this. They've really crushed it with Hulu. They have the experience on the linear side. Unfortunately, that adds slowdown. There's not much you can do with that, right? There will be some overhang there. We'll cloud the outlook overall. But overall, I think they're in a good position. They made a lot of investments to Disney plus. We have a lot of exclusive content that's coming to that service disenchanted when the ones that I'm very excited about that's coming. And I think that content spend is going to slow down significantly over the next few quarters and the next few years. And that's going to positively impact Ipa Tess. So a lot of macro concerns, but I think for this company, they're in a really solid position moving forward. And also with Disney, there's the consideration that on the streaming side too, we could see some more focus around ad tiers at a time where Netflix is rolling out and pulled forward the timeline for themselves to launch that. And so now that we've started to see that pop up in the market and perhaps see what some reception looks like, how have the early days been for Netflix? Well, Netflix just launched their ad here in the US. Yesterday, a $6.99 price point slightly below Disney pluses upcoming ad supported tier at $7.99. It's going to be a wait and see approach. We're not going to have all the answers this quarter. I think it's going to take a few quarters so we can really see that impact. I do think across the board, streamers have been exploring price increases, Warner Brothers discovery on the earnings call last night. They actually pushed up the timeline for that combo service between HBO Max and Discovery to the spring. They said there's a lot of options with pricing sort of hinted that price increases will be coming there. And so pricing is something to really focus on when we think about all of these streaming giants. And I think that's a big component that's going to be important in the quarters to come. Look forward to Disney. Woo! Let's get it. I appreciate it. Come now, we're going to check in on the state of the restaurant industry and small business. We'll see you on software company, Lightspeed. That's next. We're going to need to get a Backer logo in here. Let'sиш up below. I'm paying aakat and am doing it to the center.

4828,"cled So, if we're coming to light speed, took a hit this quarter from macro forces, including reduced customer spend at businesses, and 4X swings hitting transaction revenue. But with light speed banking on a move up market, after seeing increased spend, can it close the sale? The shares are higher today after something yesterday following the numbers, and joining us with more is JP Chauvet. He is light speed chief executive officer. JP, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. What are you seeing amongst your clients? And we should tell viewers clients are restaurants, but other types of smaller side businesses as well. What are you hearing from them right now? Yeah, so the majority of our customers are restaurants, and retailers in the SMB space. And really what we're hearing from them, it's a unique moment in time. The post pandemic world with returned physical has created a much more complexity for their businesses, because you have the physical world meets the digital world. And also what we're seeing is that it's a, you know, cost of labor is gone up, scarcity in terms of trying to hire people, and now alluming recession. So it's a really difficult time for our customers, and for the market. And here, the only way forward for our customers is to adopt technologies like cars that can help them do more with less, and automate a lot of the manual tasks. And are they convinced of that, JP? Because as I mentioned, you all had a pretty tough quarter last quarter. You're not just selling software technology to folks. You're also selling hardware in the form of a point of sale system. And are you seeing people retrench, or is it just a matter of seeing slower growth? No, so, depends what you call slower growth. We had a 38% growth the year over year. And if you look at the segment of the customers above $500,000, there was 25% growth in store count, and above a million dollars, we had a 30% growth. So we are a strong growth player. On what we can control, it was a really good quarter. We beat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,16,2022-11-04 14:46:56
4829," 25% growth in store count and above a million dollars, we had a 30% growth. So we are a strong growth player on what we can control. It was a really good quarter. We beat on also an EBITDA and we beat on the outlook. So for us, it was a very good quarter. What hurt us is what we are planning for in the future where we think there'll be a bit of softness, not in terms of our customers and demands, but in terms of the GMV of our customers. And because we are rewarded as a percentage of their revenues, of course, that's going to impact. But still, we are planning very strong growth for the second half of the year. What is the most difficult thing about operating through this particular environment from the CEO perspective? Yeah, well, I mean, you know, this short term versus long term, you know, at light speed, we are a great business. We're building a, you know, we're building a business that's going to last forever. And then you have the daily fluctuations, you know, investor feelings. But I think for us, the way we look at it, we've outlined the plan. We're ahead of this plan and we're doing really well. Now there are things we can't control, you know, currency exchange rates. We do 40% of our business outside of the US. And then the other thing we can't control is consumer buying. But on what we can control, this has been a really good quarter and, and the business is doing really well. J.P., have you followed your colleagues? Excuse me. It appears in tech and implemented hiring freezes or layoffs. Well, most of the companies that are hiring freezes are doing these are, are not companies that are growing the way we are. These are companies that were pure digital. Light speed, the majority of our businesses have physical presences. And as you know, the markets or the consumers have returned to shopping and dining in person. So we are a strong growth story. So we are actually looking today for, I think we have 360 positions open on our website because the company is going to be growing. Now this being said, we have a path to profitability. Next fiscal year, we want to be evict that positive. And we plan on doing that. But, but we have to hire enough people to sustain the growth that we are, we are currently having. And J.P., I'm curious what you're hearing from your clients on the hiring front as well. As you mentioned, restaurants, small retailers, etc. We just got the jobs report today that show there's still growth in things like hospitality jobs, for example. It has a gotten easier for these businesses to find people to hire. And that is actually the biggest issue in our industry is that it's very difficult to hire people right now. Most of the people who are working in the hospitality and the retail space found out a drawups during COVID and left the industry and they're having a hard time getting them back into the industry. So I think that's really what's hurting our customers right now. And that's why we think it's probably a moment in time and a unique moment in time for light speed because the only way out for our customers because they can't hire enough people is to have platforms that help them automate. And unfortunately for the market, the majority of the systems out there right now are legacy platforms that are really not not really efficient in terms of helping them operate in this environment. Have you seen in the data that you're able to kind of glean insights into for all of the businesses that leverage your platform, leverage your service? That there is any major pullback or shift at least in the way that businesses are being able to conduct different services, whether that be on the food front or whether that be on wherever the platform may be, if the consumers are actually pulling back on their spend or shifting dramatically how they're spending. So for now, we haven't, well, we see the big shift we've seen with consumers because we do have also delivery platforms and we also connect with all of the order head platforms. What we have seen very clearly is from the end of the pandemic to today, there's a very, there's a massive return into physical. So that means our customers are selling more and more in their physical spaces. So I think and that's really the complexity right now is that the consumers are still consuming online. They're still using delivery and order ahead, but they're also consuming in the physical space, which means that for the customers, it's more difficult than ever to manage these. And so you often see it, you know, when you go into restaurants and they have four or five iPads and each of every iPad is for, you know, a different delivery network or and that's where we can help them. We can go in and integrate those platforms and make it much simpler for them to run their businesses. So we have seen this big shift and then on a consumer basis, what we've seen is summer was very strong for hospitality. We've seen a lot of people just return to restaurants and we're.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,17,2022-11-04 14:50:59

We've seen a lot of people just return to restaurants and we're starting to see a slight slowdown in terms of of consuming but we are still you know in very healthy healthy volumes.

Absolutely everyone let's take a brief look at the markets we've had the Dow ripping to the upside right now by about 500 points on the day it's up 537 540-ish points right now 1.7% in the green the S&P 500 you're also seeing that in the green to the tune of about 1.8% and the NASDAQ composite up 1.8% as well this comes on the back of a better than expected jobs reports but mix because we did have unemployment higher than expected there you're taking a look at some of the actuals versus the estimates or what was anticipated coming into that an hourly wages that inline with expectations as well coming up everyone the earnings parade continues we've got reports from Funko virgin galactic and synomark to talk about on the other side of this break it's going to get funky You You Welcome back. It's time to prep the time and today we focus in on three separate earnings reports one minute each. Let's start with this on the day. Shares of Funko tick or symbol FNK. Oh, it's down bad right now. Oh my god. Missing yet. Oh my gosh indeed. Missing on profit estimates and the money. That's a head of the holidays. Shares moving in a manner that would make everyone bobble their head as we're taking a look at the activity on the day it's down by 50% year. Shrogg. Uh, stunning. It's stunning and it's not no it's you know, I don't think the demand met the company's expectations. We should also know that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,18,2022-11-04 14:55:26
4831," 50% here. Shrug? Stunning. It's stunning. It's not, I don't think the demand met the company's expectations. We should also note that JPMorgan now downgrading the stock. I guess what happened when your stock loses 50%. But they are implementing a lot of new, I think, just processes and machines and technology inside the company to set their foundation for whatever they're looking to do in the future. But this is a massive, massive day of value destruction for fun. It seems like it's not as much the sales that are a problem. It's the profitability that's the problem, the EPS and EBITDA really had a big miss here. And the company is now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin in high single digits for the full year. Previous guidance was around 14.6%. If you look at the midpoint, so that's a big downgrade. Virgin Galactic, we're watching those shares as well. They're up 6% after reporting a wider than expected loss for the third quarter. It did top revenue projections. And most importantly, reaffirmed. It remains on track to launch space tourism services in the second quarter of 2023 and is going to have its commercial spacecraft going up in the middle of next year. I mean, earning shmurnings for this thing. It doesn't obviously make any money yet. But it's all about the timeline here going forward. So that sort of confirmation is encouraging. No, you're making a faceprice. They're selling tickets to space. They're selling tickets to go into sub-oantoresession. Right, inter-resession. Right inter-resession. Like my goodness. Do we really expect it from me? Even the ablwinn community is saying in this economy, right? Like the people who would buy tickets to space. Or not impacted? Or not people who are getting. Yeah, they own text stocks that have been down 80% this year. Even still. I don't know. You're not sold. No, well, I'm not there. I'm not there. I'm not where they're going after. I'm sorry. I'm not buying a ticket. I don't know. Maybe, yeah, maybe on the margins. I don't know. Maybe you put it off a career. Speaking of tickets, shares of a cinema can focus after reporting third quarter earnings, eating expectations on the top line, total revenue, up 50% year over year. As we continue to see the recovery of theatrical movie going, it's good quarter-finished cinema. Not bad. Good to see you. I've been back to a couple of movies as well. So I think that there is a comeback story to be had for the movie theaters. It's just a question of how much they're going to be reliant on titles. Of course, cinema, it's really been a turnaround story that they've needed to initiate from exploring bankruptcy all the way to, okay, how do we just make sure that with any titles that make it into our theater, we're able to stave off competition at the same time. Making sure that you are able to have enough employees to operate this. I think for the experiences that I've had in the theater this year, you could do it without a lot of employees. And I hate to say that, but it is become so streamlined from the point of purchasing digitally to showing up, watching the movie, and then dipping. Yeah, well, the company's adjusted EBITDA is improving and beat estimates, so that's helping matters as well. Kind of speaking to your point about maybe cutting some costs here. The company said August and September were challenged by a dip in content availability. That's code for not a lot of good movies out there, I guess, but anyway, so we're watching that. All right, let's take one last quick quick look at the markets before we leave you. They are in the green up once again after cutting their leads now are almost at the highs of the session.

4832," MUSIC Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11 a.m. on the East Coast. Say it out here in the west. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Happy Friday to all of you. Here's what I'm watching this hour. Mixed signals in the labor market. The US has 261,000 jobs in October blowing past expectations. But the unemployment rate ticks higher to 3.7%. Those hot numbers signaling the Fed will continue to raise rates a little longer. Layoffs at Twitter, thousands of Twitter employees bracing for news this morning. They may be out of the job. It's all part of a new owner and CEO Elon Musk's plan to revamp the social media giant. We're going to have all the details for you coming up. And it is a big morning for door to ash. Shares are surging after a big third quarter earnings beat. We're going to break down the numbers for you. But first let's look at a check of the markets. We are 90 minutes into the trading day. And take a look at how stocks are responding to that strong with unexpected jobs report. The down now up more than 500 points. The S&P 500 up 60 in the Nasdaq up 150. All the major averages. Those still on track to close out the week in the red. With the Nasdaq seeing the steepest losses up today. But it is down on the week. And despite what we're seeing today. The tech heavy index on pace for its worst weekly loss in January of this year. We are beginning this morning, though, with that all important jobs number 261,000 jobs added to the US economy. As unemployment rose to 3.7% in October. Now, as we said, that's a bit of a mixed report coming just days ahead of the midterm elections where Democrats are struggling to convince voters. They can get the job done on the economy. Let's bring in Yahoo finances. Rick Newman and Rick, you know, it's interesting because we've been talking so much about these job numbers as in good news. Not necessarily good news for the markets today. The markets are up. But if you think about where President Biden has positioned himself, especially going into the midterms. Is this good news for the Democrats? I can't tell to honestly, but I mean, let's just let's start with the headline number 261,000 new jobs. I mean, the strength in the job market is astonishing. Economists keep saying we expect the labor market to slow down. We expect job growth to slow down. And it keeps not slowing down. No, we are not adding jobs at the pace we were doing right after the the COVID downturn when suddenly every employer had to catch up. But in a normal economy in a decently growing economy, if you had just 200,000 new jobs per month, that would be a terrific pace of growth. And we've had far more than that all year long and the slow down just keeps not coming. And yet I'm looking at all these analyses today and everybody's disappointed. Everybody was hoping that there would be clearer signs of a slowing job market. And why is that because everybody wants the Fed to stop raising interest rates. And in order to do that, the Fed needs to see signs that a recession is coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,20,2022-11-04 15:04:08
4833," And why is that? Because everybody wants the Fed to stop raising interest rates. And in order to do that, the Fed needs to see signs that a recession is coming, that job gains are slowing, that wage gains are slowing. So, you know, it's great that we're adding all these new jobs. And it's unfortunate that everybody is disappointed about that. I mean, with that said, right, you know, what does this mean in terms of messaging and the final days leading up to the midterms? We've heard the president go out and say, look, the economy is still strong, but voters are looking at where inflation is and saying, how do you look at both in contact? Biden cannot win on the, he cannot win this messaging battle. He has had a strong labor market to brag about all year long. And it hasn't worked. And it just tells you how pervasive inflation is. And it tells you how ruinous inflation is for family budgets. I mean, I just did some new analysis this weekend. One of the ironies here is that even though inflation is improving, the rate of inflation has declined from a high of 9% down to, it's now 8.2%. People are actually saying, giving signs that they are getting more worried about inflation, not less worried. And I think for a couple of reasons, number one, the longer it lasts, the longer people think it's going to last. So inflation expectations for the next six to 12 months are very high. People think price, these price hikes are going to stay. And I think another thing that's happening is the longer people have to deal with inflation, the more it streams their, their family budget. So, you know, we got the wage and number today average hour learning is 4.7%. Ordinarily, that would be great. But with inflation at 8.2%, your paycheck buys less. People are literally falling behind and the more, and the longer that goes on, the worse it is for the incumbent Democrats. So it looks like Biden and his fellow Democrats are going to lose at least one Chamber of Congress next week. I think the only question is, are the polls accurate? If the polls are accurate, then it's going to be a bad night for Democrats. So if Democrats are hoping for anything at all at this point, it's at the polls are wrong. And really quickly, Rick, for the Republican side of things, you know, they've certainly seen strength in the economy. At least, you know, that they see that things, at least voters are not necessarily optimistic about where the economy is headed. That's positive for the Republicans. They look at the jobs number today. How do you think they spend this one? They are there. It's the same way they've been spinning it. They just keep pointing to inflation. And that's all they need to do. So I don't think you're going to hear any Democrats saying much, excuse me, Republicans saying much at all about the labor market. They're just going to keep saying Americans cannot afford the basics. And they're not wrong about that. Yeah, just hammering home the word inflation seems to be working for the Republican so far. Rick Newman is always thanks so much for that. For deeper insight, look on what the latest jobs data means for the Fed and the U.S. economy. Let's get right to ADP chief economist Nila Richardson. Nila is Rick said, you know, when you think about the tight labor market, that has really been one of the biggest hurdles for the Fed and its attempt to cool off the economy. What are the numbers today tell you about how much more the Fed needs to do to get it where they want it to be? Hi, great to be with you. Look, the Fed may not be able to go through the labor market to get to lower inflation. I think that's what the numbers tell us today. We're seeing really steady and robust job gains. The BLS report today was pretty broad base. Little different than what the ADP numbers showed earlier this week in terms of the broadness of the hiring. But in terms of the number of jobs created, we showed 239,000 private sector jobs. The BLS was 230 free, so you're seeing the same kind of alignment when it comes to these monthly job gains. For the Fed, that means that it's not the labor market that's seeing weakness. It's things like housing and maybe stocks, but not the stock market today. So they have their work cut out for them. Yeah, it's been interesting to see the reaction and the past we've sort of seen the strong jobs numbers kind of lead to declines in the broader market. What do you put this in context for us right now? Because you said, look, it's not necessarily the labor market that the Fed has to deal with. It's other areas like housing. Are there other levers that you think the central bank can be pulling when you consider that the rate hikes they've implemented so far haven't necessarily led to a significant cooling off of the labor market? You know, the Fed has fundamentally won.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,21,2022-11-04 15:08:19
4834," The rate hikes they've implemented so far haven't necessarily led to a significant cooling off of the labor market. You know, the Fed has fundamentally won move, and that's rate hikes. Unfortunately, they can go faster, they can go slower, but they're still going to hike rates. I think what we are anticipating, at least I am, is that not just that they hike, but that they hike and they stay at an elevated federal funds rate for a period of time to bring back inflation. The bottom line is, when you look at the labor market, when you look at consumer spending, this is a long game for the Fed. It is not a short game, and that means that rates are likely to stay higher for longer than was originally anticipated by the Fed. Wage gain is certainly something we've been keeping a watch on. As we know, so many companies have had to deal with the higher cost that have come with a very tight labor market. Early earnings up 0.4% in October from the previous month, we are seeing a slight cooling down if you can call it that. But what are you hearing from employers who are saying, look, we can't necessarily fill the jobs, but maybe we don't necessarily have to dangle the same incentives we did six months ago. Well, 80 PPS1 and six workers in the United States. We have a lot of payroll data. When we look at pay growth, what we're saying is exactly what you see in this BLS report, it's exactly what Powell pointed to in this press release, that wage growth is slowing, but it's slowing to and stabilizing at an elevated level. It's still much higher than it was this time last year. So wages are not likely pushing up inflation, but it may keep inflation prolonged at the current level. And what we're hearing from our clients, especially our small business clients, is that it's still a tough time finding qualified workers, especially in consumer facing industries like restaurants, leisure and hotel accommodations. And so there's still a struggle here for the smaller firms who were out competed by larger firms earlier on in the recovery. Now is there chance to hire some of these larger firms take a pause? It's been a situation of good news, sometimes being bad news. And this report specifically, I guess the bad news that could be good news is that unemployment did tick a little higher. We're talking about 3.7%, which is still historically pretty low. I mean, how much higher do you think that number needs to go in order to see a real cooling up? Well, I focus on the real economy on the jobs market. So good jobs numbers are good news always. And I think the unemployment number we have to put it in context. It's still below 4%. It's still at historical lows. That number is coming from the household survey, which is a little less reliable. That number, the 3.7% is likely going to take up back and forth over the next couple of months. But the punchline here is that we're still seeing job gains. And if you match that data to the initial jobless claims numbers that are still around pre-pandemic levels, we're not seeing a lot of firms starting to lay off. And that's good news for Main Street. Main Street is the bulk of the economy. So that's good news for economic growth. Yeah, a lot of the layoff news largely focused on places like tech we did here, but higher increases in places like Amazon as well as Lyft. But we'll continue to watch that. And let's get to have you on today. Nila Richardson, ADP Chief Economist. And here to take a closer look at the market action following today stronger than expected jobs data. We've got Yahoo Finance's Jared Blickery standing by. And Jared, this is a big pop that we're seeing on the back of a strong jobs number. Yes, we are. And it's somewhat reminiscent to me of that big pop we got after the last CPI report, which should have been bearish by all accounts because it was coming in pretty hot. But guess what? The market is reacting pretty strongly. S&P 500 up over 1.25%. And the Dow is really outperforming. Let me just put a five-day chart here. And we can see the Dow is still down about 1.25% for the week. But it has come back to the mid-range of that five-day range. Nasdaq still hovering down below. And boy, it has been a story of two different markets here when you consider tech and the value trade that's more heavily represented by the S&P 500 and the Dow. So here's the S&P 500. We're just kind of chopping around down here. 3,900.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,22,2022-11-04 15:12:40
4835," tech and the value trade that's more heavily represented by the S&P 500 in the Dow. So here's the S&P 500. We're just kind of chopping around down here, 3,900, excuse me, 3,900, which is right here is a huge level and also this breakdown region from the Fed the other day, 3,800, also going to be big as kind of where we stop today. But all in all, I think investors will take this, especially after the carnage that they suffered just a few days ago at the hands of Pauline Cole. By the way, today materials in the forefront, that's a story about China potentially re-opening along with consumer discretionary financials, energy staples and industrials, nice mix to see their Akiko. And finally, Jared, we're seeing a pretty broad-based gains today in the market. But want to hone in on the energy space here, oil seeing a big pop today. We got that news from G7 countries that they had agreed to how exactly this Russian oil price cap would be implemented. And what more can you tell us about how exactly this is likely this way in terms of where oil prices are likely to move? Sure. The thinking now is that it's going to be a fixed price limit instead of one that varies with the price of oil. The number that I've seen floating around is $60 per barrel. You can see WTI here, which trades pretty closely to Brent Crude. That's up 4% today. I think that's more on the reports that we're getting a possible re-opening of China based on the fact that they may be rescinding the Zerocovid, or at least revising that policy here today. But there is that European, I guess, ban sanctions that go into effect on December 5th. So this is ahead of that. I don't think it's going to be a huge deal for the oil market. I think it's going to come down to the demand characteristics. And especially with these marginal swings that we've seen with respect to China, maybe a few other places. But you look at the broad complex and commodities, say, a lot of green, a lot of dark green, and guess what? We're also seeing the US dollar come down appreciably, particularly against the Renminbi over in China. Yeah, a lot of countries looking at that and saying there's some relief and slight potentially. Jared Vlickery, thanks so much for that. Let's take a look at shares of Funko, failing to get the poppings looking for after disappointing earnings. That stock is down more than 50%. That's right. The company behind the collectible figurines reported earnings of $0.28 a share in revenue of $365.6 million. That was higher than this three expected, but weak guidance for the all-important holiday season for shares plummeting. The company now expects holiday growth and profit to remain relatively flat from the same period last year. That prompted JP Morgan to downgrade the stock from overweight to neutral, the firm slashing Funko's price target in half the $16 a share. Well, coming up on the other side Starbucks credits customers adding more stuff like Syrups to their coffee for its earnings beat, and that trend continue. We'll talk to an analyst after the short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,23,2022-11-04 15:17:10
4836," Konstantina.... Well, investors giving shares of Starbucks a big jolt in the session today. That stock is up nearly 10%. The coffee chain posted a record quarter attributing its success to rising prices, even despite some economic headwinds. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Brooke DiPala, who's all over the numbers for us and Brooke, you know, the good news is domestically there are consumers who are spending more per visit, but there's some headwinds over these. We'll get to that, but let's sort of start on the domestics of the positive news first. Yeah, Kiko, some positive news here is that although McDonald's, those Starbucks is not have a jingle like McDonald's Starbucks and Wall Street are certainly singing to the tune of this fiscal fourth quarter report. Wall Street, tier today, Starbucks having the best day since May shares of nearly 10% in two hours into trading day here. Now, as you noted here, despite them setting higher prices in Q3, they did give us a bit of an estimate there that they raised about 5% over the past 12 months. But that actually did lead to higher revenue here, record $8.4 billion. Here in the US, seems to sell sales jumped by 11%. Thanks to a 10% increase in average ticket price. But just how long will that momentum continue and can customers expect another price hike? Starbucks, the above Rachel, are you are you are waiting this morning with Yahoo Finance? Really in response to inflationary pressures. We'll have some of that this year based on annualization from moves we made last year, but we expect our pricing to return to actions that are more on a historical level. What we focus on is really how do we sustain that ticket? Because it isn't just pricing, it's actually volume as well. We've seen our customers purchase more that's evidence in attach, increased attach. So we're seeing increased volume. Now some of those offerings of what they consider that are driving volumes include customization here about 60% of beverages are now customized, modifiers have grown in double digits. And that includes stuff like pumpkin spice syrup, or pepper mocha, syrup is going into your coffee. But Rachel continued to emphasize that the partners and as you noted labor inflation, certainly coming into consideration here, driving this demand that Starbucks is willing to fill, also Rachel emphasized that they continue to believe that a side by side relationship with partners is most important in this organization efforts continuum. Side note, Brooke, it looks like you and Rachel were wearing the same top. I didn't know. We have the same color. I was going to leave her drink. We were talking about China because we did see a double digit decline in same source sales there. There's been some rumors floating around this week that potentially China could ease its zero-covid policy. What more did we hear from Starbucks about what that's likely to mean for their second largest market? Yeah, well, like so many US consumer brands, Starbucks is certainly hoping and weighing and ultimately, you know, super bullish on the fact that this COVID-19 zero policy will be lifted soon. It's really taking a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,24,2022-11-04 15:21:22
4837," And ultimately, you know, super bullish on the fact that this COVID-19 zero policy will be lifted soon. Starbucks really taking a leader position here, ultimately weighing in and continuing to grow. Now there's nearly 6,000 stores opening up in China. And Rachel emphasized that they're actually moving towards a digital there in the midst of mobility not being back to where it was pre-sendemic. She said that 44% of the overall sales are digital now. And then once mobility lifts, they expect those stores to operate and continue to grow. Howard Schultz also super optimistic here. He strongly believes that they will come out of this pandemic as the number one Western consumer brand. So certainly something that's keeping eye on and will continue to follow how exactly that performs on Wall Street. Yeah, that's certainly been a key market for Starbucks for a very long time. A book thanks so much for that. Let's give the conversation going on Starbucks. We've got Sarah Senator, Bank of America, Senior Restaurant Analyst. Sarah, let me just start with your takeaways from the numbers that we got. A bit of a mixed results. I mean, positive things are moving in the right direction, but still some headwinds abroad. Yeah, I would say more positive than negative. So from the perspective of the US, you know, certainly one of the, if not the best, same-store sales numbers, we've seen come out of the earnings season this quarter. The fact that they had 10 points of check is certainly a reflection on, you know, as as earlier was said, people adding food, people customizing. But also, you know, they said they did have positive transactions, which is a real rarity in this operating environment right now. So that combination was really, I think, very unique and a testament to how strong the brand is and the affinity that customers have. You know, outside of the US, very, very strong results with the exception of course of China, where we know lockdowns led to really intense mobility constraints. But even there, the same-store sales were better than people had anticipated. So really recovering very nicely when some of these restrictions are lifted. And again, I think a reflection of how strong the brand is and the ability to start with connected with consumers in that market. And is well positioned as when the lockdown restrictions ultimately are lifted. You know, Starbucks are only not unique in raising some of their prices. We have seen so many food restaurants, you know, really try to make up for the additional cost they're having to pay for. But I wonder how much more pricing power you think Starbucks has? Well, I think you make a very good point there, which is that Starbucks is not unique. And in fact, Starbucks has actually taken less price or smaller price increases your rear than most in the industry. So if you look at the consumer price index for food away from home, which is restaurants, you see that that's up, you know, 8%, 9%. I think about 7.5%, 8% year-to-date more recently. If you look at some of the other restaurants in the industry who have reported 5%, 6%, which is what Starbucks says on their menu is actually very low end of the range. So typically we're hearing prices more in the 8% range. McDonald's took 10 to pull away, took about 11 and a half on their menu. So to have 6% price increase your rear really is exceptional, but only in the sense that it's lower than what you're seeing at most other restaurants. And finally, Sarah, I want to get back to the point you made about China. I mean, certainly the expectation seems to be that if there is some softening on a zero-covid policy activity picked up, people go back into stores. You know, these are all positives, especially for retailers like Starbucks, but we're also looking at some significant downturn in terms of the economy, in terms of the broader growth that we're seeing on employment higher in the second largest market there. What's a realistic expectation about how much Starbucks can return to what extent Starbucks can return to pre-pandemic levels in China? Well, I think, you know, a couple things. One is just in terms of thinking about the pace of growth that Starbucks has in China. Big part of it has been new unit growth. So same-store sales will certainly be prior to COVID, or healthy in that kind of 3 to 4% range, but really the big driver of growth and a value creation for Starbucks and for Chinese consumers has been opening up new restaurants. So, you know, the expectations that they can continue to do that at a low-down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,25,2022-11-04 15:25:37
4838," of growth and a value creation for Starbucks and for Chinese consumers has been opening of new restaurants. So, you know, the expectations that they can continue to do that at a low double digit pace, certainly if you look at the store base, you know, it's roughly 6,000, that compares to the U.S. of over 14 or 15,000. So, you know, think about the relative size of the population. It certainly would seem to suggest that they're targeted about 9,000 stores in China's eminently achievable. So, I don't see reason to think that that universe has to slow. To your point, you know, Starbucks is very cognizant of the economic pressures facing the country, but I think, you know, what they have done so well in the last few years is really adapt their loyalty program and make sure that they can really speak directly to customers one to one, which I think is very important at all times, but certainly as consumers are thinking about their budget, as they're thinking about where they want to spend their discretionary dollars. Sarah Seneswar, Bank of America Senior Restaurants Analyst, it's good to talk to you tonight, really appreciate the time. Well, coming up thousands of Twitter employees to be losing their jobs today already a lawsuit in the works on the back of that. And we're going to tell you about it after the break. We're going to have some executive visitors. We know everything in meteor for four times more than 30瑈 hit the message. We already begun it at twitter thousands of employees are expected to employed by the company coming just one week after Elon Musk acquired the social media company. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexis Keenan, who has the details. Alexis, we know there's also lawsuits here over these layoffs. The timeline, we were told 9 a.m. Pacific is when employees are likely to get the notice, but it sounds like some of those have already gone out. Yes, so Akiko, here's what we know. We're expecting that these layoffs could be impacting as many as 50% of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,26,2022-11-04 15:30:14
4839," Some of those have already gone out. Yes, so Akiko, here's what we know. We're expecting that these layoffs could be impacting. As many as 50 percent of Twitter's workforce that noticed went out yesterday telling employees that they would get word as to whether they still had a job by 9 a.m. Pacific time. But Twitter has said that it is necessary to do these layoffs, to place Twitter on a healthy path. That's what the company said, according to the Wall Street Journal. And over the past five years though, we should also note that Twitter's ranks have indeed swelled in 2021. The company added about 2000 jobs. That was a jump of 36 percent over 2020. Now the lawsuit that you mentioned, that was filed from employees yesterday. Employees that still had their jobs. Only one of the plaintiffs, purporting a class action lawsuit in California's Federal District Court, saying that they believe that they are anticipating these layoffs and because of them, they would like to say that Twitter is violating a law called the Warn Act. Now there's a state level law for that as well as a federal law. And what it requires is that employers that have 100 or more workers, they have to give 60 days advance written notice when a layoff is going to impact 50 or more employees at a company or a third of the total workforce. It also applies when there's going to be a single site layoff that impacts 500 or more employees that one applies within 90 days. Now there are some penalties associated if there is a violation found by the court. Those penalties include back pay of those 60 days that the employees would have missed, as well as $500 per day per employee so those numbers can add up. And also medical expenses if employees were to have to incur medical expenses without medical insurance during that period. There are some exceptions, though, to that rule and we would expect that in defending itself, Twitter may invoke some of these defenses and they include unforeseen circumstances, business circumstances for the company. So that lawsuit, it's a little bit early having been filed yesterday, but I would think that the court, if those employees are in fact fired, would then give them the opportunity to go forward. But again, it is a class action that is purported to be on behalf of all employees that would be similarly situated. There's certainly a lot that's happened in the week since Elon Musk acquired the company. One thing we know he's not happy about is companies pausing their ad buys on Twitter and he tweeted this a short time ago saying Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups pressuring advertisers. Even the nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists. Extremely messed up. They're trying to destroy free speech in America. We've already seen a number of major companies, at least one major agency saying we want to just hold off on advertising anything until we get a better sense of what this platform looks like. I mean, how is this exit likely to accelerate? Yeah. So it's hard to say, Akiko, you can see there on the screen. These are the companies that have actually come out and publicly stated that they're going to do a pause. They're going to wait to see what content moderation will be about at Twitter under Musque. We have General Mills, you have Vokes Wagon and Audi as well as Pfizer and General Motors. So that's just a few. As far as these groups, we don't know exactly who Elon Musk is talking about. We are reaching out and we will ask him who exactly he thinks is exerting this level of pressure. Okay. I like the screen and on top of the story, thanks so much for that. Well, Twitter is not the only company doing layoffs, lift, stripe, and open door. All announced this week, they're going to be cutting their staff for other companies that are not doing layoffs, but they're not hiring either among them are Qualcomm and Amazon, which says putting a pause on hiring, quote, new incremental hires. Even apples reportedly freezing hiring because of concerns about the economy flowing. And we continue to see that list, especially of tech companies, pausing or cutting jobs growing longer. We're coming up door to ashes, delivering for investors and consumers are still spending on food delivery. Can that growth continue? We're going to ask one analyst on the other side of the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,27,2022-11-04 15:34:20

We're going to ask one analyst on the other side of the creek. We're going to ask one analyst on the other side of the creek. We're going to ask one analyst on the other side of the creek. We're going to ask one analyst on the other side of the creek. We're going to ask one analyst on the other side of the creek. Here's a door dash. Here's a door dash. This is a very strong quarter for door dash at a time when we've heard about consumers pulling back on spending. But we did hear the company caution that consumers spending could deteriorate faster or greater degree than we anticipate. These are their words. What did you take away from the numbers we got yesterday in terms of how these higher costs are starting to weigh on consumers and how that could potentially affect things on the platform? That's an interesting question. Thanks for having me. I think there's a couple things going on that are sort of encouraging to investors this morning. One is what you just point out is the resiliency of their demand, their gross order value growth. It was up substantially, including with an acquisition they did in Europe, which I was concerned about, called woe, which was up 60% year over year from a much smaller base, but still very good growth. And the second thing is I think what they're doing and which was smart is providing a little bit more insight into how profitability is growing. So there's a lot of investment going on, which they've always advertised since the IPO, but now they're providing insight into the core growth in their restaurant business where their profits are up like 50% year over year. So there's a lot of good incremental money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,28,2022-11-04 15:38:29
4841," insight into the core growth in their restaurant business, where their profits are up like 50% year over year, and where they're seeing very good incremental margins. So I think that was encouraging as well to investors. Yeah, the good news for DoorDash is that users are still on the platform and ordering. It did sound though that like they're starting to see some trade downs. It's not necessarily the high end restaurants have used order from there. You're still on the platform, but you're ordering from other areas that may come with a cheaper price point. When at what point do you think because of the higher cost overall, some users start to say, well, maybe I don't need that delivery as frequently as I used to use it. Well, it's also important to remember that when you look at their numbers, there's inflation embedded into their top line, right? Because you're buying a pizza that costs 10 or 15% more than it did a year ago. And then when you look at what's going on with the consumer specifically, what they think they're seeing is smaller basket sizes. So maybe instead of ordering that extra egg roll or the extra pizza, you're being more proficient with how much leftovers you want. So that's happening as well. I think in general, if you look at consumer trends, they are generally holding up because one, this is a very under penetrated market. There's no area where they're more than 10% of their available market, whether you're geographically or by restaurants, et cetera. And then secondly, food is going to be less cyclical. And then thirdly, as they add subscribers, those subscribers generally are more frequent users of the app, especially as they add new categories like groceries and convenience stores, which are really gaining scale now. Door to Door to Door is certainly unique in that they've largely been focused on deliveries. When you look at their competitor, for example, like Uber, they've obviously got the right hailing side, the food side, to your point, we've seen Door Dash diversify their offerings. But when you look at those two names side by side, who do you think is better position to write out some of these economic headwinds? That's a really interesting question. I think at this point, given how strong the travel backdrop is, especially in the U.S., that Uber would be the preferred play overall. It's not to say that Door Dash in and of itself doesn't have a viable business model that's going to be successful over the long term. But if you're trying to balance risk and reward, Uber is actually priced at a more attractive valuation, we think, and offers you that hedge with the travel component, which is very strong right now. Finally, when you look at where you are with the stock, you've got a equal weight rating on the stock. What would it take for you, or what would you need to see to change that? So what we tried to express in our report this morning is that there's been some incremental changes in terms of how we understand the business and how they're expressing what's going on with the business to investors. Most importantly, on the incremental profits that are dropping down, you can get a better feel for some of these investments turning to scale. That does lead you to believe that EBITDA growth can be stronger next year. I think we need to see a little bit more performance relative to the current macro into the end of the year. I think what they printed yesterday and what they got it to is definitely going to put a firm floor on the stock. It's probably going to be volatile for a while, and then we'll evaluate it going forward. But we were definitely intrigued by what we saw off of that print. It certainly looks like you're not the only one if you look at the stock creation today. Stephen Fox, Fox Advisors, Fever CEO, get to have you on. Thank you. Well, take a look at shares of Coinbase. That is pushing higher here up more than 6%. The company's third quarter earnings missed analyst estimates, but they were able to retain users and lower expenses better than analysts expected. Today's chart of the day is from Coinbase's shareholder letter. It is 2022 crypto market cap through the end of the third quarter. According to Coinbase, the average daily crypto market cap declined 30% when you compare it to the previous quarter. Part of the problem was the big declines and big point and Ethereum, which are also down a year to date, declines like those contributing to lower volatility in the crypto space. Lower volatility means less trading, which affects Coinbase's bottom line and Ethereum. They're down more than two.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,29,2022-11-04 15:43:00

Well, coming up the US added 261,000 jobs in October, we're going to do a deeper dive into two of the sectors where we saw significant growth that's coming up after this break. Employment and leisure and hospitality continue to trend up in October, with 35,000 jobs added for the month, although the sector as a whole is still 6.5% below its February 2020 level. Joining me now to discuss trends in the sectors, Nicholas, Lillio, Cesar CEO of NALSTDA, comprehensive workforce management platform. Nicholas, good to talk to you today. Let's start by talking about how exactly you are sort of at this intersection here. You've got pretty good visibility on the hiring in this specific space, but how's your software support all that? Yeah, great. Thanks for having me here. I'm excited to tell you about what we do. So at a high level, we're an operating system for hourly gig and flex workforces. As we all know, there's been immense challenges that these workforces are currently facing. What our platform does is help employers find workers, and it also helps them manage them. We're really oriented around helping employers transform into flex and dynamic workforces, moving away from the traditional 40-hour work week and allowing them to better access different pools of labor. We have a platform called FlexPool that aggregates a bunch of labor sources in a particular area, and essentially gives employers access to logistics and other opportunities to engage with this workforce so they can ensure that they're fully staffed. So it's kind of what we do. So what's the data that you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,30,2022-11-04 15:47:29
4843," opportunities to engage with this workforce so they can ensure that they're fully staffed. So, it's kind of what we do. So, what is the data that you have there through your platform? What does that tell you about how many workers are looking for a little more flexibility, but more importantly, how competitive the pay is for those who are looking for those types of jobs? Yeah, absolutely. So, workers are looking for flexibility. I think employers have been slow to embrace the idea that flexible work is here to stay. And they're struggling to find workers who are willing to work 40-50 hours a week. Workers want to be able to choose when they work. They might want to work 15 hours this week, 20 hours the following week. And they have to adapt to the fact that workers have preferences that don't necessarily align with what employers want. So, what we've been really oriented around is helping them better access pools of labor that allow them to work with these types of workers. We give them tools to help them schedule. We allow them to better and more easily track these workers. So, there's a fundamental change in the labor market and employers are just struggling to find people. It's very challenging out there. And we're showing on the screen there some of the top cities that are most attractive for flex workers right now, New York, Atlanta, LA, Denver, and Dallas. You know, we have seen employers increasingly turn to a little more flexible work schedule, largely because of need. What are you hearing from them about their ability to fill these job posts once they add a little more leeway into the scheduling? Yeah, so they're seeing huge increases in their ability to fill jobs when they adopt flex. They're realizing that workers are more productive, they're happier, they're more able to work when they can choose the terms on which they work. And so employers that have embraced it have seen tremendous results with that. Now, it doesn't mean that employers aren't facing challenges with the increased complexity with flex work. But on the whole, the employers who adopt flex work are seeing much higher fill rates than employers who have not. And where are some of the biggest employers utilizing your software? So, we work with dozens of pro sports teams, most of the major hotel and hospitality brands like Marriott, Milwaukee Brewer's, those types of entities. We also work with Fortune 50 and Fortune 500 big box retailers, warehouses, distribution centers, those types of entities. Now, Cecio, Nicholas, Lillios, joining us in our New York video. Good to have you on today. Thank you. Well, employment and healthcare rose by 53,000 in the month of October. That is 13 consecutive months of additions for the sector. The industry has been hiring at a rapid pace this year, about 47,000 jobs a month this year versus the 9,000 back in 2021. Angeloi Kamlani here to look at a kind of an interesting angle in this space. Angeloi, I know you've been looking at where these job postings are and you found an interesting trend. I did. Actually, it started off with sort of an anecdotal hearing about a rise in chief medical officers at corporate America, and especially during the pandemic. And so I started looking into that. And what I found was really interesting. Not only did we see sort of a shift in what was happening. So you mentioned that those gains in the past year, but let's turn the clock back a little bit. What we saw was actually a drop in the number of healthcare jobs and those with medical training for the entire year of 2021, or reporting to at least 300,000 lost jobs in that year alone. Meanwhile, of course, we've seen the gains since then and in the past year, but chief medical officers that saw a spike during the pandemic. So start off with 2019, just 767 job postings. Meanwhile, going to 2020 30, 400, 2021 more than 5,000 and now in 2022 to date nearly 3000 alone. So that just tells you the story of sort of where this mass exodus is of these medically trained individuals and especially doctors getting opportunities in health tech and startups in corporate America at senior level positions to really help guide companies who are now starting to re-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,31,2022-11-04 15:51:38
4844," Getting opportunities in health tech and startups in corporate America at senior level positions to really help guide companies who are now starting to realize the importance of having a trained physician or a trained clinician on board to not just keep their employees healthy, but also in the event of another pandemic, which we know experts are wary about and been warning about, to have someone in-house who they can consult in a time of need. Yeah, you know, that was kind of my question, Angelina, and it makes sense in something like health tech to have a chief medical officer when you're talking sort of traditional corporate America. I mean, what does that job entail, number one, but what is the incentive for these companies who are not necessarily in health care to be hiring for this? Well, like I said, the pandemic is one thing, but really beyond that, we know that health care is one of the most costliest expenses for companies, right? Sales for CMO, Githin, Iar told me that it's the most expensive cost on the balance sheet for companies. So, having that to look at, it means that companies really need to look at a way to not only drop costs, but also address some of the issues. Having a clinician can advise on preventative measures, on preventative services, on mental health as well. So, all of that is coming together now with all of these companies that you can see on your screen. These are the ones that have either had chief medical officers or brought one on board during the pandemic in order to respond to the pandemic. And all of these officers told me there's definitely room for growth in this area. Yeah, it certainly makes sense when you consider just, um, health-up, but a lot of these companies were caught, less food during the pandemic. I actually think so much for that. Well, coming up those looking for a job in New York City, I'm now going to know something job seekers in other cities don't. How much that job pays. We're going to tell you more about it after the break. Well, this week in New York City, all job listings must now include salary range. That's according to the New York City Commission on Human Rights. The salary listings must have a maximum and a minimum and will be based on good faith of the employer. For more on this, let's bring in Yahoo Finance, the Danny Romero on how New York City employers are starting to comply. You know, there's a lot of employees that I know are curious about what the range is for similar jobs, but how quickly has compliance come up to date and what are the some of the challenges that employers are facing?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,32,2022-11-04 15:56:06
4845," that I know are curious about what the range is for similar jobs, but how quickly has compliance come up to date and what are the some of the challenges that employers are facing? Look, Akiko, I mean, I feel like what we're seeing is that employers are really testing the limits with this new transparency law here in New York City that requires posting those salary ranges. I mean, some employers even posted very broad salary ranges that the difference is over $100,000 for this one position. So it's leaving applicants confused when they are looking into these job postings, but the law requires that all companies with four or more employees to produce a good faith salary range, something that the employers are willing to pay for that candidate, and it's expected to benefit four million private sector workers and employers will get a 30-day warning to correct any violations before facing fines. So we did seek some companies jump on this bandwagon and comply before the rollout of this law, Bank of America was one of them, JP Morgan City Group Comcast, that's just to name a few, Akiko. And other states like Colorado have started to roll out this pay transparency law as well. What does that mean for the broader labor market? I mean, does that give employees a little more leverage, let's say, because of the transparency? I mean, I feel like we could see this pay transparency law really roll out across the nation. I mean, California is the next one up and they're expected to roll out their pay transparency law next year in January. So if we consider the states that have rolled out so far, which include Colorado, New York, and soon to be California, I mean, it could impact one in six workers that is according to pay scale. So considering these laws, I mean, these laws really aim to close the gap and racial pay gap. And those gaps are larger for women. I mean, women make 83 cents for for every dollar, men earn. And for women of color, the gap is even wider. So there has been some backlash, Akiko from some of these Wall Street banks that say that it forces them to disclose too much to their rivals. But on the flip side, Akiko, this really touches upon the fact that maybe we're talking maybe talking about your salary or even being transparent about it is no longer taboo. I mean, we can see on TikTok, some of these Gen Zers make reels asking people what's your job? How much do you make? So we're really seeing a change in demographics right now. Okay, a bit of a shift in the labor market there. Danny Romero, thanks so much for that. That doesn't for me in this 11 o'clock hour. We obviously were going to be covering and continue to cover the market reaction to that jobs report today. Keep it right here in Yahoo!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,33,2022-11-04 16:00:23
4846," Here is the Caution of a After the snack brand reported, it's 11th straight quarter of over 9% revenue growth and said higher prices count to 420% of the rise. Hostess Brandt, CEO, Annie Callan joins us now to discuss and you always nice to see here. We're sure getting some pretty good reads on consumers back out there traveling and moving around. What are you seeing in your brand within convenience stores? Yeah, well, you know, the breath of our portfolio is pretty wide across all channels. We do see a lot of resiliency. You know, we have an on the go or high impulse category. Consumers are back traveling. We're in two spaces, both with macro trends and tailwinds behind us for our split vacates. And one of them is indulgent and permissible snacking of which our portfolio and Twinkie fits the bill. Convenience is very resilient. Consumers are still traveling and they're going through whether it's around the home more. When they're in the round the home more, they're traveling around the home more. That's good for our business and when they're driving more, that's good for our business. So we're really seeing a lot of resiliency, including in our convenience channel, which point of sale grew above 13% this last quarter. And I'm also curious, Andy H. Julie here, which categories, which subcategories are doing the best right now? What's sort of the hottest product out there? Well, our core icons always do well. We're pre-packed. Most of our portfolio is prepared for snacking and our two iconic brands or iconic brand hostess with all of its subbrands as well as our boardman portfolio, which is a little bit more than 10% of portfolio are both performing well. By the way, boardman point of sale was up 28.8%. So we see indulgent snacking on total, a really continuing half trailwinds. That's been before the pandemic and that's now today. And we really have a pure play snacking portfolio. So we're well positioned to capitalize on that growth with the assets to achieve that growth. We see morning breakfast continuing to grow. That's a $5.8 billion segment. We recently launched Bound Show that really attacks the lunch box occasion at $6.2 billion in total consumer occasions. So this indulgent snacking is really moving across the board in the faces of we compete. Our boardman portfolio, by the way, is the number one share within sugar free for cookies and $8 billion total category, but it's growing and more than twice a rate of total cookies. So we were really positioned well for macro consumer trends. Andy, you've put up several good quarters in a row now. What is it about a twinkie or the other products that you're selling? There are other snacks out there. Had you survey folks on why they're gravitating to your brands? Well, there's a couple of things. First of all, even during times of recession or when times are good, consumers reach for permissible and indulgent snacks that they feel are at an accessible price point. We're maniacal and making sure we provide the right value to our consumers when they have. The other thing that we really spend a lot of time over the last three or four years is focusing on our product quality. So when consumers come and they want an indulgent snack, they want it to be a good reward. They don't need a lot, but they need it in a portion controlled form. We've invested in product quality, our penetration and households is going up. But also, we're accessing and adding two times buyer to our category, to our franchise, to our host's business, as greater than twice the rate of the rest of the category. That means when consumers come and try us, they'd like it and they're coming and repeating. So we're doing all of the fundamentals at right. I don't top of that are increasing advertising to build the gap between our aided awareness and top of mind awareness and our innovation. And you get a recipe for 11 straight quarters above 9 percent growth. Andy, you talked about holding the line on value at the same time you did take price, right? So, you també進 already. Now when you did a speech for your public comment on the title, that city offer,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,34,2022-11-04 16:04:52
4847," and our innovation and you get a recipe for 11 straight quarters above 9% growth. Andy, you talked about holding the line on value at the same time you did take price, right? Because that's one of the things, or the main thing that was responsible for the revenue bump here. So how do you calculate that A and B, what happens to price now going forward? Are you going to keep on raising? As we sit here today, what we see, especially as we close out the years to, we're only talking about 23, we have the pricing in the marketplace to obviously deliver our raised guidance. We raised our revenue and top and bottom line guidance for the full year of FY22. This is the way we look at it. We take the value that we deliver to consumers very serious. And then we also have a suite of tools that we love. We utilize to leverage the efficiency of which we deliver them. We balance both of those. So in the quarter despite having a 20% pricing that move through the consumer, our gross margin still contracted a little less than 100 basis points. We believe over time given our revenue growth management initiatives, our productivity initiatives. And when needed, when we get this high of inflation, it was above 18% in the quarter, as a last resort, we do move the pricing. So that's why pricing's in the marketplace now. We think we have the right balance going forward, but given our agility and our continued focus on the fundamentals, if needed, we're in a position to do that. We don't believe we are today. We do, we are committed to, by the way, of recovering our gross margins over time. And as a reminder, our growth algorithm is to a mid single digit top line growth at five to seven percent EBITDA growth and seven and nine percent EPS growth. We believe we'll continue, even from this point forward, despite our incredible performance of the last three years, lead to top tier shareholder return. Andy, real quick, before I let you go, what is your one big product that you're going to launch next year? Anything you could take us inside the C-suite? Well, we're in the process right now of launching our bouncer. So bouncer's is our focus. It targets a lunchbox occasion. It reimagines some of our icons like Twinkies and DingDons and Donets. It puts it in a poppable form, a two-by-poppable form. And it's perfect for the lunchbox or any carried occasion. Retailer acceptance has been extremely positive. We're very proud of it. We're ramping up the consumer advertising here as we move it to Q4. We're very enthusiastic. Obviously consumers will tell, but we're obviously very positive about that. We have a great track record of innovation that we've built over the last several years. Bouncer's. All right. Hostess Francio and E. Calahan. Thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Well, homework helper.

4848," Well homework, helper, Cheg, they aced their third quarter and boosted its full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA as college enrollment begins to stabilize here a little bit more. Cheg's chief financial officer, Andy Brown joins us now. Andy, thanks so much for taking the time and helping us run through the quarter. If you got to think of one catalyst that really sticks out to you within the business from this past period, what is that? Yeah, it's been an interesting 12 months for Cheg and as you had mentioned, things what we're seeing in the headwinds that we saw maybe a year ago have now stabilized. As far as catalyst with respect to Cheg, I mean one of the things that we have been doing is pushing what I'll call offering our premium price option. We call the Cheg Study Pack and we continue to see a great momentum there adding more value to the study pack and more of our students are taking that premium price option and that's had a very nice impact on not just our revenue growth but our earnings and as you saw in our report, we blew through our earnings and we raised our guidance quite significantly. When we think of the past two years, it's really changed the way that a lot of colleges, universities might think about where people can be educated from, how they can be educated, what type of opportunities that create for Cheg even in a Renaissance moment for education or a new normal that we're heading towards? Well, when we came to Cheg, our CEO came 13, 14 years ago, I'm now in my 13th year here, we were a textbook renter but our vision was always that we would offer many types of services online and we used to use the term and continue to use the term that you bet on the inevitable and the inevitable is that more and more things are going to be done online. And so we embarked upon offering subscription services, homework help services that were exactly how students wanted and that is their relatively inexpensive, their online, they're available 24 by 7 and those are the types of services that students expect and we continue to deliver whereas the traditional college experience was all of the help was on campus but that's not the modern student today. I mean, I think a lot of people don't realize is that you may think of a traditional four-year residential school but many students in today's environment are actually part-time students that are commuting into community colleges, they don't have the ability to get help at the institution and so we provide that opportunity to learn anywhere, anytime, any place. And Andy, you guys are also expanding more into things that have nothing to do with traditional students that is college students, right? You're looking more to the corporate world as well. I know you have a partnership that allows companies to give their employees language learning. How big a part of your business is that and how much are you looking to that business for growth? Yeah, so you're talking about our skills platform and we believe for a long period of time that, you know, while most of what we do today or have historically has been academic and we believe skills-based learning will play a much larger role, is playing a much larger role and will continue to play a larger role in the future. So to your point, we have several skills products. One is what we call our thinkful line of services and then more recently language learning with BUSU and we do work with a company called Guild, that then delivers those services to large corporations like Chipotle and Wal-Mart and so forth. And more recently, what we announced on our earnings call that we were going to be including our language skills services through Guild starting in 2023. So we do believe, you know, when you imagine, check, I'll call it two to three years or now, skills will be a much bigger part of our revenue and contribution. And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw feedback from the local wodshef and you could support hiring the user.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,36,2022-11-04 16:13:28
4849," And what about profit? I know you guys, according to analysts and according to what we heard from you all, you're shifting more to focus on profitability. You saw an adjusted EBITDA in the positive. Where is that coming from? How are you guys achieving that? And what are some of your targets on that front? Yeah, so we've always focused on profitable growth. That's always something that we've talked about at our company and as you can see, we continue to do that. We had a nice beat in Q4. But inherently in our model because we've got a fairly fixed content cost and much of our uses come through unpaid sources. It's just natural that as we scale, our margins will scale. And I'll just remind everybody, I mean, we're profitable across every line. It's not just EBITDA, it's not just non-GAP. We're GAP profitable. So we do believe that we'll continue. We're not going to put a cap on where that would be. We're not at a steady state profitability yet. We do believe that as we scale, we will continue to increase our margins. And while we have you, this has been a significant year, perhaps the most significant that I can remember in terms of student loan debt relief and kind of the conversation to advance the cost of college and reforming the high expenses that families and individuals incur. Just from the Cheg Lens, you can give us your read through moving forward from here, where some of these costs can start coming down, given that Cheg was one of those platforms that ultimately can reduce the costs on the book front that were so extensive for a lot of college goers and education seekers. Yeah, so it is painful. And I think this is more of a, it pains me to see college students going to college taking on large debt, but then are unavailable to actually pay it off. And that's what you're seeing. So does that disconnect on the ROI? In many cases, not all cases, but in many cases, the ROI. And I think that is a big part of what as a society we need to fix. What is the ROI of going to college so we don't get into these situations where students fundamentally can't pay that debt off, which is real simple. There isn't an R, there wasn't an ROI on that particular student's education. So I think that's the fix that we need to do. And that still hasn't been accomplished. Andy Brown, thanks so much for being here. Thanks, Cheg's Chief Financial Officer. Checking in on the King.

4851," add dollar menus or kind of entry level ala cart menus. I don't know if dollar is any longer the relevant price point but having an everyday entry level price point product that consumers can go to ala cart and or to bundle I think is an important aspect of being a broad based and very thoughtful restaurant business and that's something that we continue to explore. Look at our teams are working on quality and product offerings at the right price that allow for customers to come in more frequently and enjoy our brands day in and day out. There's two and a half percent net restaurant growth when you think about the franchisees what are you hearing from franchisees right now and even potential franchisees in different markets and how they're potentially looking to get into business with restaurant brands. Yeah we have a lot of excitement around growth in our business and fundamentally restaurant brands and our four amazing iconic brands are growth brands and growth businesses. We've got a lot of room for growth internationally for all four of our brands even Burger King that has north of 12,000 restaurants in international markets. We've got a lot of room for growth we think domestically with firehouse with Popeyes Tim's in the US is beginning to to rev up their engines from a from a growth standpoint and obviously firehouse has a huge runway domestically as well. franchisees are excited they're obviously concerned in near term with the impacts that we're seeing in inflation commodity costs that that's all that translates not only to food costs but also to construction costs. There's there's always a challenge around getting permitting and the process of getting approvals to move forward with new restaurants sites but we have a healthy pipeline we have a lot of interest from existing franchisees as well as new franchisees to develop our brands domestically and internationally and we continue to work with our partners to to move those pipelines along and and continue to grow our businesses and over time we think we're going to we're on our way to our 40,000 restaurant goal with restaurant brands over the next several years. I have 10 seconds left and this is national sandwich day. Somebody's been up in town they've been out there touting their sales gains any any smack talk form. Look our brands are awesome we have firehouse burger king Tim's and Popeyes I think they're the best in each of their categories in burger chicken coffee and and sandwich and I'll let the customers decide who the best brands are. My focus is building a great team working with our franchisees and delivering profitable opportunities for growth across the across our four brands. You're too nice Jose you're too nice. Just too nice. I was there as a customer of Popeyes I can say on this sandwich day that that chicken sandwich is family. Thank you so much for joining us here on the show. Restaurant brands international. Yeah I was just going to say make sure you try the the black and chicken sandwich which is coming out on national TV and on the 7th of November awesome sandwich really cool experience. It's a flavor of New Orleans all around the country. All right so I was putting in his notes so we're going to have to do it we're going to do it. Restaurant brands international CEO Jose so Jose thanks so much as always. Thanks a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,39,2022-11-04 16:26:25
4852," you I'm going to start with the first question. I'm going to start with the second question. I'm going to start with the second question. BlueBin are shares or seeing a pop after topping estimate in his latest quarter that stock up nearly 5%. The global automotive technology company reporting revenue of nearly 30% higher from the previous quarter and up 60% year on year. BlueBin are maintaining its full year guidance as it remains on practical chief. 2022 milestones for more on all this we have Lumen R CEO Austin Russell joining us today Austin it's good to talk to you. I'm going to get through the numbers in a bit but I want to point to an announcement that someone argue kind of overshadowed this wrong core that you had. Lumen R's lighter equipment and software now shipping on cars and then you have to do positive movements at a time where there's concerns about where self driving is going. Talk to me about how that's progressing and what that tells you about the timeline for wider adoption. Yeah, no, I think the whole point of what we've done is that really after 10 years of you know innovating, point of type being developing industrialized. I think we're finally making this journey. We're actually making its way out of that whole moonshot R&D phase into production vehicles and it's something that we couldn't be more excited about. But yeah, it's happening. It's coming together. And of course, psych, you know, is the largest Chinese automaker with their they have a new fully electric brand. You know, rising auto with the R7 that we're launching on but that's just the start. Or I showed the one to that on November 9th. And then we also just had pole star. They just introduced the pole star three a couple of weeks ago. Also featuring a woman or so all this is converging and this is just the start, you know, then you don't were say to use a Nissan and other partners that we have. Fantastic. Let's talk about the numbers in the quarter, especially with the cash on hand. You ended the quarter of the year. And then we have a $150 to $200 million a year. It certainly looks like you are on track to reach profitability. Talk to me about the timeline you're looking at right now for the company. So while we're going to be hosting actually a luminar day, you know, come the first quarter of next year. We're going to outline all the details with the guards to our timeline and plans associated with becoming cash flow positive. But I think the key point is that we're going to have a little bit of a little positivity with a strong buffer as well for everything that we want to do for our four business and beyond. So that's that's really good. But and fortunately in a very privileged position when it comes to capital needs and there's huge upfront capital requirements as well that's needed to make this happen in addition to, of course, the technology to people, the resources and partnerships. And so we're generating real business and revenue. This is the first time that this kind of tech is making its way into a series production for these kinds of, you know, next generation safety and autonomous capabilities and having that revenue ultimately is able to be very helpful towards building a viable business. Whereas, you know, the vast majority of autonomous legal related companies are either have a pre revenue or little to no revenue for the foreseeable future. So that's a fundamental thing to be able to make happen in the growth curve with the automakers. And finally, Austin, you pointed to some of the positive steps you're taking in the partnership that you have with car makers, but, you know, we have had some setback in the autonomous trading.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,40,2022-11-04 16:30:46
4853," to some of the positive steps you're taking in the partnership that you have with car makers, but you know we have had some setback in the autonomous driving push. We had Ford and Volkswagen most recently pulling the plug essentially on their self-driving ambitions and I wonder where you think things are headed. I mean was this kind of shakedown inevitable given the technology that needed to get to full autonomous driving and it's sort of the grand vision that was set out years ago in terms of where this is headed. Is that still intact? Um well one the grand vision that I think many gave in the industry is absolutely not intact. But the key distinction here is that that's a completely different world than the kind of stuff that we're doing here at Luminor. The main issue with what we've seen from a broader autonomous vehicle standpoint is that both the vast majority of companies have really been focused around eliminating the driver with all-out robotaxies in urban environments. So the big bet that we made was actually not that at all. It was actually for consumer production vehicles in trucks as well. As an opportunity to be able to improve the safety of the vehicle enhance the driver, not replace the driver altogether. And that's a key distinction here of how this is happening and the rest of it is actually I mean for what it's worth it's not any different than what I was saying a handful of years ago. I think people may just listen more now. But the reality is that that's a 10-year journey. That's a long time frame here too. What we're doing is already starting to make its way into production cars today. It takes years worth of work and advance and a lead-up of what we've had to do to make it happen. But because of the fact that we're focused on safety, we're focused on much more constrained problems here. Getting rid of that you know $100,000 roof rack full of sensors and a supercomputer in the trunk and now having something that can go on to production vehicles as a cleanly integrated system. That's what we think is incredibly powerful and that's why we're seeing all this adoption by all these major automakers. And I think as the industry evolves we're only missing more and more people pivot towards that strategy which ultimately ends up you know just as with that argo case ends up being more synergistic with the stuff that we're doing. Yeah it's certainly been great to track all the progress with Lumenar. Austin Russell, Lumenar CEO appreciate your time today. Thanks so much for joining us. All right we're joining us now for another perspective on the housing market is Bruce McNeilidge. Kimlock Partners co-founder and CEO Bruce thank you for joining us this afternoon. As we're seeing though even though the Fed good to have you even though the Fed raising rates we're seeing the 10-year yield ticking up mortgage that mortgage rates over the 30-year fixed ticking below 7%. Help us understand the correlations here. Sure so the 10-year treasury doesn't necessarily affect the payments of commercial debt and what builders are paying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,41,2022-11-04 16:35:02
4854," Sure, so the 10 year treasury doesn't necessarily affect the payments of commercial debt and what builders are paying, but certainly it's going to affect interest rates for the average person. And right now, actually, the rates as of yesterday were right around 7 and a quarter, and that really hurts the entry level home buyer significantly because they barely can afford a house right now with the cost of housing going up because of supply chain and materials. And as that house goes up in place, it's knocking more and more buyers out of having the ability to purchase a home and they either have to rent a home or stay in the home that they're currently in. Bruce, just what's your assessment on the damage that the Fed has caused in the housing market? And I guess any concern that the Fed is doing too much with what it sounds like more rate hikes on the table? Sure, so it's really going to be a trickle down position where people are not going to be able to buy houses. It's going to hurt mortgage brokers. It's going to hurt bankers. It's going to hurt realtors really hurt people. And I think what what the situation was people were not ready for this. It turned on a dime and really changed significantly more quicker than most people would have expected. So builders are still building houses, but they can't they can't sell houses and that's really putting builders in a position where they have to discount houses. And with the Fed raising things as again as quick as they they have done it's hurting folks in the residential real estate business significantly. And it's going to take them many months if not a year or two to catch up because of what they've done at the Federal Reserve. So then Bruce, this supply and demand balance that the Fed is looking for. How far out do you see that being? So what it's going to do is it's going to not develop as fact because if if banks aren't loaning money to developers or developers are skittish on developing land, that's going to put builders back several years because you have to develop a land before you build the houses. And so during this time builders can't get commercial loans or interest rates are going up for those loans. Same thing with developers, there are problems getting loans. And that's basically going to end up again a year or two, three years in the future. It's going to have a ripple effect because it's going to cost folks money and it's also going to cost folks a lot a lot of time because they have to catch up because of the slowdown in the economy that the Fed is creating. Bruce, we spoke to you about a month ago. You told us that traffic had been falling off just in terms of demand out there. We saw a little bit of relief. I guess it mortgage rates this morning, although not too far below that 7% number there has demand declined even further over the last couple of weeks from your perspective. I'm actually in one of my new houses we just bought from a builder right now and demand has not wane. The demand is still there. The entry level home buyer, the millennial they want to own house. The problem is the houses are without a reach. They might have been saving and looking at paying a three or four percent interest rate and budgeting for that. But now that the rates are up to 7%, it really forces those people that were working hard and saving for a house. It really knocks them out of the market and it's making tougher for all people to afford a house. And unfortunately that has a ripple effect. So then in terms of inventory, obviously people holding on to the good mortgage rates they got before the Fed started raising interest rates. What is this doing for first time home buyers? What sort of options do they actually have right now? Well, if you can qualify for a mortgage, builders are discounted houses significantly. I've seen 10% 15% even 20% discounts to retail pricing for the entry level home buyer to come in, take a look at houses and able to close on houses. The problem is they just can't afford houses and there are too many houses on the ground. So what builders really need right now is more buyers that can qualify for mortgages. The buyers are out there, the demands out there, but just qualifying for mortgage and then affording that higher payment is really a hurdle for the entry level home buyer. Bruce, you mentioned 10, 15, 20% discounts on the table right now. Can we see larger discounts if demand if traffic doesn't pick up here? Well, I think it could be a discount in the form of number of things. They can give you different features in the house, free refrigerator, ceiling fans, credit for furniture, closing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,42,2022-11-04 16:39:20
4855," Well, I think it could be a discount in the form of number of things. They can give you different features in the house, free refrigerator, ceiling fans, credit for furniture, closing costs, credits to get a mortgage and pay the points. And so I think, again, it's a supply and demand thing. We were in the deep south. We were traveling through Atlanta. And one builder has 150 houses on the ground finished that they have no offers on. 150 houses and that's one builder. Imagine a dozen builders. So really the builders are going to have to keep reducing their prices until the supply and demand takes care of their inventory. And then they can certainly level off those prices. But that's going to be a big hit to the bottom line of builders. But again, something's got to give. There's too many houses built and not enough buyers right now that can qualify for mortgages. Yeah, Bruce, I know that you're focused on the southeast region right now. Is this more of a regional story or is this scenario playing out across the country? No, this is a national story. There are just not enough homes for people that want homes. The millennials are now in their 30s. They're looking to start homes and their subdivisions. They're moving out of the urban core and having children. So the demand is there. The problem is, give an example, people save in 401k right now. 401k have become 301k's. So people certainly don't have the money, whether it's in savings, whether it's the stock market going down and retirement plans that they can borrow from. The money's just not there. The demand is there. And that's across the country. Now the southeast and the southwest are certainly areas that have had much higher growth and much higher demand over the years. But it's a it's a problem nationwide. And Bruce, I want to ask you about some of the layoffs that we've seen with Open Door, with Zillow as well. What are your expectations that we know that obviously that we're far from where we were at the peak of the pandemic when the everyone was sort of clawing for houses right now? What are your expectations for layoffs in the retail industry here? So those I buyers will certainly be cutting back. If they don't have enough houses to buy and sell, that certainly is going to lead to layoffs and reduced income for the I buyers. But this can be a trickle down effect. You're talking about real estate agents. All sorts of different companies are going to be laying off people banks, people that do mortgages, process mortgages, cell houses, realtors. They all are going to be squeezed by this. And I think you're going to see a shake out across all the different industries that make up the financial positions that have to all line up for someone to afford house banks are going to be lending less money. And there's going to be a lot of shake out in the banking industry. Certainly a challenging time. All right. Bruce McNeilidge, Kinlock Partners co-founder and CEO. Thanks so much. 30,000 pilots from the nation's largest airlines rejecting contracts this week. Negotiations derailed by the pandemic now growing tens as the industry contends with a pilot shortage of mid escalating costs for more we want to bring.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,43,2022-11-04 16:43:47
4856," And rejecting contracts this week negotiations derailed by the pandemic now growing tense as the industry contends with a pilot shortage amid escalating costs. For more, we want to bring in Captain Dennis Tejer, allied pilots association spokesperson. And this union represents 15,000 American Airlines pilots. Dennis, it's great to have you. So let's start with American Airlinesers. And you are representing the 15,000 pilots of that carrier voted against the tentative agreement this week. Why? Well, our leadership actually took what was in place and reviewed it and said it didn't get anywhere near meeting what our membership expect for a contract. And it's not just about the money. There's a market rate for pilots. It's gone up dramatically. Inflation has cut away at our purchasing power. We watch Alaska national carrier versus us as a global carrier, just settle a deal. And importantly, they went up 20 plus percent on their pay rates. But the number one issue for our pilots is work life balance and scheduling practices and the Alaska pilots work with their management team to execute a deal that will not only take care of that need for the pilots, but actually freeze them up to do even more flying and keeps the schedule more reliable. You know, on this program on a financial side, you know what an airline cancels flights. It affects the unit costs because it's less ASM seat available seat miles out there. Right now, American by having all these canceled flights is actually increasing their costs and they haven't even gotten a value out of it if they had actually invested in a pilot contract. So we're going to get this done, but it's not going to be done on the cheap. It's not going to be done with a low level investment because the revenue opportunity out there is unlike anything we've ever seen. Just listen to the quarterly calls every CO saying record revenue and passenger demand like they've never seen before even in the so called shoulder months. So then how many of these issues were already brewing before COVID really put a lot more pressure on pilots and an airline workers as well versus some of the more specific things that are now coming out. So great question. These some of these issues were Fisher cracks within the foundation of operation through management's in attention to that, but the pandemic when they did not keep pilots trained they retired airplanes early and didn't retrain pilots for that. That furloughed pilots had early returbs. I think I might have mentioned that bottom line was they had this wave of pilot training that they never did, which is part of the $54 billion investment promise. That part they're still catching up from so what they've done is they saw the revenue coming in the demand they didn't expect that to come back till 2024. Well, they were an outlier because we saw it coming along with many analysts. So what happened is now they just dumped in ticket sales even Delta admitted they just went for the revenue and they overplayed it. So now they have a system that is not trusted that has been pushed to the edge and the things that they did to try and keep it rolling they continue to try and do that. They schedule us to the maximum with very little buffer and we go illegal flight cancels where they pushes to the point of exhaustion where by FAA law, we cannot fly when we're fatigued and we have to make the right call for safety and actually fatigue off of a flight. These are all undermining the reliability and the revenue stream not to mention the brand damage and it's also pushing on a margin of safety. We're going to defend that margin of safety so no passenger has to worry about that, but we're human and the first thing that goes when you fatigue is your judgment. It's a vicious cycle and it's got to be stopped and some of the answers are in our contract. I can guarantee you that working with us is going to be a lot less expensive than if you work against us because there's revenue to go get out there and we want to help you harvest that. As you said, it's not just about the money in the latest tentative agreement. It did call for 12% raises for pilots on the date of the contract signing plus 5% after 1 year, 2% after 2 years. Were you satisfied with that part of it or do you want a bigger pay increase? Well, that did not satisfy at all. Number one, we got influxible. What would satisfy us is actually recognizing that the entire regional affiliates are smaller airplanes. They got pay raises up into the 80% range. As we're looking for, we know they're deeply behind. You can get paid more working for regional affiliate, the smaller airplanes and you can for mainline. So upside down, we're going to fix.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,44,2022-11-04 16:48:04
4857," 80% range. And that's not what we're looking for. We know they're deeply behind. You can get paid more working for a regional affiliate, the smaller airplanes, and you can for main line. It's upside down. We're going to fix that. The other side of this is that every contract is up for negotiations now. Son Zalaska, who settled, you're not going to be left behind. Do your management team. You're not going to be the outlier. And I got news for you, we will have snapups because we're all negotiating in this narrow band of time. If someone gets a little bit higher pay rate, you're not going to be an outlier by providing that because we are going to have a snapup that brings us there. It's becoming the industry standard. And all this the convergence of the pandemic, the recovery and these contract negotiations make it a very safe and compelling time to negotiate modern deals with pilots. It's going to be a commoditized not only on a pay rate basis, but actual utilization rate. It's all right here, and it's actually going to be good for the industry. We just have to get management to join us so that we can point all of our energy toward making a better product, put more flights out there, which will actually help ease the unit costs. The more ASMG have out there, we get this business and we want to be a part of it in a functional way, but we will not be exploited while management tries to figure out how to modernize their operation. We'll certainly be keeping track of how talks are progressing a big thank you allied pilots association spokesperson Captain Dennis Tager. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, shares of Starbucks trading higher off reporting those fourth quarter earnings there up almost 3% where British securities managing director Nick Setchen joins us to help break those numbers down. Good to have you back, Nick. Now, we know you had a neutral rating on the stock and a price target of $92. What did you like in this earnings report? Well, the US comp is clearly on fire here, including positive transactions. So, you know, the company is able to pass on 10% you know, average check growth and still manage to get 1% positive transactions. That that that's clearly bucking the trying to earn the restaurant industry. And then on top of that, you know, despite the China was the rest of international X China is doing better as well. So the rest of the markets like Japan, South Korea are actually carrying China along, right? I mean, so the consensus estimate for international, including China was down eight came in down around six. So beat on international as well despite China headache. And Nick, that's interesting here because clearly the results are very strong. Once you take out the weakness that we are seeing out of China. But as we enter the next couple of months, which at least from now looks like it's going to be pretty choppy. We could see more of a significant slowdown here in the US where Starbucks clearly outperformed last quarter. What's your read on what we could see this current quarter and looking ahead into next year? Well, so I mean, I expect the guidance to be very positive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,45,2022-11-04 16:52:24
4858," What's your read on what we could see this current quarter and looking ahead into next year? Well, so I mean, I expect the guidance to be very positive, relative to expectations. The question is, despite the guidance, what actual results will look like as the year progresses, in the near term, at least through the first half of their fiscal year, so the holiday season and on fiscal Q1 ending in March or calendar Q1 ending in March, I expect them to continue to have high-singlisher comps in the US, even with negative transactions. So I see very little risk to current expectations around FY 23. And Nick, a lot of people are looking for some cues as to how the consumer is feeling about things. Doesn't seem to be the case though, for Starbucks, even same store sales growth, up 11% people also spending more higher foot traffic. Then what do you think consumers are driven to Starbucks, whereas we're seeing some other retailers really struggling? Well, you know, an interesting thing is restaurants across the board have been doing very well this quarter, not a single restaurant, with the exception of a couple of, you know, company-specific cases has missed so far, with about 85% of restaurants reporting. So every single restaurant, practically every single restaurant has beaten expectations and has given very solid guidance, especially around the top line. And that's being driven number one by an extraordinary price increase, we increase, but even with those big price increases, the gap versus growth rate is expanding. So growth rate prices are seeing higher year growth rates than the restaurants number one. So that's helping restaurants become a relative value as ironic as that sounds. And then two, we're still benefiting, restaurants are still benefiting from this. You know, I don't want to stay home, I want to go out and enjoy experiences as opposed to, you know, ordering goods online. And so restaurants continue to benefit from that tail as well. Nick, what about the price increases over the last 12 months? We've seen prices rise by about 5% do you think more in store? I think more in store, but I do think that because grocery starts, grocery prices are rising faster, restaurants are not in danger as much as, you know, first-plush might indicate. All right, always good to have you on Nick's set to live. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. The Wall Street Journal and Realtor.com collaborate on the emerging housing markets index, which considers battle and return on real estate investment, economic health and quality of life. And with the population just over 70,000 Johnson City Tennessee came out on top. Johnson City Mayor Joe Wise with us now on the economy and the housing market. Good to see you, Mr. Mayor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,46,2022-11-04 16:56:45
4859," Since city Tennessee came out on top, Johnson City mayor Joe Wise with us now on the economy and the housing market and good to see you Mr. Mayor and the obvious question is the wagon wheel song by Darius Rucker or number one on the Wall Street Journal emerging markets list. What was a bigger deal there in Johnson City? Well, we've had more time to think about the wagon wheel song, but we certainly find the both the exciting references, I suppose. Mayor, what do you attribute all this excitement to the fact that people are coming from all over the country? It sounds like having interest in your relatively small city. What's driving that? I think there are a number of factors that have contributed to it. We've as a city made a sustained investment in infrastructure and particularly the deployment of direct fiber to every residents and business in our community to provide 10 gig internet. So that makes it a place that people can work remotely in a time when people are contemplating working remotely. But then alongside of those things are quality of life considerations that were home to East Tennessee State University that offers doctoral programs and medicine pharmacy and nursing and physical therapy and many other allied and health science fields. And so with that comes the parallel medical community with a local children's hospital, a level one trauma center. And so folks can come to Johnson City and find in a relatively modest sized town the resources, the services and the quality of life features and amenities that you might associate with significantly larger cities than Johnson City. And Mary, we just had the average price, the median home price in your city up on the screen. Now, $379,000 that's up from $350,000 just three months ago, up significantly on a year over your basis. What do you make of the dynamics that's playing out in the housing market in your city? What we could potentially see to prices here in the coming quarters? Well, that's something we're mindful of every good news has some consequences that may not always be favorable. And so we're aware of the potential risk to affordability and potentially the concerns around the quality of life that might be changed if we had a significant influx. And so as a community and as a city, we're making very deliberate efforts to look at growth management and making sure that when when all the dust settles, the things that made Johnson City desirable as a place to live remain true of Johnson City for those who live here now and those who might live here in the future. How did the pandemic actually boost the economy boost the real estate of your town? Well, I think remote work, you know, we began the process of deploying the 10 gig internet through our local energy authority years ago before we knew there would be a pandemic in 2020. And so really we were readying a capacity for remote workers, particularly long before the culture had an inclination to really be pursuing it the way we've seen over the last several years. And once people returned to office, how do you make sure people stay and don't leave Johnson City? Well, I think part of that is proximity. We're at the crossroads of interstates 26 and 81. We are within about a days drive of virtually everybody in the eastern half of the United States. And so for a lot of professionals, a community like Johnson City provides them the best of both worlds, we're only a few hours from places like Charlotte or Nashville or Atlanta. And so if your job doesn't require you to physically be in a specific location Monday to Friday, which lots of people's jobs do not, this might just be the right fit. Based upon the video I'm seeing, sir, I have got to come visit Johnson City Tennessee Mayor Joe Wise. We'll be against that. We will come see it.

I think journalism is still a really noble profession. The problem is so much of journalism has seeped into commentary. I hope that I'll be seen as somebody you know who did what my father told me my entire life. Do your best and that's what I've done. Hello everyone I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to Influencers and welcome to our guest Katie Kourik a course former host of the Today Show CBS evening news co-founder of Katie Kourik Media and author of the book going there and my former colleague at Yahoo which we'll get to. I'm sure Katie welcome great to see you. Hi Andy great to be here thanks for having me. Of course. Why don't we start out before we talk about the book. I'm curious to know about Katie Kourik Media and what you're up to and what's that all about? Well I love sort of being the boss of me as our kids used to say Andy and about three and a half years ago my husband and I saw that the media landscape was changing dramatically. I actually noticed that over the past decade or so and instead of depending on you know people to give me a job I decided I wanted to be a job creator. I wanted to try my hand at being an entrepreneur and that I thought the brand that I had established over 30 to 40 years in media was as powerful as some of the bigger brands and would be enable me to really personalize the news and view it from my perspective. So we decided to be pan media. We have a newsletter that goes over goes out to well over half a million people with a very high engagement rate. We have a podcast. I'm going to be recruiting other talent to contribute and we already have done that. We have somebody who's our book editor. We have a very vibrant relationship with Bobby Brown also used to be at Yahoo and so we're really establishing a collective of voices and in the meantime I'm also developing documentaries. I have a couple of scripted projects in development. I was an executive producer of a series on Netflix called Unbelievable and I wanted to realize Andy is storytelling has changed dramatically. It's no longer siloed. You can and a dissentral mediation allows you to go direct to consumer just as brands are doing and we now have about 35 people working at the company and really what I'm trying to do we also have a shop that you know has picks of what we think are purpose driven brands and female founded by pop founded LGBTQ plus founded companies that we're supporting and really shining a light on. So it's been really exciting because you know it's hard working for a big lumbering bureaucratic organization at times and I find that I can be much more nimble and I can create content at the drop of the hat a drop of a hat or I can do longer profiles and series and really explore topics I'm interested in that I think are worthy of a listener or reader or viewer's attention. What do you think about TV news right now Katie and you know we're seeing the emergence of streaming services like CNN plus and what does that mean for the industry how would you describe it? Well I think it's just another way to provide interesting content to consumers. You know it'll be interesting to see if people are going to pay for those services when there is so much news.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,48,2022-11-04 17:05:21
4861," You know, it'll be interesting to see if people are going to pay for those services when there is so much news everywhere. I mean, I'm just inundated with with news 24 seven and a lot of it is really high quality. I was just reading a great piece this morning on Joe mansion and the rolling stone that someone brought my attention to. So I think it'll be an interesting experiment to see if people are going to want that content. Well, they want to see Chris Wallace doing interviews. I'm not sure maybe hardcore Chris Wallace fans will but it seems to me that there is so much news. It's so ubiquitous now that they're going to have to provide something that is really unique. And I think they're trying to do that with sort of the model of Anthony Bourdain, which, you know, was established on CNN many years ago with evil on Goria, you know, I just I just don't know at what point I guess is the content overload Andy, you know, is there just so much to choose from will the cream still rise through the top probably but will it be enough to sustain some of these newer business models. I'm not sure. Right, and then ubiquity is both the blessing and the curse from the consumer standpoint because there is so much out there, but then how do you choose. And so I'm sure you're asked this question Katie people asked me all the time, what do you look at what do you read and how do you decide what to look at when there is so much stuff. Well, you know, I do rely primarily on newsletters and on Apple news and, you know, I remember when I was at Yahoo with you Andy, I begged for them to let me start a newsletter that would basically go straight to people's inboxes and help kind of curate the things they needed to know. You know, they they weren't interested in that at Yahoo for a variety of reasons, which we can talk about later and sort of what Yahoo's ultimate business goals were at the time, but, you know, I read a lot of news letters. I try to read the economists I look at time magazine I read the New York Times, the Washington Post, I read various news letters from reporters from those outlets. I read the pointer institute Tom Jones does a media newsletter the Pew Center research center does kind of what's going on in media interested in kind of looking at trends I read the information by Jessica lesson. So I really try to get a good cross section of helpful and useful information and sometimes I just look at Apple news and see what's trending and if there are articles that I'm interested in. And I feel like I really get a good sense of what's going on in the world with the a malgum of sources that I turn to. you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,49,2022-11-04 17:09:36
4862," you you you you today want to with these m water, so important. And I think it, you know, you can't just wave a magic wand. It's, it, there's, there's so many factors, I think, contributing to this imbalance of power that have been entrenched in our society for decades, if not centuries. And so one of the things that I hope we can do is have honest conversations about this. I think that's so imperative. And if my book models that, then that's something I'm really pleased about. Because I think what happens is, you know, there's, there's, there's progress and then there's a backlash. There's progress and then there's a backlash. And I think having open and honest conversations and not, you know, canceling people because they say the wrong thing or not rejecting them out of hand because the way that they see things which and their products of their own environments is a really important component to leveling the playing field for everyone. You write a course about, we talked about Matt Lauer or I mentioned him, I should say in the problems, and let's moon this, are men in TV and entertainment worse than other businesses? Or is it just that they're more high profile? You know, it's hard for me to answer that question Andy because I haven't really been in other businesses. But having said that, I do think they're more high profile. I think there's probably a little more, you know, it's not exactly a low-key or low-profile industry. So I think probably the ego level, men in television in general and sort of media is probably feeds into or fed, excuse me, fed into certain behavior for many, many years. So I think that, you know, I think it was just sort of business as usual. It was sort of the status quo for this kind of behavior. I think it was not only tolerated, but in some cases encouraged in television news, and especially as women were entering.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,50,2022-11-04 17:13:55
4863," not only tolerated, but in some cases encouraged in television news and especially as women were entering that industry and significant numbers. I think we forget that, you know, I graduated from college Andy in 1979 and this was when women were really entering the workplace in big numbers. And so it was male dominated for quite a while. Women were in positions that were dependent on their male bosses. So that created a dynamic that just, I think, opened up for a lot of abuses. That, and add to that kind of the culture that existed. You know, a bit of Hollywood, we're going to make you a star. I control your fate. You are subservient to me. And I think that provided a recipe for that kind of really unacceptable behavior. And then you give them come back or should they be allowed to come back or talk about canceling people and people paying the price. I think a lot of it depends on your response to the allegations. I think people who recognize, I think James Franco did something very interesting that we haven't seen with a lot of these men who had been. I think that I don't know we could have a whole conversation of the word canceled. You know, I think they were removed with cause. You know, I think canceled sometimes suggests that a small. You know, a smaller or or infraction or whatever was overly penalized. So I think James Franco talked about, you know, getting help acknowledging his issues and trying to understand the damage that he did. And I think that other people should probably take a page from that playbook and do some serious introspection and then try to kind of contribute to, you know, be the change they that we hope to see. Instead of kind of digping in in their heels. But, you know, I think I think with any kind of social movement there, there is bound to be some collateral damage. Good, good point about how I use the word canceled, by the way. Well, I mean, I know I appreciate that. No, you are spot on. You know, you are, you are spot on. I want to switch over and get back to some of those tech companies in the platforms a little bit, because they're so powerful. And, you know, you're relying on them. We're relying on them. We're one of them in a way. But Facebook, Twitter. How are you thinking about them, Katie? Are they to blame for the widespread proliferation of misinformation? Should they be held responsible? Should they be broken up? I mean, there are a thousand big questions there, but just your thousand foot take. You know, it's, I wish I were even, you probably are more of an expert on this Andy than I am. I was a co-chair of the Aspen Commission on disinformation. And obviously we took a close look at some of these platforms. I mean, I think the problem with disinformation in our society is very multi-dimensional. But the algorithms and the way things are shared and amplified certainly I think have been, have been fueled by the social media platforms. You know, it's also lack of trust in mainstream media or more traditional media outlets. And also the democratization of information where everyone who has a digital device or iPad or a computer can spread misinformation and disinformation and malinformation. And so I think that we really do need to look, take a close look at the liability of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,51,2022-11-04 17:18:20
4864," And so I think that we really do need to look, take a close look at the liability of some of these platforms that claim they are not a publisher that they're just a platform. And Congress should get involved. I think the federal government needs to have a more unified approach because I don't think there's really a centralized policy arm of the government to deal with this. President Obama says disinformation is the biggest threat to our democracy. Certainly when you look at things like the big lie and the fact that more than 60, you know, courts and judges have said there's no merit to the argument that the election was rigged that it was one of the fairest elections in our history. But the fact that this persists that a huge percentage of the public and particularly the Republican Party continues to believe that the election was rigged. Obviously they're getting this information and it's being reinforced over and over again. And though people gave me a hard time because when I was on Bill Mar, I talked about the need for people to be deprogrammed, which really met just kind of separating themselves from, you know, the information that they're being almost brainwashed to believe through the, you know, repeated serving up of disinformation. I think we need to take a multi-pronged approach and get everyone involved. And I think that people who spread it, who are quote unquote super spreaders, should be held liable for spreading this disinformation, whether it's about COVID or vaccines or about Sandy Hook. And, you know, I think that platforms need to be more aggressive about monitoring it. Of course, the problem and it's not a problem. But the sticky wicked in America is free speech. And how do you balance free speech with the need to have outright lies be, you know, be removed and not not see the light of day. And where unfortunately an audience is receptive to believing them. Yeah, it goes back to the topic is. But it all does go back to can you yell fire in a crowded theater? I mean, it's also timeless. But now it's just this new way of getting the information that sort of, you know, it's a super spreader. And I think the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court said you cannot yell fire. And similarly, you know, I think this is the semantic version of yelling fire in a crowded theater. And, you know, I think, I think the technology has almost outrun the ethical considerations of all this, but it's, it's a really serious problem. I think it's shaping up to even be more serious in 2024. And it's something that, that we need to pay attention to. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,52,2022-11-04 17:22:40
4865," you you you you you I was going to ask you if you would let your kids or tell your kids to get into journalism. But I think one of them is. Yeah. I'm wondering how you feel about that or what you would tell young people are young women and maybe in particular about And there's some amazing high quality, excellent journalism that's being done on a daily basis. So I think journalism is still a really noble profession. The problem is so much of journalism has seeped into commentary. And you know, there's a big argument going on in newsrooms across the country. When should you be an advocate? When should you be a journalist? And is there a way to be both? So, you know, my daughter is working on a documentary about the origin and so the conservative movement and William F. Buckley in particular. And she was an American studies major at Stanford. She is extremely smart. And I think exploring this is really, really interesting and really important. And so I think that we need to have great people attracted to journalism. We need smart, curious young people, men and women. And people who represent this country demographically. So we're talking about people from all kind of socio-economic backgrounds, Andy, people from different, who've had different experiences. Because of their race and ethnicity, we need to be kind of this great American will, you know, by between 44 white people will be in the minority in this country. And we just need to make sure that our journalists represent the people they're serving. Having said that, I do think we need to look at the model of journalism. And I know a lot of people are thinking about this and talking about it. And we need to be restored trust in the media. How can we be less polarized and speak to just one audience or the other? I think that's a really challenging question. But I think it's one that deserves a lot of attention and thought. And I think we need a lot of people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,53,2022-11-04 17:26:53
4866," I think that's a really challenging question, but I think it's one that deserves a lot of attention and thought, and I think we need a lot of people, young people, smart young people, who can maybe look at it and look at it in a different way. And are we forever going to be siloed and have our own information? My friend Nicole Seligman talks about affirmation instead of information. I think these are all big, head-e-medie topics, and we need the greatest minds in the country to focus on them. So I would encourage people, especially idealistic people to go into journalism. Great, we're almost at a time, Katie. So quickly, if you can, what do you see as your legacy? Well, I hope that I contributed to the national conversation and help people understand complicated issues. I hope that I helped show that women were capable, and that it's interesting to think about the fact that in 2006, it was such a big deal to have a woman do the evening news. And now we see the evening news is declining in terms of its influence and importance. They still have a lot of people watching, but much older demographics. And I think very few young people are watching the network evening newscast. But I hope that I helped move the ball a little bit forward for women. Wasn't easy, I write extensively about my experience at CBS. And I think I was met with a lot of resistance there, partially because I think, well, there are a whole lot of reasons which I detail in the book. But I hope that I moved the ball forward for women, whether it was asking that I had a 50-50 division of labor on the today's show with Brian Gumball or took the leap and became the first solo female anchor of an evening newscast. And I also hope that I try to explore important topics and do it honestly. And that I have the vulnerability and humility to say when there were times when I didn't get it right, I don't know any journalists who batted 1,000 for decades. And I think that, you know, I'm proud of myself that I had the courage to say, maybe I could have done something differently or why did I approach a topic this way? Or here were some of the factors that were influencing me when I was making decisions because when all is said and done, journalists are human beings. They're not perfect. They try, I think, to do the best job they can mostly. And so I hope that I'll be seen as somebody, you know, who did what my father told me my entire life, do your best and that's what I've done. And sometimes, you know, it's been great and sometimes I've fallen on my face. But to me, that's kind of a life well lived. And the ability to admit that is, I think, takes a lot of guts.

First let's get to Brad at the Wi-Fi interactive Brad all right Let's take a look at the Dow Jones industrial average kick things off at this the top of the 10 a.m Hour on this Friday congrats you made it to the end of the week here Dow Jones is up by about 1% right now Now as that composite you're seeing that higher by a little more than 1% as well the SCP 500 You're also seeing that hold on to gains by about 1.1% Let's just put this in a five-day context to see how the week is rounding out overall S&P 500 over the past five days still lower by about 3.5% Nasdaq composite that too in the red actually the deepest declineer of the US major averages this week And then additionally you're seeing the Dow Jones industrial average over the past five days still lower But solid movement at least to end out this trading week and that's on the back of today's jobs report Also taking a look first at the sectors now come back to this retail and apparel segment for a hot second in a moment But the sector activity that we're seeing here on the day We've gotten a little more mixed and actually now we have more laggards than Advancers here take a look energy is up 3% here on the day and actually let's put this in an intraday view and now we're in The correct correlation there to today's activity all 11 S&P 500 sectors in positive territory And then just briefly going back to those apparel names that we've been tracking as there's been some fresh news out of Adidas as they've named a new CEO Bjorn golden going to become the CEO of Adidas and so Adidas is up by about 14% right now At least the shares that trade overseas are right now so we'll continue to watch that but moving forward here on the day The US has added 261,000 jobs in October while unionizing efforts continue to make its way through the labor market Starbucks made one of many companies all too familiar with workers unionization efforts. Here's what's the F.O Rachel Regeri had to say on the matter We truly believe a side-by-side relationship with our partner is the very best path forward But we respect the process what we're focused on is continuing to create the very best experience for our partners We know that that has worked for the last 50 years and we're confident It actually underpins the success of our new era of growth. So that's where we're focused And to take a closer look at the labor movement in the US and workers rights We have Mary Kay Henry international president of the service employees International Union. Thank you so much for taking the time here with us this morning First and foremost just got to get your reaction to what you heard from the Starbucks CFO Well, if that was the case Then workers would be at a bargaining table and being able to have a say directly on the job and instead the Starbucks Is choosing to fight tooth and nail closed stores when people unionize and we really Welcome the day when the CFO's comments are the reality with Starbucks because the partners love that company And they want to see at the table and a voice on the job and to be respected protected and paid what they're worth Mary Kay, Julie here. I'm curious if you've ever had an experience where a company has said Come on in. Let's yes, we're happy to have union to your let's negotiate I mean, is it is it much more the norm to have more of an an adversarial relationship? Well, there's been periods in American history where employers have said Come on in when Kaiser Permanente was founded in the 40s in California It opened as a healthcare Provider that all the jobs were union and today they have the highest patient satisfaction and the Employee satisfaction in the healthcare sector Harley Davidson it was a conflict with those workers, but now the United Steel workers and Harley Davidson have a very Good relationship and the company's profitable. So it's true I think what you're saying the norm in the US economy is for corporations to resist Workers who want to join together and we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,55,2022-11-04 17:35:38
4868," is for corporations to resist. Workers who want to join together, and we're seeing a historic wave of unionization efforts that I believe are driving wages up, even though wage growth is slowing, as we have this terrific jobs report this month. And I think that's why we're going to continue to see workers joining together at Starbucks, Amazon, fast food, airports, and across the service and care sector, because people want to turn poverty wage jobs into good jobs that they can raise their families on. Mary Kay, what would getting it right look like for Starbucks? Are you talking $25 an hour and a guaranteed 40 hours a week? Well, getting it right would be recognizing the union at the 250 stores that have already voted to join the union and allowing workers who want to file for elections. The ability to do it without their managers interfering with it or changing their schedules or moving people around stores. The continued anti-union campaign should stop. That would be a way to get it right. And then ultimately, it would be terrific if Starbucks would break with major corporations in the US and do what they do in other countries around the world and set a national bargaining table where there could be a standard as you're suggesting that the workers and the corporation could figure out together. This is in a climate where corporate profits are at an all-time high, highest in 70 years. And so that's why I think the Starbucks and Amazon organizing is connected to the economic health of major corporations here in this country and around the world. And it's why things would go so much better if employers would stop resisting the union and start respecting the right of workers to decide for themselves whether they want to be in a union. Well, it's also driven by the workers' shortage. It's hard to find people to fill those positions. And so we've seen this period of a little bit more of the power being put back in the workers' hands. But that might be about to shift again. If we're heading into a recession, if we are going to see the job market turn around in the next year. So could that also change the dynamics for unions? I actually think what's driving workers to join together in unions is beyond the shortage. And is about the two-year pandemic that people just work their way through and had the experience of their co-workers get hardest hit by the pandemic because people were showing up every day, often without the personal protective equipment they needed. And I think when people continue to work and we're facing life and death choices, I've heard this directly from nurses, retail workers, fast food workers, they've decided that when their employer started to resist them and threaten their job, that was like, okay, if you're going to threaten to fire me, after I just spent two years risking my life to show up to work, then I probably don't need this job. And that's why I'm going to join together with my co-workers and create a collective bargaining agreement so that workers can be respected on the job, protected in their health, and paid what they're worth. Mary Kay Henry, SEIU, International President, good to see you. Have a great weekend. Thank you. All right, the U.S. economy created 261,000 jobs in the month of October. Let's get more of a pulse on the jobs market with U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. Marty, always good to see you here this morning. You're taking these job numbers. I mean, certainly, they're good job numbers with low unemployment. I like seeing that every month. And what was starting to see, I think, is nice as a slow-steady growth in our economy. And I think that we're not getting, certainly, the slowdown that a lot of people want to see or alleging they need to bring the inflationary pressures down. But I think we are sat in the sea slow-steady growth as we move forward here. Do you believe that we'll see more people come back into the workforce, those who have perhaps sat on the sideline for one reason or another, whether that's childcare, or whether that's the coronavirus pandemic and workplace issues, whatever that may be, that they'll start to come back into the workforce. If we do see a deep recession or at least a more pronounced recession. I think we'll definitely see more people go back into the workforce. I mean, there's lots of job openings in the country right now. And, you know, we were talking about that this morning, what I went out of the office in BLS is to see with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,56,2022-11-04 17:40:05
4869," We're back into the workforce. I mean, there's lots of job openings in the country right now and, you know, we're talking about that this morning, what I was, what I went out of the office and BLS is to see where the job openings are and, you know, when you think about job openings, the largest job openings in our country are in lower paying jobs. They're in, you know, hospital, in hospitality industries. And yet, we're starting to see people come back into the workforce and they have higher skills and degrees and they're looking to get into better paying jobs. So right now, as we move forward here, we've got to make sure we're partnering jobs with people and what their ability to do is, and I think that that's something that we have to really think about moving forward. At least that's what I'm thinking about moving forward here at the Department of Labor. Marty, maybe some of those people going to be in these jobs will be laid off software engineers. I don't know because we're hearing about, or people who are looking for job in that sector and there's not that job anymore. We're hearing about a lot of tech companies that are either cutting or freezing hiring right now. There's just a report that Elon Musk now that he owns Twitter is going to cut 3,700 people there. I know that you had talked to Musk in the past regarding his build out in Texas for Tesla. Now he's cutting jobs in his other business and his newly acquired business. I'm just curious what you think about that sort of flow of jobs there. Well, certainly one thing in this jobs report that's not reflected yet in this. Certainly I'm keeping a close eye on that because I dig the tech sector in the United States over the last several years, certainly has grown. Those are good paying jobs and those are jobs that are in lots of cities like Austin, Texas, Boston, Massachusetts, out in New York and Chicago, places like that. We have to dive into that a little more. We haven't seen, I don't think a lot of life's here, but there's been lots of talk of layoffs and freezing hiring. So, certainly that's something that would concern me because they have good paying jobs and a lot of states and cities and places around the country have built out expansion of their cities, whether building new housing, things like that. It's for this sector, this tech sector. So it's something that I'm interested in. I'm going to dive more into and certainly offering right now to any tech company out there, anything that we can do at the Department of Labor to help you in a situation. I'd love to do that. As far as Twitter, I mean, that's a whole different situation. I don't know enough about it, but I think that's Elon Musk and looking at the business model. I'm sure at some point that will fix itself out as it moves forward. While we have you, we do know that there's been a move from New York City, this recent, of course, in the salary transparency that's come forward, and regardless of what's started, it's gotten off to. I think there is still this broader recognition that there can be more room for salary transparency that is beneficial to both the employee and the employer. What would you like to see on that front as New York City has already rolled this out, but perhaps where some other cities and states could also have that type of transparency that leads to a more healthy employer, employee relationship and kind of reduces some of the parity issues in pay scale? Yeah. Well, we did that in Boston. When I was in the mayor of Boston, we had 200 companies in the city that gave us the pay data and anonymously were able to dissect it and really work on pay equity and making sure that women and men were paid the same. We made some really good gains in the city of Boston. It wasn't heavy handed. The companies came to the table. These are the large corporations. And I think having these conversations are really important. And coming up with policies moving forward or important, we were successful in the city of Boston. They're still hopefully still doing it in the city of Boston. And now the place is it really is about having these conversations and not just in pay equity and transparency, but also in leadership of companies and getting women on boards and things like that. All of those, you know, those are important aspects of growth and moving forward. You know, legislation has passed often about pay equity. We shouldn't, women shouldn't need legislation to be paid the same as a man. Women should be paid the same as a man for doing the same exact work. And that's something that, not just elected officials, but CEOs of companies should work on. And the way to the time has come to make this make make equity in the workplace consistent. Mr. Secretary, this jobs report just continues a string of really solid to strong labor market reports, but it comes against the backdrop of slowing or declining productivity in this country. I do you think the hustle culture this country was founded on is just done. Yeah. I went up. My name's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,57,2022-11-04 17:44:31
4870," in this country. I do you think the hustle culture, this country was founded on, is just done. Yeah, my economy just went over that with me yesterday and I was trying to get a good reason on how we measure productivity in the United States America. And I think that we're still working through that. I mean, I think the productivity America is strong. I think that when the terminology of quiet quits came up or all of that happening, I never heard it in the communities. I haven't heard it when I was out there talking. I think American workers are still working strong. They're working, getting paid. I've been on a lot of construction sites. I've been in a lot of manufacturing facilities. Those workers aren't slowing down. Those workers are working hard. So I think that, you know, again, I don't know enough about the data. I don't think the data is consistent or strong as it should be to really tell the true story of American workers. All right, we'll leave it there. US Labor Secretary, Mari Walsh, Walsh, always good to see you. Have a great weekend. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. And we'll be right back. Now it's some other headlines that we're watching at this hour. The Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, or PIF, says it will make electric cars in the kingdom under a joint venture with Apple supplier FoxCarn.

4871," Available in 2025 and CIR is projected to contribute $8 million to the Kingdom's GDP by 2034. Chrysler parent Stellantis warning nearly 300,000 vehicle owners immediately to stop driving their cars after three crash deaths tied to faulty Takata airbagging flaters were reported in the last seven months. The Do Not Drive warning is currently in place for owners of previously recalled 2005 to 2010 Dodge Magnum Station wagon. Dodge Challenger Coops and Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans that had not addressed that airbag issue. And Aldi is doing a Thanksgiving price rewind in an effort to draw customers to its chain amid surging inflation. The grocery retailer lowered prices for its Thanksgiving dinner food items to match 2019 prices. That means discounts of up to 30% for select items. If you recall, we reported earlier this week that Walmart announced a similar pricing strategy, but they're just rolling it back to last year's prices. That would be about a 15% discount. So Aldi saying, no, no, no, no, we're going all the way back to 2019. Hold my turkey. Wait a minute. Something like that. Hold the gravy, whatever. Anyway, it has been a rough year for the semiconductor sector first companies such as AMD and Nvidia could not get enough chips to supply customers. And now slowing PC sales are hurting the industry. Shares of chip makers, they've been sliding all year and it could get worse. So Z is here with his take on this one. Yeah, nothing like dumping this negativity on a day when all the chip stocks are up. And nonetheless, highlighting a good note from cities, Chris Daly, really one of my favorite chip analysts out there on Wall Street. He's offering up some good reasons why the sell-off and chip stocks and the socks index or the Philadelphia semiconductor index might be really ripe for further another sell-off here. First, industrial end market demand is rolling over red flag there as well. Auto sales are in fact cooling. A lot of chips, of course, get used in various automobiles. PC and handset demand are correcting. We've heard that. We have heard that within the past two weeks from the likes of an Intel and an AMD. That PC correction is alive and well and it has been very ugly for a lot of players. And even too, the handset market as well has been correcting as we've learned from Qualcomm's warning yesterday. And then lastly, companies are more tightly managing capital expenditures. It is full on. It continues to be budget planning season in corporate America. And we're starting to see a lot of, I would just say tighter cap X budgets for next year. Maybe that means a fewer less chips. Now of course, there you can see that Philadelphia semiconductor index on the screen right there. That has been, it has not been a good year for that, not a good year for an AMD and Nvidia and many other players in that semiconductor index. Daily things, EPS estimates for chip stocks can tank at least another 20% from where they are now. That would be a big plunge and likely put further pressure to his point on the stocks and that the stocks index could plunge at least 15% as those earnings estimates come down. And my take here in search for bottom, you know, it definitely brings up a couple good points on what would ultimately cause that bottom in chip stocks. For him, it is the end market no longer correcting, valuation just reaching levels that are truly trough and no more cap X cuts. And I'm trying to figure out why I'm in a basket. Is that what that is? I think that's a basket of trash can. It's a trash can. Wow. That's a waste. Wow, that's a waste. That's awesome. That looks like a wicker basket, like a laundry wicker basket. It's a trash can. I feel like I made it. And it's a trash can. It's a trash can. Okay. Well, we'll see what happens with chips. I mean, you know, it depends on the time horizon you look at. Because it's interesting when you talk to some investors and they say the, you know, chips obviously we're still going to meet them. Yes. And so if you're an investor who's looking at five years, ten years, you might have, if you have that luxury, you might have a different sort of assessment here of what this group looks like. Yeah. Look, AMD's business is still growing. Qualcomm is still growing. It's just a matter of, they're not growing at the rates that they were and the growth rates have really, really, really stalled. I think that Qualcomm report was just not good on many accounts this week. Yeah. And signal a lot of things, many of which you pointed out and you're taking today's hours. Appreciate it. Guys coming up, payment platform round up. We're going to break down the earnings from Block and PayPal with BTIG's Mark Palmer. Let's come up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,59,2022-11-04 17:53:14
4872," is Payment platforms block and PayPal. They are on the move today, but in divergent ways. After PayPal cut its full year revenue forecast while block, so a 51% pop in its cash at business year over year. BTIG, managing director Mark Palmer, joins us now. Mark, great to get some of your perspective here on these two fintech names. Now we're seeing the stocks react in very different ways here, but of course the company is saying something very different about what their forecasts may look like. Perhaps we can start with a block. Key takeaways and what was the catalyst kind of going forward for them that is different from PayPal? Yes, thanks very much for having me on today. Block is in a very different position than PayPal. Especially because through its cash app, it is offering a bank account substitute to consumers, particularly in the lower end of the income spectrum, who really benefit from those types of services, especially to time when a lot of banks focusing on their own profitability are growing up the gates and letting less consumers to start bank accounts within their platforms. So it's got a mission critical functionality while at the same time, its seller ecosystem, which is basically allowing points of sale payments, has remained robust, which we believe is largely because the company is offering tools to small businesses and medium-sized businesses that enable them to better manage their payment needs. Mark, it's Julie here. It's good to see you talk to me about cash app versus Venmo because I sort of think of those in the same bucket, although I know cash app sort of has broader applications.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,60,2022-11-04 17:57:36
4873," How is this company going to be able to sustain growth? They're guiding initially to 15% earnings growth in 2023. But at the same time, they're making a lot of statements about the vulnerability of their end consumer to an uncertain macroeconomic environment, thus putting that 15% growth in a very risky position right out of the bat. Mark, you're out here this morning, keeping your buy rating on Coinbase F their earnings last night, but taking your price target to $110 from 220. When will this company live up to its promise? Well, I think that's largely a function of what's going to happen in the end market. Coinbase can and is setting its sales, but it can't control the wind. And the wind in this case is the crypto market, which is very much correlated with risk assets in general. And as the federal reserve continues to tighten, the outlook there is very much uncertain. So what are we seeing? We're seeing Coinbase preserve its optionality by focusing on maintaining a large cash balance, building out its institutional prime brokerage platform, and continuing to add new functionality and areas like staking that are relevant to those in the crypto space. So I think what we are seeing now is a lot of building that's going on, not only in Coinbase, but among Web 3 platforms in general, in anticipation of getting a bit more of a tailwind so that you can see the full realization of the platform's potential. BTIG, managing director, Mark Palmer, always good to see you. Have a good weekend. It's a talk to you. Coming up, what's on tap for Disney's earnings next week? We'll break down the top three things you need to know next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,61,2022-11-04 18:05:25
4874," Shares of Corona are getting run over after posting a wireland expected loss for the third quarter. I mean, it's softening demand for pre-owned vehicles. Prosper mating joins us now. Pros, not a good quarter from Carvana, but again, more pressure on the shares here. Yeah, it seems like these high rates are really hurting there. You know, most people with vine ants, there's their cars, 40 million Americans buy used cars every year. Carvana, I'm going to tell you about how this is a rate-sensitive kind of purchase. Like he said, big mists on the top and bottom line. Gross proper vehicle down a thousand bucks, Euro-earned. That's a lot of, that's a huge kind of like decrease in your profit margin there. So, you know, they said things would get worse for them to get any better. So there's not much there for them to kind of like, hopefully hang their head on soon. But, and then in dice going to cake is they suspended their guidance, right? So they can't kind of see what's, what's next given how uncertain things are. So, you know, the Carvana business model has been hurting all year, right? As we've sort of seen things kind of slow down, rates go up. And the question is, is this rock bottom? And then are they going to kind of like, you know, it's a good product, right? It's a really easy thing people like buying their cars online. So it's like, it's got value that the question is, can they make it a profitable venture? We also saw some news this morning that Warren Buffett's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, they're selling shares of a China-based EV maker. So can you tell us more about that? So many years ago, B-Widey, Berkshire bought a pretty significant stake in B-Widey by 20%. They've held on for about 10 years and they started selling little slivers of it, starting late this summer. This is the third, I believe third sale they've done. Another, I think I believe another 3 million shares here. They sold about a million and a half also in September. So it's still, they sell over 200 million shares. So it's still like a significant kind of holding. But the question is, is Warren ready to kind of exit this? If they made a lot of money off this stake, they bought it for 225 million, I think 10 years ago. And now it's over 10 years ago, and now it's worth 7 million, I think. So the question is, when is it time to exit? Does it see it as a long-term Buffett player? Or is it time to sort of like reevaluate? Interesting. We saw those shares rallying just now along with other Chinese stocks during the session. So interesting. Thanks, Frost. Appreciate it. And also looking ahead to the Walt Disney Company next week, it's set to report earnings. We see the shares up about 1.5% or so today. There is a lot going on when it comes to Disney from the parks around the world. Remember, we just had reports of Shanghai Disney being shut for a bit because of COVID there to the streaming landscape here in the US a lot to consider. And considering all of it, is our Alexander Canal who's here with us and said, hey, Ali, so what's the sort of big picture numbers you're going to be looking for? Well, clearly we learned a lot from Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount. And it comes to the state of the market right now, obviously the weakening ad market impacting their bottom line. I expect that to happen to Disney a little bit, but this company has a lot of levers to pull. I spoke with Tim Nolan from a choir. He reiterated his outperform rating earlier this week. He said it's weird having a buy rating on a stock that's down more than 30% year to date, but he did note that over the long term, this company has a lot to look forward to. What you're looking on your screen now is a Wall Street projections. We have a new expected to come in at 21.27 billion, adjust the DPS of 51 cents, parks, experiences and consumer products revenue at 7.59 billion. But a really important number is that operating income. 1.9 billion is expectation. That's less than what we saw in the third quarter, but we could see a little bit of an impact from Hurricane E in there. Perhaps some of that Shanghai Disney closures. And then those Disney plus subscribers expected to come in at 9.35 million. Now what Nolan told me to watch is that direct to consumer subscriber figure. Like I said, 9.5 million expected along with that ad tier expectation. How will that add to the company's bottom line? Nolan estimated that ad revenues could surge up to 800 million in 2023. Thanks to Disney plus, that's sort of the overall market opportunity there. And then on the park side, you want to make sure that gross bookings aren't going down that there's no recessionary impact. The analyst pointed out that in 2009, the last financial crisis, park revenue fell 7%. But there's a bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases to prices, updates to the park, the Disney plus app, etc. And then finally, the impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,62,2022-11-04 18:09:26
4875," A bit of confidence that won't happen in 2023 due to increases, to prices, updates to the park, the Genie Plus app, etc. And then finally, the impact of that advertising slowdown. ESPN I think is pretty insulated from all of that. But ESPN and other big question, right? Looking forward to the company, what's the DTC future of this? Because right now it's clearly more profitable in a linear world than it is in an OTT world. But something that Bob Chapich will have to think about as well. I think there's too much optimism around Disney Plus coming into the report. And keep in mind, this comes against a back to it. Look, we heard from Roku this week. A major slowdown in their business. Netflix, probably some squishy areas in its quarter as well. Power Round Plus, now looking potentially lay people off. It hasn't been a good looking streaming. Hasn't been a good looking streaming. But Disney is not just a streaming company, right? They have a lot of different components to the business. And there's a lot of confidence that they can enter this new world and be very successful at it. If you think about advertising, Disney has a really good base in this. They've really crushed it with Hulu. They have the experience on the linear side. Unfortunately, that adds slowdown. There's not what you can do with that, right? There will be some overhang there. We'll cloud the outlook overall. But overall, I think they're in a good position. They made a lot of investments to Disney Plus. We have a lot of exclusive content that's coming to that service, disenchanted, one of the ones that I'm very excited about that's coming. And I think that content spend is going to slow down significantly over the next few quarters in the next few years. And that's going to positively impact Ipa Tess. So a lot of macro concerns, but I think for this company, they're in a really solid position moving forward. And also with Disney, there's the consideration that on the streaming side too, we could see some more focus around ad tiers at a time where Netflix is rolling out and pulled forward the timeline for themselves to launch that. And so now that we've started to see that pop up in the market and perhaps see what some reception looks like. How have the early days been for Netflix? Well, Netflix just launched their ad here in the US. Yesterday, a $6.99 price point slightly below Disney Plus' upcoming ad supported tier at $7.99. It's going to be a wait and see approach. We're not going to have all the answers this quarter. I think it's going to take a few quarters. So we can really see that impact. I do think across the board, streamers have been exploring price increases. Warner Brothers Discovery on the earnings call last night. They actually pushed up the timeline for that combo service between HBO Max and Discovery to the spring. They said there's a lot of options with pricing sort of hinted that price increases will be coming there. And so pricing is something to really focus on when we think about all of these streaming giants. And I think that's a big component that's going to be important in the quarters to come. Looking forward to Disney. Thanks. So I want to get it. I appreciate it. Coming up, we're going to check in on the state of the restaurant industry and small business. We'll see you at Stockware Company. Lightspeed. That's next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,63,2022-11-04 18:13:55
4876," this So if we're coming to light speed, took a hit this quarter from macro forces, including reduced customer spend at businesses and 4X swing, sitting transaction revenue. But with light speed banking on a move up market, after seeing increased spend, can't it close the sale. The shares are hired today after something yesterday following the numbers and joining us with more is JP Chavez. He is light speed chief executive officer. JP, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. What are you seeing amongst your clients? And we should tell viewers clients are restaurants, but other types of smaller side businesses as well. What are you hearing from them right now? Yeah, so the majority of our customers are restaurants, yours and retailers in the SMB space. And really what we're hearing from them, it's a unique moment in time. The post pandemic world with returned physical has created much more complexity for their businesses because you have the physical world meets the digital world. And also what we're seeing is that it's a cost of labor is gone up, scarcity in terms of trying to hire people and now alluming recession. So it's a really difficult time for our customers and for the market. And here the only way forward for our customers is to adopt technologies like cars that can help them do more with less and automate a lot of the manual tasks. And are they convinced of that, JP? Because as I mentioned, you all had a pretty tough quarter last quarter. You're not just selling software technology to folks. You're also selling hardware in the form of a point of sale system. And are you seeing people retrench or is it just a matter of seeing slower growth? No, so it depends what you call slower growth. We had a 38% growth the year over year. And if you look at the segment of the customers above $500,000, there was 25% growth in store count and above a million dollars, we had a 30% growth. So we are a strong growth player. On what we can control, it was a really good quarter. We beat on also an EBITDA and we beat on the outlook. So for us, it was a very good quarter. What hurt us is what we are planning for in the future. We think there will be a bit of softness, not in terms of our customers and demands, but in terms of the GMV of our customers. And because we are rewarded as a percentage of their revenues, of course, that's going to impact. But still, we are planning very strong growth for the second half of the year. What is the most difficult thing about operating through this particular environment from the CEO perspective? Yeah, well, I mean, this short term versus long term. But light speed, we are a great business, we're building a business that's going to last forever. And then you have the daily fluctuations, investor feelings. But I think for us, the way we look at it, we've outlined the plan, we're ahead of this plan, and we're doing really well. Now there are things we can't control. A currency exchange rates, we do 40% of our business outside of the US. And then the other thing we can't control is consumer buying. But on what we can control, this has been a really good quarter and the business is doing really well. So, IPF, have you followed your colleagues, excuse me, appears in tech and implemented hiring freezes or layoffs? Well, most of the companies that are hiring...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,64,2022-11-04 18:18:19
4877," J.P., have you followed your colleagues, excuse me, appears in tech and implemented hiring freezes or layoffs? Well, most of the companies that are hiring freezes or doing these are not companies that are growing the way we are. These are companies that were pure digital. Light speed, the majority of our businesses have physical presences and as you know, the markets or the consumers have returned to shopping and dining in person. So we are a strong growth story. So we are actually looking today for, I think we have 360 positions open on our website because the company is going to be growing. Now this being said, we have a path to profitability. Next fiscal year, we want to be evict that positive and we plan on doing that, but we have to hire enough people to sustain the growth that we are currently having. And J.P., I'm curious what you're hearing from your clients on the hiring front as well. As you mentioned, restaurants, small retailers, etc. We just got the jobs report today that show they're still growth in things like hospitality jobs, for example. It has gotten easier for these businesses to find people to hire. And that is actually the biggest issue in our industry is that it's very difficult to hire people right now. Most of the people who are working in the hospitality and the retail space found out their jobs during COVID and left the industry and they're having a hard time getting them back into the industry. I think that's really what's hurting our customers right now. And that's why we think it's probably a moment in time and a unique moment in time for light speed because the only way out for our customers because they can't hire enough people is to have platforms that help them automate. And unfortunately for the market, the majority of the systems out there right now are legacy platforms that are really not really efficient in terms of helping them operate in this environment. Have you seen in the data that you're able to kind of glean insights into for all of the businesses that leverage your platform or leverage your service that there is any major pullback or shift at least in the way that businesses are being able to conduct different services whether that be on the food front or whether that be on wherever the platform may be. If the consumers are actually pulling back on their spend or shifting dramatically how they're spending. So for now we haven't well we've seen the big shift we've seen with consumers because we do have also delivery platforms and we also connect with all of the order ahead platforms. What we have seen very clearly is from the end of the pandemic to today there's a very there's a massive return into physical. So that means our customers are selling more and more in their physical spaces. So I think and that's really the complexity right now is that the consumers are still consuming online. They're still using delivery and order ahead but they're also consuming in the physical space which means that for the customers it's more difficult than ever to manage these. And so you often see it you know when you go into restaurants and they have four or five iPads and each of every iPad is for you know different delivery network or and that's where we can help them we can go in and integrate those platforms and make it much simpler for them to run their businesses. So we have seen this big shift and then on a on a consumer basis what we've seen is summer was very strong for hospitality. We've seen a lot of people just return to restaurants and we're starting to see a slight slowdown in terms of of consuming but we are still you know in very healthy healthy volumes. JP JP great to have you here with us this morning JP Showway who is the light speed chief executive officer here with us on Yahu Finance appreciate the time. Thanks for having me.

4878," אך collaborator..... Thank you. You You Welcome back. It's time for time and today we focus in on three separate earnings reports. One minute each. Let's start with this on the day. Shares of Funko ticker symbol FNK. Oh, it's down bad right now after missing. Yeah. Oh my gosh indeed. Missing on profit estimates and slashing guidance, reducing their profit forecast ahead of the holidays. Shares moving in a manner that would make everyone bobble their head. As we're taking a look at the activity on the day, it's down by 50% here. Shrug? Stunning. It's not, you know, I don't think the demand met the company's expectations. We should also note that J.P. Morgan now downgrading the stock. I guess that would happen when your stock loses 50%. But they are implementing a lot of new, I think, just processes and machines and technology inside the company to set their foundation for whatever they're looking to do. But this is a massive, massive day of value destruction for Funko. It seems like it's not as much the sales that are a problem. It's the profitability that's the problem. The EPS and EBITDA really had a big miss here. And the company is now expecting an adjusted EBITDA margin in high single digits for the full year. Previous guidance was around 14.6%. If you look at the midpoint, so that's a big downgrade. Virgin Galactic, we're watching those shares as well. They're up 6% after reporting a wider than expected loss for the third quarter. It did top revenue projections. And most importantly, reaffirmed. It remains on track to launch space tourism services in the second quarter of 2023. And it's going to have its commercial spacecraft going up in the middle of next year. I mean, earning shmurnings for this thing. It doesn't obviously make any money yet. But it's all about the timeline here going forward. So that sort of confirmation is encouraging. No, you're making face problems. So it's going to take its space. It's going to take its to go into sub-oantorecession. Right into recession. Like my goodness. And it's economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,66,2022-11-04 18:26:39

It's really been Turn around story that they've needed to initiate from Exploring bankruptcy all the way to okay. How do we just make sure that with any titles that make it into our theater? We're able to stave off competition at the same time making sure that you are able to have enough employees to operate this I think I think for the experiences that I've had in the theater this year You could do it without a lot of employees and I hate to say that but it is become so streamlined from the point of purchasing Digitally to showing up watching the movie and then dip in yeah, well the company's just a debita is improving and beat estimates So that's helping matters as well kind of speaking to your point about maybe cutting some costs here The company said August and September were challenged by a dip in content availability That's come for not a lot of good movies out there I guess but anyway, so we're watching that all right. Let's take one last quick quick look at the markets before we leave you They are in the green up once again after cutting their leads now are almost at the highs of the session Coming up a kick of a Gita will continue our coverage of the October jobs report with ADP chief economist Mila Richardson Stay tuned have a great weekend everybody you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,67,2022-11-04 18:31:23
4880," Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11 a.m. on the East Coast. Say it out here in the West. I'm Akiko Fujita. Happy Friday to all of you. Here's what I'm watching this hour. Mixed signals in the labor market. The US has 261,000 jobs in October, blowing past expectations. But the unemployment rate ticks higher to 3.7%. Those hot numbers signaling the fed will continue to raise rates a little longer. Layoffs at Twitter, thousands of Twitter employees bracing for news this morning. They may be out of a job. It's all part of a new owner and CEO Elon Musk's plan to revamp the social media giant. We're going to have all the details for you coming up. And it is a big morning for DoorDash shares are surging after a big third quarter earnings beat. We're going to break down the numbers for you. But first let's look at the check of the markets. We are 90 minutes into the trading day. And take a look at how stocks are. Resonance responding to that strong with unexpected jobs report. The down now up more than 500 points. The S&P 500 up 60 in the Nasdaq up 150. All the major averages, those still on track to close out the week in the red. With the Nasdaq seeing the steepest losses up today. But it is down on the week. And despite what we're seeing today, the tech heavy index on pace for its more weekly losses January of this year. We are beginning this morning though with that all important jobs number. 261,000 jobs added to the U.S. economy as unemployment rose to 3.7% in October. Now, as we said, that's a bit of a mixed report coming just days ahead of the midterm elections. Where Democrats are struggling to convince voters. They can get the job done on the economy. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Rick Newman. It's interesting because we've been talking so much about these job numbers as in good news and not necessarily good news for the markets. Today the markets are up. But if you think about where President Biden has positioned himself, especially going into the midterms, is this good news for the Democrats? I can't tell, honestly. But let's start with the headline number. 261,000 new jobs. I mean, the strength in the job market is astonishing. Economists keep saying we expect the labor market to slow down. We expect job growth to slow down. And it keeps not slowing down. Now, we are not adding jobs at the pace we were doing right after the COVID downturn when suddenly every employer had to catch up. But in a normal economy, in a decently growing economy, if you had just 200,000 new jobs per month, that would be a terrific pace of growth. And we've had far more than that all year long. And the slow down just keeps not coming. And yet I'm looking at all these analyses today. And everybody's disappointed. Everybody was hoping that there would be clearer signs of a slowing job market. And why is that? Because everybody wants the Fed to stop raising interest rates. And in order to do that, the Fed needs to see signs that a recession is coming, that job gains are slowing, that wage gains are slowing. So, you know, it's great that we're adding all these new jobs. And it's unfortunate that everybody is disappointed about that. I mean, with that said, Rick, you know, what does this mean in terms of messaging in the final days leading up to the midterms? We've heard the president go out and say, look, the economy is still strong. But voters are looking at where inflation is and saying, yep, how do you look at both in contact? Biden cannot win on the, he cannot win this messaging battle. He has had a strong labor market to brag about all year long. And it hasn't worked. And it just tells you how pervasive inflation is. And it tells you how ruinous inflation is for family budgets. I mean, I just did some new analysis this week. And one of the ironies here is that even though inflation is improving, the rate of inflation has declined from a high of 9% down to, it's now 8.2%. People are actually saying, giving signs that they are getting more worried about inflation, not less worried. And I think for a couple of reasons. Number one, the longer it lasts, the longer people think it's going to last. So inflation expectations for the next six to 12 months are very high. People think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,68,2022-11-04 18:35:23
4881," And I think for a couple of reasons, number one, the longer it lasts, the longer people think it's going to last. So inflation expectations for the next six to 12 months are very high. People think price, these price hikes are going to stay. And I think another thing that's happening is the longer people have to deal with inflation, the more it streams their family budget. So we got the wage and number today, average hour learning, 4.7%, ordinarily, that would be great. But with inflation at 8.2%, your paycheck buys less. People are literally falling behind and the longer that goes on, the worse it is for the incumbent Democrats. So it looks like Biden and his fellow Democrats are going to lose at least one chamber of Congress next week. I think the only question is, are the polls accurate? If the polls are accurate, then it's going to be a bad night for Democrats. So if Democrats are hoping for anything at all at this point, it's at the polls are wrong. And really quickly, Rick, for the Republicans out of things, they've certainly seen strength in the economy, at least that they see that things, at least voters are not necessarily optimistic about where the economy is headed. That's positive for the Republicans. They look at the jobs number today. How do you think they spend this one? They are there. It's the same way they've been spitting it. They just keep pointing to inflation. And that's all they need to do. So I don't think you're going to hear any Democrats saying much, excuse me, Republicans saying much at all about the labor market. They're just going to keep saying Americans cannot afford the basics. And they're not wrong about that. Yeah, just hammering home the word inflation seems to be working for the Republicans so far. Rick Newman has always thanks so much for that. She agreed. For deeper insight, look on what the latest jobs data means for the Fed and the U.S. economy. Let's get right to ADP chief economist, Nila Richardson. Nila's Rick said, when you think about the tight labor market, that has really been one of the biggest hurdles for the Fed and its attempt to cool off the economy. What are the numbers today tell you about how much more the Fed needs to do to get it where they want it to be? Hi, great to be with you. Look, the Fed may not be able to go through the labor market to get to lower inflation. I think that's what the numbers tell us today. We're seeing really steady and robust job gains. The BLS report today was pretty broad base. Little different than what the ADP numbers showed earlier this week in terms of the broadness of the hiring, but in terms of the number of jobs created, we showed 239,000 private sector jobs. BLS, it was 230, so you're seeing the same kind of alignment when it comes to these monthly job gains. For the Fed, that means that it's not the labor market that's seeing weakness. It's things like housing and maybe stocks, but not the stock market today. So they have their work cut out for them. Yeah, it's been interesting to see the reaction and the past we've sourcing the strong jobs numbers kind of lead to declines in the broader market. What, you put this in context for us right now because you said, look, it's not necessarily the labor market that the Fed has to deal with. It's other areas like housing. Are there other levers that you think the central bank can be pulling when you consider that the rate hikes they've implemented so far haven't necessarily led to a significant cooling off of the labor market? The Fed has fundamentally won that that's rate hikes. Unfortunately, they can go faster, they can go slower, but they're still going to hike rates. I think what we are anticipating, at least I am, is that not just that they hike, but that they hike and they stay at an elevated federal funds rate where it's a period of time to bring back inflation. The bottom line is when you look at the labor market, when you look at consumer spending, this is a long game for the Fed. It is not a short game. And that means that rates are likely to stay higher for longer than was originally anticipated by the Fed. wage gain certainly something we've been keeping a watch on as we know so many companies have had to deal with the higher cost that have come with a very tight labor market. hourly earnings up 0.4% in October for the previous month. We are seeing a slight cooling down if you can call it that, but what are you hearing from employers who are saying, look, we can't necessarily fill the jobs, but maybe we don't necessarily have to dangle the same incentives we did six months ago. Well, 80 p pace 1 instance six workers in the United States. We have a lot of payroll data. When we look at pay growth, what we're saying is exactly what you see in this BLS report. So what were our food products?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,69,2022-11-04 18:39:52
4882," case one and since six workers in the United States. We have a lot of payroll data. When we look at pay growth, what we're seeing is exactly what you see in this BLS report. It's exactly what Powell pointed to in this press release that wage growth is slowing, but it's slowing to and stabilizing at an elevated level. It's still much higher than it was this time last year. So wages are not likely pushing up inflation, but it makes key inflation prolonged at the current level. And what we're hearing from our clients, especially our small business clients, is that it's still a tough time finding qualified workers, especially in consumer facing industries like restaurants, leisure and hotel accommodations. And so there's still a struggle here for the smaller firms who were out competed by larger firms earlier on in the recovery. Now is their chance to hire some of these larger firms take a pause. It's been a situation of good news, sometimes doing bad news in this report specifically. I guess the bad news that could be good news is that unemployment did tick a little higher. We're talking about 3.7%, which is still historically pretty low. I mean, how much higher do you think that number needs to go in order to see a real cooling up? Well, I focus on the real economy on the jobs market. So good jobs numbers are good news always. And I think the unemployment number, we have to put it in context. It's still below four percent. It's still at historical lows. That number is coming from the household survey, which is a little less reliable. That number, the 3.7% is likely going to take up back and forth over the next couple of months. But the punchline here is that we're still seeing job gains. And if you match that data to the initial jobless claims numbers that are still around pre-pandemic levels, we're not seeing a lot of firms starting to lay off in mass. And that's good news for Main Street. Main Street is the bulk of the economy. So that's good news for economic growth. Yeah, a lot of the layoff news largely focused on places like tech. We did here, but hiring freezes in places like Amazon as well as Lyft. But we'll continue to watch that. Neelette's good to have you on today. Neelah Richardson, ADP Chief Economist. And here to take a closer look at the market action falling to a stronger than expected jobs data. We've got Yahoo Finance's Jared Blicchery standing by. And Jared, this is a big pop that we're seeing on the back of a strong jobs number. Yes, we are. And it's somewhat reminiscent to me of that big pop we got after the last CPI report, which should have been bearish by all accounts because it was coming in pretty hot. But guess what? The market is reacting pretty strongly. S&P 500 up over 1.25%. And the Dow is really outperforming. Let me just put a five-day chart here and we can see the Dow is still down about 1.25% for the week. But it has come back to the mid-range of that five-day range. Nasdaq still hovering down below. And boy, it has been a story of two different markets here when you consider tech and the value trade that's more heavily represented by the S&P 500 in the Dow. So here's the S&P 500. We're just kind of chopping around down here. 3,900, excuse me, 3,900, which is right here, is a huge level. And also this breakdown region from the Fed the other day, 3,800, also going to be big as kind of where we stop today. But all in all, I think investors will take this, especially after the carnage that they suffered just a few days ago at the hands of Paul Enkel. By the way, today, materials in the forefront, that's a story about China potentially re-opening, along with consumer discretionary financials, energy staples, and industrials, nice mix to see there, Akiko. And finally, Jared, we're seeing a pretty broad-based gains today in the market. But want to hone in on the energy space here. Oil, seeing a big pop today. We got that news from G7 countries that they had agreed to how exactly this Russian oil price cap would be implemented. And what more can you tell us about how exactly this is likely this way in terms of where oil prices are likely to move? Sure. The thinking now is that it's going to be a fixed price limit instead of one that varies with the price of oil. The number that I've seen floating around is $60 per barrel. You can see WTI here, which trades pretty closely to Brent Crude. That's up 4% today. I think that's more on the reports that we're getting a possible re-opening of China based on—",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,70,2022-11-04 18:44:19
4883," pretty closely to Brent Crude. That's up 4% today. I think that's more on the reports that we're getting a possible reopening of China based on the fact that they may be rescinding the Zero COVID, or at least revising that policy here today, but there is that European, I guess, ban sanctions that go into effect on December 5th. So this is ahead of that. I don't think it's going to be a huge deal for the oil market. I think it's going to come down to the demand characteristics and especially with these marginal swings that we've seen with respect to China, maybe a few other places. But you look at the broad complex and commodity is say a lot of green, a lot of dark green, and guess what, we're also seeing the US dollar come down appreciably, particularly against the Renminbi over in China. Yeah, a lot of countries looking at that and saying there's some relief and slight potentially a Jared Vlickery. Thanks so much for that. Let's take a look at shares of Funko, failing to get the topics looking for after disappointing earnings. That stock is down. More than 50 percent. That's right. The company behind the collectible figurines reported earnings of $0.28 a share in revenue of $365.6 million. That was higher than the street expected, but weak guidance for the all-important holiday season spent shares plummeting. The company now expects holiday growth and profit to remain relatively flat from the same period last year that prompted JP Morgan to downgrade the stock from overweight to neutral, the firm slashing Funko's price target in half to $16 a share. Well, coming up on the other side Starbucks credits customers adding more stuff like Syrups to their coffee for its earnings beat. Yeah, that trend continue. We'll talk to an analyst after the short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,71,2022-11-04 18:48:37
4884," One investor is giving shares of Starbucks a big jolt in this session today. That stock is up nearly 10%. The coffee chain posted a record quarter attributing its success to rising prices, even despite some economic headlines. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Brooke Dupalma, who's all over the numbers for us. And Brooke, you know, the good news is domestically, there are consumers who are spending more per visit. But there's some headwinds over these. We'll get to that. But let's start on the domestics of the positive news first. Yeah, Kiko, what's positive news here is that although McDonald's, those Starbucks does not have a jingle like McDonald's Starbucks and Wall Street are certainly singing to the tune of this fiscal fourth quarter report Wall Street. Here today Starbucks having the best day since May shares up nearly 10% in two hours into trading day here. Now, as you noted here, despite them setting higher prices in Q3, they did give us a bit of an estimate there that they raised them a 5% over the past 12 months. But that actually did lead to higher revenue here, record $8.4 billion. Here in the US, seems to be sales jumped by 11%. Thanks to a 10% increase in average ticket price. But just how long will that momentum continue? And can customers expect another price hike? Starbucks, if a Rachel's Ariel, wait in this morning with Yahoo Finance. Really in response to inflationary pressures. We'll have some of that this year based on annualization from moves we made last year. But we expect our pricing to return to actions that are more on a historical level. What we focus on is really how do we sustain that ticket? Because it isn't just pricing. It's actually volume as well. We've seen our customers purchase more. That's evidence didn't you in a tax increase to tax. So we're seeing increased volume. Now some of those offerings of what they consider that are driving volumes include customization here about 60% of beverages are now customized. Modifiers have grown in double digits. And that's includes stuff like pumpkin spice syrup or pepper mocha. Serbs going into your coffee. But Rachel continued to emphasize is that the partners and as you noted, labor inflation certainly coming into consideration here driving this demand that Starbucks is willing to fill also Rachel emphasized that they continue to believe that aside by side relationship with partners is most important in this organization efforts continuum. Side note, Brooke, it looks like you and Rachel are wearing the same top. I didn't know yet. I don't have the same color. I was going to give her drink. They played were doing. We were talking about China because we did see a double digit decline in same source sales there. There's been some rumors floating around this week that potentially China could ease at zero. COVID policy. What more did we hear from Starbucks about what that's likely to mean for their second largest market? Yeah. Well, like so many US consumer brands, Starbucks is certainly hoping and weighing and ultimately, you know, super bullish on the fact that this COVID-19 zero policy will be lifted soon. Starbucks really taking a leader position here, ultimately weighing in and continuing to grow. Now there's nearly 6,000 stores opening up in China and Rachel emphasized that they're actually moving towards digital there in the midst of mobility, not being back to where it was pre pandemic. She said that 44% of the overall sales are digital now. And then once mobility lifts, they expect those stores to operate and continue to grow. Howard Schultz also see where opposite the key are he strongly believes that they will come out of this pandemic as the number one Western consumer brand. So certainly something that's keeping eye on and will continue to follow how exactly that performs on Wall Street. Yeah, certainly been a key market for Starbucks for a very long time. Brooke, thanks so much for that. Let's give the conversation going on Starbucks. We've got Sarah Senator, Bank of America, Senior Restaurant Analyst. Sarah, let me just start with your takeaways from the numbers that we got. A bit of a mixed result. I mean, positive things are moving in the right direction, but still some headwinds abroad. Yeah, I would say more positive than negative. So from the perspective of the US, you know, certainly one of the, if not the best, same store sales numbers, we've seen come out of the earnings season this quarter. The fact that they had 10 points of check is certainly a reflection on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,72,2022-11-04 18:52:44
4885," 10 points of check is certainly a reflection on, you know, as earlier we said, people adding food, people customizing, but also, you know, they said they did have positive transactions, which is a real rarity in this operating environment right now. So that combination was really, I think, very unique and a testament to how strong the brand is and the affinity that customers have, you know, outside of the US, very, very strong results with the exception of course of China, where we know lockdowns led to really intense mobility constraints. But even there, the same source sales were better than people had anticipated. So really recovering very nicely when some of these restrictions are lifted. And again, I think a reflection of how strong the brand is and the ability start of access to connect with consumers in that market and is well positioned as when the lockdown restrictions ultimately are lifted. You know, Starbucks are only not unique in raising some of their prices. We have seen so many food restaurants, you know, really try to make up for the additional costs they're having to pay for. But I wonder how much more pricing power you think Starbucks has? Well, I think you make a very good point there, which is that Starbucks is not unique. And in fact, Starbucks has actually taken less price or, you know, smaller price increases your rear than most in the industry. So if you look at the, you know, consumer price index for food away from home, which is restaurants, you see that that's up, you know, eight, nine percent. I think about seven and a half, eight percent year to date more recently. If you look at some of the other restaurants in the industry who have reported six, five, six percent, which is what Starbucks says on their menu, it was actually very low end of the range. So typically we're hearing prices more in the eight percent range McDonald's to 10 to put laid took about 11 and a half on their menu. So to have six percent price increase year-to-year really is exceptional, but only in the sense that it's lower than what you're seeing at most other restaurants. And finally, Sarah, I want to get back to the point you made about China. I mean, certainly the expectation seems to be that if there is some softening on a zero COVID policy activity, pick up people go back into stores, you know, these are all positives, especially for retailers like Starbucks, but we're also looking at some significant downturn in terms of the economy, in terms of the broader growth that we're seeing unemployment higher in the second largest market there. I mean, what's a realistic expectation about how much Starbucks can return to to what extent Starbucks can return to pre pandemic levels in China? Well, I think, you know, a couple things one is just in terms of thinking about the pace of growth that Starbucks has in China, big part of it has been new unit growth. So same store sales will certainly prior to COVID were healthy in that kind of three to four percent range, but really the big driver of growth and a value creation for Starbucks and for Chinese consumers has been opening of new restaurants. So, you know, the expectations that they can continue to do that at a low double digit pace, certainly if you look at the store base, you know, it's roughly 6,000 that compares to the US of over 14 or 15,000. So, you know, think about the relative size of the population. It certainly would seem to suggest that they're targeted about 9,000 stores in China's eminently achievable. So, I don't see reason to think that that universe has to slow. To your point, you know, Starbucks is very cognizant of the economic pressures facing the country, but I think, you know, what they have done so well in the last few years is really adapt their loyalty program and make sure that they can really speak directly to customers one to one, which I think is very important at all times, but certainly as consumers are thinking about their budget, as they're thinking about where they want to spend their discretionary dollars. Sarah Seneswar, Bank of America, Senior Restaurants Analysts, it's good to talk to you today, really appreciate the time. Well, coming up thousands of Twitter employees to be losing their jobs today, I'm already a lawsuit in the works on the back of that. We're going to tell you about it after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,73,2022-11-04 18:57:03

4887," time as we enter the final down up just under 200 po buying action over the last or so to you look at the s positive territory still you can see well off its just around 7 tens of a at the nasak 100 that is for the day at least on look at some of the other let's take a look on a w basis here nasak for the ready to concede off just as door dash comes up let the major averages here the week in the red and the Dow and the SMP you around 2% over the past also in the red off just as well taking a look at that we're seeing play on an intraday basis you financials as the leaders the only sector trading on a five day basis the leader there up just a look at some of the we mentioned the fact taking a sharp hit on s services and technology in the market today and inside the Dow a bit of past five days but on int looking at Microsoft hold Morgan in the green honey pushing to the upside to the market and we're trying to hold on to that good news you can call it in the jobs report the market is looking at it as good news at 3.7% unemployment rate which was a bit higher than what we got in the last reading the markets a bit encouraged by that is the sign that maybe potentially the Fed will not be as hawkish as they have been anticipating sets the big driver in today's markets for sure. All right but I also want to get you up to speed on what is happening with oil and China will connect those dots for you just a second of the day. I'm going to take a look at what we're seeing with WTI and crude receiving that it's up more than 5% here that's rallying to a three week high also Brent crude there up about four and a third of a percent now we've got a few factors of play we have G7 countries agreeing on a price capping mechanism on Russian crude you also have the US dollar losing some strength on use on some news that on that news and also China the world's biggest crude import to reportedly planning to scrap a policy that's penalizing airlines based on co-vid cases brought into the country and of course any rumor or sign of a potential easing of China's zero-covid policy that's also trickling over to China's ADR so we're going to hop over this we can see how the Chinese stocks are doing today and as we can see here you have some of the bigger players you have bar by here rallying more than five and a half percent you have been world are there up more than nine percent JD dot com there up almost nine percent as well and we're also seeing the EVs look at neo they're up more than 15 percent on the day and we also have the auto that's up more than 7 percent on the day and trip.com as you can see over here up more than 5 percent on the day as well. All right well the top story for markets today as China was just discussing the jobs report and the labor market showing signs of resiliency but there could be some concerns on the horizon. How employers adding 261,000 jobs last month thousands more than expected and employment rising slightly to 3.7 percent when Michelle Gerard had a US net West global economics joins us now to break down those numbers so obviously this is just one of the metrics that the Fed watches what are your big takeaways from this job state. I think stepping back even with the next messages you have to conclude that the labor market is holding up pretty well in the face of what has been I think aggressive action from the Federal Reserve to date I think it suggests that the Fed has more to do with the federal government. The Fed has been signaling that since on Wednesday the Fed has signaled that alongside the 75 basis point rate increase that rates were going to continue to rise they might rise slower going forward but that the Fed was believing that interest rates were ultimately that it had higher than they had thought maybe even a month ago. So I think this is this report is consistent with the Fed thinking that it's too early to think about in the Rehijk cycle. Michelle, it certainly does seem like that but it's interesting when you take a look 10 numbers about the cert你說 5 but it's about Welding mayor. flakes 10",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,75,2022-11-04 19:06:15
4888," the feds thinking that it's too early to think about a stop in the rate high cycle. Michelle certainly does seem like that but it's interesting when you take a look at the markets reaction we were up almost 600 points at the highs of the session of course we're pretty far off those highs but when you take a look I guess at any signs of weakness you mentioned the unemployment rate 3.7% just what is that signal to you I guess maybe is potentially the labor market finally slowing down. Well there may be some hands as you said the unemployment rate moved higher and moved up as employment as measured by the household survey actually declined so when the Bureau of Labor Services calls households and asked them if they're working as opposed to looking at what employers say they found actually far fewer people working than than the month before and you know maybe that's a sign of some of some easing although that number is so volatile month to month you know I think when you look at the hourly earnings number you know that number came down on a year-over your basis maybe that has speak there's some other signs that perhaps wage pressures are beginning to ease ever so slightly. To me that is really something that would be such a welcome development for the fed to see if there is some cooling on wage pressures then I think that would begin to begin to get the fed to feel a bit more comfortable or confident that in fact as we look ahead to 2023 inflation can indeed begin to move sustainably lower. And Michelle what about the quality of jobs that are still on the table because that seems to be an issue some of these lower-paid jobs still a lot of openings obviously they were the hardest hit during the peak of the pandemic. You were still seeing a very high number of job openings now I will say in this month's report the job gains were fairly broad-based and you did give a big gain in manufacturing which tends to be higher paid but you also as always saw a big increase in service employment up to 100,000 and you know and there you did see kind of some split in terms of some of the lower wage categories but it was it was a bit evenly more dispersed. The truth is a lot of the demand for labor in those lower paid industries it's just still very difficult to find workers as you said those sectors were hard hit during the pandemic a lot of individuals left those jobs and they they've gone out they've upscaled themselves they've educated themselves they're not looking to go back to those lower earning wages and as a result you're seeing still a real difficulty I think for employers to define and actually hire those workers of workers into those jobs. So Michelle going back to what you were saying just a few minutes ago about what the signals for the Fed you basically were saying that it kind of reinforces the current path of rate hikes that the Fed had been on but when it comes to that next meeting and there's a number of data points I know between now and the December meeting but what do you think is most likely on the table could we get another 75 basis point hike. We could but as you said there are a couple of very important inflation reports that that will be due out our feeling is the inflation numbers may show ever so slightly some pooling and that combined with the fact that Fed has already done a great deal we think they will come down on the side of moving a bit more slowly so we expect a 50 basis point hike but I think importantly whereas many perhaps had thought that would be it and the Fed would cause in 2023 we had all long thought we'd still see a couple of additional smaller rate hikes in the first half of next year and I think the comments and the data the policy has gotten from the Fed and the data suggests that that the rate hiking cycle is indeed likely still over so we may get 50 basis points in December but again a couple of further fractions in the first half of 2023. And Michelle what are you watching outside of what the Fed can do obviously we've heard a lot about hiring freezes and layoffs but we still see this very strong job market what is the fact as outside of the Fed's control that you're watching well I mean in general I think you know for the Fed there's the question is just what you know how how much will these slow down in economic",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,76,2022-11-04 19:10:10
4889," Well, I mean, in general, I think, you know, for the Fed, there's the question is just what, you know, how, how much will the slowdown and economic activity actually bring inflation lower? So, you know, I think that is the, that's the question. We may see weak economic data. We may see the demand for labor, fall. We may see job openings begin to pull back. It's not quite evident yet. But even if the economy slows, we've got to see some evidence that that will transmit into lower inflation. And I think that that will happen. And so I'm just watching for signs ultimately, the, the turn in terms of the market, the turn for the Federal Reserve being able to fall up peak in the rate hiking cycle, it all, all roads lead back to when does inflation peak and begin to move sustainably lower. And so keeping an eye on all of that, and I think you've got to look at more than just the, you know, how strong the economy or weak the economy is because that may not be back into, you know, we could go with may not be back into lower inflation. I think keeping an eye on any signs of inflation or wage pressures moving lower is ultimately going to be the key for market and for their and, and for Fed action. All right. Well, we do thank you for joining us, Michelle Gerard. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Thank you. This afternoon. All right. Well, we're just getting started here when you're finally it's live coming up. Elon Musk says Twitter is facing a quote, massive drop in revenue. Who he's blaming.

4890," Elon Musk says Twitter is suffering from a, quote, massive drop in revenue. Now, the finance says Dan Howley joins us now with the details. So Dan, was this expected? It kind of isn't just the way, you know, that the tweet was kind of unexpected, but the moves that we've seen kind of were expected. So the main tweet that Elon sent out is Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups, pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation, and we did everything we could to appease the activists. Extremely messed up, they're trying to destroy free speech in America. Now, I mean, it's free speech for a company to decide whether it wants to advertise with Twitter or not. So, you know, it cuts both ways. But what he's referring to is the number of companies that are stepping back, pausing, or at least putting on hold their advertising campaigns on Twitter. That includes the likes of GM, General Mills, Pfizer, Volkswagen. We had Mondalees also putting their advertising campaigns on hold. And really what this comes down to is just the fact that they're not entirely sure what's going to happen at Twitter. Elon Musk has gutted the C-suite, gotten rid of the board, fired numerous employees today, and you know, we're still not exactly certain what he's going to be doing with Twitter. Now, he has released previous statements saying that he doesn't want the company to turn into a essentially lawless hellscape. He has said that he wants it to be warm and welcoming, and that they will work with advertisers. They also spoke to members of civil rights groups who were concerned about the potential for a hate speech to take over on Twitter because Elon Musk has said that he wants to see fewer or relaxed moderation there. And so I think what's going on here is these companies are essentially saying, look, we're just hedging our bets on whether or not Twitter is going to be a good place for our products to be displayed as parts of ads. They don't necessarily want things like Oreos showing up next to some kind of insane tirade. So it makes sense for these companies, and Elon Musk is obviously bothered by that. And so he's saying that it's essentially some kind of larger activist campaign when it could simply be companies doing their due diligence. It is certainly a challenging time here for Twitter. You could also say that about the broader tech space. I also want to talk to you though about what we're seeing play out in gaming because it's an industry that's clearly been under pressure just this week, EA lowering its expectations in terms of guidance. Part of that due to the slowdown that we've seen in gaming. Is that going to turn around any time soon? Yeah, it's unlikely. The holiday season is generally the best time for gaming sales. And you know, you might expect that it would be able to raise the prospects for gaming this year just based on the fact that that's when so many people go out and buy. But it's been hit so much from the drops that we've seen due to the comparisons to the pandemic era that it's unlikely that we're going to see those shoot up anytime soon. There's also just a lack of high quality titles that are expected for the holidays or that are coming out for the holidays. There's two standouts right now or three standouts. There's God of War, Ragnarok and the Clistol Protocol. Those are still coming. We did see Call of Duty come out. We had FIFA come out, both of those games, FIFA and Call of Duty had huge numbers of players so there is an appetite there for games. It's just that there aren't enough for people to get excited about and purchase. All right, Dan Halle. Thanks. As always, of course, we will keep tracking that. We'll talk a little bit more about gaming here in just a few minutes. But first, let's take a look at the broader tech space because tech stocks have taken a beating in recent weeks amid an advertising slump and higher rates. And a number of those companies in the sector announcing layoffs and hiring freezes. So here to discuss all of that as well as what lies ahead for the tech media industry. We want to bring in Michael Wolfe, activate consulting founder and CEO. Michael, it's great to have you here. So let's take a step back and talk about some of the ad trends that we're seeing play out in the sector. We're just talking to Dan about what's going on specifically at Twitter. And that's a bit of a different story. The more we're seeing play out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,78,2022-11-04 19:18:54
4891," Let's take a step back and talk about some of the ad trends that we're seeing play out in the sector. We're just talking to Dan about what's going on specifically at Twitter and that's a bit of a different story. The more we're seeing play out in some of the other names in this space. We heard from meta, alphabet, snap, all suffering from a slowdown in advertising spending. What you're take away from what we're seeing there. Advertisers are looking for a couple of things. One is they're looking for performance. Are they going to get sales? The second thing they're looking for is momentum. Is there going to be more consumer revenue? The third is they're looking for safety, which is this is the issue with Twitter. Some of it is and a lot of these the performance is going down and so Facebook is less effective and so you can see and others. Google the cost of the keywords is going up. Performance is not great. Momentum, if you look at some of the major sites, their engagement is going down and so it's not as if the overall sector and part of what's also driving these big layoffs is there's that online never let a good crisis go to waste. All of these companies have got been bloated lots of staff that they need and this is a good excuse for them to lower the number of staff members. You'll notice they're not selling engine. They're not they're not firing engineers and they're not firing developers because those are the people that they need the most. Michael, this is Rochelle here. In terms of where they're placing these ads, we saw that when Netflix announced that it was having its tiered model, we saw a lot of advertisers pouring into that. Is that where you see more of the future of this going more towards the streaming space? The streaming space it's going to be there's no doubt there's going to be a lot of growth and advertising. The streaming services when you put ads there it's it's really in a lot of ways it's a good substitute for TV. It has some limitations. It's not going to just be Netflix and it's going to be all of the different streaming services are going to launch an ad tier. If you look at peacock that's from NBC Universal that's already gaining a lot of advertising. So obviously video advertising is the most important for selling a lot of things and I think that that's going to continue to grow. Michael, when you take a look at some of the other trends outside of advertising, we've seen Meta really suffer because they haven't been able to sell this whole Metaverse movement to the masses or at least to Wall Street. You can obviously if you take a look at the performance of the stock year today. Is that more of a meta specific story? And what do you think is maybe the bigger story going on with the Metaverse here? It's first of all the term Metaverse is one that now is cringeworthy but and it's been a massive hype cycle but there's a number of reasons why this is real. One of the mis you have 300 million people that are ready in what are Metaverse environments between Roblox Minecraft Fortnite. You have people who are living in these virtual worlds and they're doing a lot of the things that are important for them to be in a metaverse. In terms of Meta, well a lot the entire bet is on headsets and it's on VR and we don't believe our firm activate we don't necessarily believe that this is going to be VR. Most people can't be in VR for more than about a half an hour and all of those games they're 2D experiences today so it really comes down to a 1500 dollar headset is very expensive for most consumers to pay. And Michael I want to ask you since you're talking about a gaming the global video gaming market. Now you expect it to grow to nearly 222 billion by 2026. Talk about what are going to be the real growth drivers there and where you see that as you mentioned things like like VR on the Metaverse as well. Well one of the growth drivers is this is a hit driven business and so we're going to continue to see franchises, established franchises, releasing new games. That's one of the things. I think also we're going to see a lot more gamers. Gaming has been very attractive for women. You see a lot of different groups of people coming in. You also see it isn't just mobile games. You see a lot more people having access to high speed internet so those games are wired and they're and they're already multiplayer games. So it's an activity that's going to continue to grow and it's just taking a bigger piece of people's entertainment and technology time. And Michael we've already seen some consolidation within the gaming industry but do you think we'll likely see more in the years ahead? We think that there's going to be more consolidation. In fact what we believe is all of the major technology companies are going",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,79,2022-11-04 19:23:11
4892," likely see more in the years ahead? We think that there's going to be more consolidation. In fact, what we believe is all of the major technology companies are going to end up buying the game companies. And we saw this begin this year with Microsoft Buying Activision. But if they're all going to be in the gaming business, if they're all going to be moving towards interactive worlds like Metaverse, they're going to need to own gaming companies. And if you look at the value of most of the gaming companies, they're worth about a day's volatility in most of these other stocks. So it's obvious to us that this is where it's going to go. And the ones that are most attractive within that space, I guess, how are you trying to parse through and identify the winners or losers? Because what we just heard from Dan is that I guess they don't all stock up as even at this point. Well, they're not even the, it's the franchises that matter. And so they need to decide, usually, yes, the last quarter of the years where there's a lot of activity. And let's be clear, part of this is driven by just releases of game titles. And so it comes down to when each company is going to release a game title. When they release a new title, it's unbelievable. I mean, you had the last red dead redemption. It was released. It was almost $1 billion in the first weekend. So this will come down to when they release and what they release. And Michael, I know, obviously, Twitter gets a lot of headlines at the moment when it comes to social media. But obviously, when you talk social media, you have to talk about TikTok. A lot of growth, still a lot of growth potential here. But obviously, US regulators really starting to crack down on TikTok as well. How do you see social media use growing? And what do you see as the biggest headwinds for the industry? TikTok is a disruptive force, not just in social media, but across all technology and media. So if you look at the amount of time that the average TikTok user is based on our research, in some cases, it's over an hour a day. It's becoming a good alternative to search. There are a lot of people who are, when they go to a search, then instead of going to Google, they're going to TikTok. And of course, media is replacing a lot of the longer forms of video. It's hard, given the popularity of this, it's a huge mistake for the government to try to regulate it. What ends up happening is when you don't allow people to have a legitimate reason to access something in technology and media, they find it a illicit way of doing it. So it'll be a huge mistake, and it's hard to enforce. It's certainly be interesting to watch out all plays out. Michael, if you're great to have, you think so much to join us in studio. Great to be here. Coming up, investors, don't see drop kings as a winning bet at least today. Shares plunging. Look at that. Just around 27%. Find out why when we come back.Look at just so much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,80,2022-11-04 19:27:45
4893," in It's time for Triple Play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We have Atlassian, draft kings, Adidas, or Adidas. For that we'll have Jeravlick rejoining us. I'll start with my pick, which is Atlassian Corporation, Tick a Team, TEAM, TEAM. The stock in the software design and project management hosting company plunged into two year lows. You can see that down about 30% on the day after reporting fiscal 1st quarter 2023 financial results. 7 years of 807 million was a touch higher than expected, a profit of an adjusted basis of 36 cents a share. That felt slightly short, but it was the slowdown in the conversion of free users to paid plans becoming more pronounced that investors really seemed to hone in on. Now existing paid users are also slowing as companies as we've been reporting a tightening their purse strings in this current macroeconomic environment. That followed a raft of price cuts, including from Mitsuho, $255 a share from 320, from Baird, 210 a share from 380 from Goldman Sachs, 265 a share from 300. So obviously a sharp reaction there and the stock continuing to be under pressure this afternoon. And Michelle, I actually got downgraded by McQuerry, downgraded to neutral. They cut their purse target to 147 from 287. So so higher from where it is today, but you can really show just by those revisions how bearish Wall Street is getting on this day. We can take a look at today's drop. It's just off the lows of the day, but we could be looking at the worst day on record for this stock. We do see losses of just over 30%. But certainly a very uncertain and tough macroeconomic environment. We're seeing that effect the name there. My pick today is draft King shares plunging after its latest earnings report showing that sports betting a user growth has slowed the company posted a 22% gain in users, but that was down from 30% in the prior quarter. And the draft King's is under pressure from Wall Street to become a profitable, which is CEO Jason Robbins says that he still thinks is possible by the fourth quarter of next year on the earnings call. Robbins also discussed spending and a shift from local to national ads as the company expands in more states. Jared, we've seen more and more states legalized sports betting yet we haven't really seen that reflected in draft King's stock. We're looking at massive losses today. And for the year, this stock really has been under pressure. Mike, we were just talking the break shone that any time it seems like every day we have a handful of stocks, which are just plummeting. Let's pull up the Wi-Fi interactive and I can show you we are now back down to what was support in the earlier part of the year. This is a year-to-day chart, down 58%. But let me show you a max chart because as we are all discussing, this was a spack way back in the day. It came to market at $10 a share and guess what? It is almost at right back at that price here. It's another one of those pandemic, I guess, source sports right now. So let's get back to the main point here because I am looking at something that is up today and this is the European Sports Apparel Juggernaut Adidas, up about 25% and having some of its best day since 2005. And this is on the news that it's in talk with the outgoing Puma CEO, Bjorn Gouldin, to take over from current CEO, Casper Vorsted. Now, Gouldin is leaving Puma at the end of the year already amid record profits and sales. Yet the stocks of both Adidas and Puma, numbers 2 and 3 in the athletic sector, are both considerably down this year. Though Adidas is off a bit more, perhaps due to its controversial relationship with Yay, which it recently terminated. Now, I want to go back to the Wi-Fi Interactive and just show you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,81,2022-11-04 19:32:02
4894," This year, though, a deed is off a bit more, perhaps due to its controversial relationship with Yeh, which it recently terminated. Now, I want to go back to the Wi-Fi interactive and just show you a comparison chart. This is a deed as versus Puma. I said they were neck and neck, both down about 60% on the year. Although if you take a look at the last three years, it is favoring Puma a bit there, Shana. Yeah, it certainly is. When you take a look at a deed as the company needed to do something to turn things around at least, that was the message that we're getting from Wall Street. Adidas had really been under fire most recently because of the partnership with Kanye. So it'll be interesting to see how this new CEO approaches maybe future partnerships like this here, Rochelle. Yeah, we know that Adidas also teamed up with British Rapper Stormsie. Hopefully that will end a little bit better than the collaboration with Kanye for sure. Yeah, it's certainly Wall Street. Pretty excited about this move today. Coming up, Dr. Fauci, saying that the US is at a pandemic crossroads. Find out what's concerning the White House of Chief and Medical Advisor most as we approach the Winter Month's next. Thank you. It's been buying things. It's been a wild day for the markets on the heels of the October jobs report. You can see gains across the board down now up 312 points was up just around 600 points at the highs of the session. Also holding on to gains as well as a NASDAQ investors encouraged by the uptick that we saw in the unemployment report. So we need to talk about how the equity market is looking at this and what this convene for the last couple of months of the year. We want to bring in Julian and Manuel Everkore, ISI, Senior Managing Director and Julian. It's great to see you. So I guess just your takeaway from the jobs report and kind of the wild action that we've seen play out in the market today. It's a really extraordinary day in every respect.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,82,2022-11-04 19:36:27
4895," So I guess just your takeaway from the jobs report and kind of the wild action that we've seen play out in the market today. Really an extraordinary day in every respect. And I think that if you had asked most investors how the market would react, given today's numbers, they would have said a strong rally would have been last on their list of outcomes. For us, this is a process. It's not that the market's getting comfortable with where the Fed needs to go. That's going to be difficult to play out. But what we've really seen was a geopolitical boost here that is helping to turn sentiment. And we think kick off the next leg of this bear market rally. The news out of China really quite good that they're going to advance the dialogue. At some point over the weekend towards the zero COVID eventual reopening. And then she's comment about not wanting to see any sort of nuclear weaponry used in Europe really, really helps at the margin to do some de-risking to the European situation. Very positive. Yeah, so Julie, when you take a look at that, the fact that you see that this could potentially be the next leg of the bear market rally. How high do you think we could potentially hit? So basically when we've done a lot of work on what bear market rallies tend to look like. Now the starting point for this one at the trough on October 13 was down 27.5%. When you get a bear market rally starting from that deep a selloff, the average tends to be up around 17.5% from that level. So this rally could carry all the way to 4,000, but there's another added aspect to it. Is that the seasonality, not only the fourth quarter, but the tendency for stocks to do well after the midterms and into the following year is very, very strong. So then, Julie, in terms of the minds that you should have, if you have a shorter investing time horizon versus a longer one, how should you be approaching the markets right now? Well, if you have a shorter time horizon, you really, really need to trade smaller positions, give them a lot more leeway. And from our point of view, this is a situation where you want to be selective buyers of value type stocks. We've seen a lot of pain in the growth space over the last couple weeks. The earnings season has not been kind in general to fang, but value stocks in a high inflation environment and a high interest rate environment tend to do well. They've outperformed this year. We think that continues to be the trend. And as you look at the rest of the earnings season, what are some of the bell weather companies that you're going to be keeping on that will really give you a gauge of how you think the economy is fairing or at least how investors think the economy is fairing? Right. We really seen the majority of reports. And this is one of these seasons, not unlike the season in July, where you don't really want to say this stock means this to the economy. Because frankly, the story from an economy wide perspective has been extremely complex. What is interesting and notable for us, though, when you think about the regression of this earnings season is that we got the downgrades to earnings expectations that we thought we would get. In fact, bottoms up consensus is still about six to seven percent above where our next year estimate is. But recently the last several days, those earnings downgrades have started to flatten out. And that alone, regardless of the kind of commentary you're here, you'll hear in the last couple of weeks from the tag ends of reports is likely to support equities. All right. We're always great to get your insights. Evercore, ISI, Senior Managing Director, Julian Immanuel. Thank you so much for joining us. Have a great week. Thank you. All right. Coming up, a storm is brewing in the cloud. First, it was Microsoft and Amazon and concerns now rocking shares of Twilio losing a third of their value today. The company COO joins us next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,83,2022-11-04 19:40:26
4896," And concerns now rockenshers of Twilio, losing a third of their value today. The company COO joins us next. Shares of Twilio plummeting after the communications software maker issued fourth quarter revenue guidance below estimates and posted a loss of 27 cents per share during the third quarter. The company had more than 280,000 active customer accounts at the end of Q3 up 5,000 from the previous quarter. We joined by a Cozema Shipchannel at Twilio's COO. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. As we're seeing the stock really under pressure today, what do you think investors are perhaps not getting about this whole picture? Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me. It certainly is a little bit of a humbling day with respect to the stock price. But I think look, the financial framework for the company going forward is actually quite good. It's a tough macro backdrop. No question about that. But as we look at our financial results, we put up a really strong Q3 in a tough macroeconomic environment. We did take down some of our guidance for Q4 and provided a medium term range on the revenue side that was 15 to 25 percent up over the next three to five years. That's how we kind of defined it. And we committed to being a profitable company over that time frame as well. So I certainly understand that there are some macro dynamics here and potentially some dynamics that investors are playing in a wait and see fashion. But we feel really good about the setup of the company and feel really good about the products and customers that we've got. Cozema, when you take a look at the performance in this stock today, obviously Wall Street a little bit concerned about some of the macro headwinds not only facing Twilio, but more so this sector at large, are you seeing, I guess, any delayed purchase decisions or longer sales cycles as a result? And you potentially seeing those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,84,2022-11-04 19:45:04
4897," It's making the rise of businesses are becoming a big win in the early year. I think it's really wild and thick, but this sector at large are you seeing any delayed purchase decisions or long sales so as a result and you potentially see those had. Where's here over the next quarter or two? –I guess it's hard to imagine them getting too much worse but we are definitely seeing some sector impacts, not surprisingly. we're seeing things So I think those are all sectors in which we've seen some impacts across the board. I can imagine that you'll see some additional reports come out from various companies, particularly around CPG and retail over the coming months. But we think we've largely baked that stuff in into our guidance. And so we feel pretty good about the setup of our company. And again, I think we feel like we're going to be profitable irrespective of the environment. And we think it's a good setup for investors going forward, in spite of the correction that occurred today. And in Bank of America's note, I mean, they were complementary about the analyst state that they had presenting it as an opportunity to reset expectations and talking about the shift in focus from growth to delivering meaningful operating profits. What is the strategy there? Well, we always want to be a growth company, right? I mean, we were a technology company. We're of such a vintage that we think we can continue delivering high growth rates for a long period of time. And at our scale, we're growing 15 to 25% as about a $4 billion company, which I think is quite impressive. That said, I think we should also reap the economies of scale that come with being a large company. We don't just want to be a big company. We want to be a really great company. And I think part of that is being really profitable. So we committed to being profitable in 2023 on a non-gap basis. We will accomplish that. And then thereafter, we also committed to ongoing op-margin accretion, which we have good plans to deliver. We'll generate leverage across most of our cost categories. And I think our software products will really start picking up as well. And we've got some really exciting stuff in the pipeline between Flex, our contact center product, and then segment and engage on the data side. And speaking of costs there, you're coming in announcing layoffs, 11% of the workers back in September. When you look ahead here, do you see the need to potentially, I guess, insert some more cost-cutting measures as you do remain focused on profitability next year? Yeah, I don't see that today. I think that it's a fair question. But based on the plan that we put together, we came up with a variety of scenarios that we could imagine, some of which are relatively dire, in fact. And so we feel pretty good about what we did. I think we'd been thinking about right sizing the workforce for a while. I think we got a little bit ahead of ourselves in terms of what happened during COVID, vis-a-vis hiring. It's unfortunate, really difficult decision, obviously. But I think it was appropriate and the right thing for us to do to set up the long term of the company. Going forward, I wouldn't take anything off the table ever, obviously. But we feel pretty good about the setup right now, and I don't see us having to do anything further currently. And some of the key partners of Twilio that Bank of America survey talked about the competitive pricing pressure that might intensify, intensify, because Twilio does have a premium pricing on it. Are there any plans to perhaps adjust pricing given what the competition is doing and given the macroeconomic background? No, not right now. I mean, honestly, we feel pretty good about the competitive dynamic. We feel pretty good about the way that we're priced. We do feel like we offer a premium technology offering. And yeah, there's a higher price that goes with that, but I think it's also a better product. And we have different products and different competitive sets based on the way that those things shake out. We're different in data, we're different in marketing, we're different in context center. And then again, a little bit different competitive set in communications. But in each of those, we command a price premium. We feel like we deserve that, and we feel like the technology is superior to the competitors. Well, Kuzama, we really appreciate you coming on today, especially given that such a tough day when you take a look at the stock price off just around 35% we hope to have you back. Kuzama, Ship Chandler, Twilio's COO. Great. Thanks for having me.

4898," ED are briefing that the flu and respiratory viruses are hitting much harder and earlier than in the past. Angelique Imlani joins us now with more on this. And I guess Andriv already, I guess, heard the warnings that hospitals are beginning to overfill, but what else could we potentially see now over the next couple of months? Well, we're definitely potentially going to be seeing COVID still. That's still on the horizon and plays into that threat of the triple-demic, tri-demic, you know, triple threat, whatever you want to call it. We know that Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, was talking about this in a radio interview recently and stressing the fact that the country is not really at a good place when it comes to finding the virus. We're still at more than 400 deaths per day. We're still in the thousands and tens of thousands of cases per day. And that is still leading the world, so not a good place at all. And with winter variants or new variants on the horizon, that is potentially going to be a fair worse. We know that we've been following the BQ-1, BQ-1, one variants. And they now combined makeup 35 percent. That's an increase from the last time we discussed this. It was 27 percent before the CDC now saying it accounts for 35 percent of cases. But now looking at RSV and flu, that is already stressing really the East Coast right now, the Minutelanic, New England, Washington area, currently experiencing significant capacity strains according to the CDC. And they're expecting that this will move through in waves, hitting other parts of the U.S. similar to the way that COVID did in the past years. Now, what's important about noting the RSV and flu early season, it's really an early and strong season for both in flu specifically, the highest level of hospitalizations that they've seen at this point in time in the year in over a decade. So that's where some of the concern is coming from. And clear whether or not it will be a quick rise and plateau or if it will be a sustained surge of cases around the country, that's something that the CDC officials were unable to really pin down. But that's sort of where things stand. And we heard from specifically CDC's Dr. Jose Romero saying that previous years, eight-typical seasons due to mitigation against COVID left a large swath of the U.S. population and uninfected, so children need to be infected and essentially to get passed in now. And the masking that was taking place before helped to keep all this at bay in the past few years. And, Angela, understand that Pfizer's released some new data on Omicron boosters. What can you tell us about that? That's right. As anticipated, we know that their updated booster by valent booster has been effective and is supposed to be more effective. And in fact, then the initial strain, which is why administration officials have stopped offering the original vaccine and are pushing the updated by valent booster, a new data out today, saying that it was four times more effective for older individuals, which is really the target of this new shot. So after a month, they're seeing a really good protection levels as anticipated. Sorry, I'm going to be some encouraging news area. Angela Kimlani, thanks so much. We're coming up returning a purchase or a gift that you don't need may become more costly. Find out why next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,86,2022-11-04 19:53:42
4899," How to würde choose Shoppers beware retailers are rethinking their return policies ahead of the holiday shopping season. More businesses can't seem to afford these returns, adding a significant burden to retailers' storage challenge. So what do you think, Sean? How much do you think this is going to discourage consumers from returning to stores? Because I know the free shipping button is something, but knowing that I might have an issue with returns, especially for the holidays, that's asking a lot, I think. Yeah, I think it's huge. I was actually a recent survey out showing that consumers, 98% consumers, say that free shipping is the most important consideration when they're buying online, and that also goes for free returns as well. So I think so many people are used to what's happened over the last two and a half years during the pandemic. They've been able to extend that return window or have been able to return their online purchases for free. So I think this could potentially really impact sales at specific stores. We've already seen a number of stores short in their return window gap. O'Neary, Jay, crew are among them now. There are a little bit of different rules as we lead up to the holiday shopping season. We certainly have seen retailers become a little bit more lenient over the next two or three months. But the fees, I think, to return items. I know Anthropology, LLB, cost about $6 return item. And I think that that is enough to maybe, I guess, discourage some people from buying from those stores. That's true, because I mean, when you think of Nordstrom, one of the things that they're known for is having this obviously very flexible return policy, and they haven't waived on that even during the pandemic. But I think when at a time when people have less discretionary income and it takes that much little to sort of put you off, if you know you might end up paying a fee, not just for something you bought for yourself, but potentially for one of, you know, for someone you're giving a gift to, for me, that's going to make me think twice and definitely read the small print before I hit buy on the button for sure. Alright, we'll leave that there, but coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street, stick with us here on your finance life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,87,2022-11-04 19:58:10
4900," o Just about 90 seconds to go until the closing bell still looking at gains across the board in adjusting performance how did And some of the rate sensitive stocks, the I growth names, those have gotten hit this week. On the sector action on a daily chart, you'll see materials, financials, technology, leading. But a five day chart shows you communication services technology, consumer discretionary. Those were the losers for the week. And keeping it on that five day chart, you can see the NASDAQ 100, Apple down 11% over the last five days, Amazon down 12%. Here's the closing bell for today, Friday, November 4th. MUSIC And now you have it ending this first week of November in the green to the major indices. Let's take a deeper dive here. We see the down there up about 400 points there, though pairing back some of the gains of the day, the S&P 500 there, of about 50 points there, one and a third of a percent of the tech of the NASDAQ, up about one and a third of a percent. They're all three up for the day, but down for the week. Well, let's take a closer look at the broader markets. Let's bring in our market panel. We have Sean O'Hara, president of PASA ETFs, and Harley Vassman, simplifies managing partner. Welcome to you both. So, Harley, I first want to start with you. How would you characterize the action that we're seeing in the market to end the week? You know, all we're trying to do is basically process the Fed, process inflation, process interest rates. They've kind of told us what's going to happen over here, and it's going to play out a little more than people thought, but very slowly. And the market's got to go to just the fact that we're going to have higher rates for the next six months or so. So, Sean, what do you think that means for the market action over the next couple of months? And did you hear anything this week, either from the Fed or from the jobs report this morning or earnings reports that really made you maybe change your view about the coming months? Well, thanks for having me. No, nothing I heard this week really change any other than the resounding announcement this morning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,88,2022-11-04 20:02:40
4901," It really made you maybe change your view about the coming months. Well, thanks for having me. No, nothing I heard this week really changed any other than the resounding announcement this morning on the job side, which sort of gives cover to the Fendt to continue their path forward in terms of aggressively raising interest rates. And so for the entire year, that's been the theme. High inflation, high interest rates means lower PEs for starting. We were seeing those PEs come down. They're now sort of still above historical levels, but down quite substantially, but that doesn't mean that they can't continue to fall. And so the advice we had been giving to people all year long is it's time for you to lower your overall portfolio's PEs before the market does it to you. It's done a fair amount and it probably can continue to do some more, but there are places in this market to make money. I think if you buy high quality stocks with high free cash flow or high free cash flow yield, you can buy stocks that are cheaper than the overall market unless susceptible to that multiple. And the contraction that always seems to go hand in hand with rising interest rates and rising inflation and the two standouts in our largest ETF that two standouts are two biggest sector weights are energy and health care with a little tilt. The third would be materials. And so we've been positioned pretty well and that fund is a large KBUS fund that's basically up for the year, even though the markets down more than 20%. And obviously we tend to watch the bond markets for any sort of signals anytime the Fed speaks so highly you're known as the convexity maven talk about the movement that you're seeing in bonds and what the volatility there is telling you. Well, I mean rate volatility is very high. So the move index, which is the the VIX for bonds is running around 141.50, which is basically it's price levels, but the reality is the market is moving that much every day. So it's legit the contrast of course is the VIX, it's 25, which is not that far above its long term average. It's talked to down 20% but it's been an orderly decline. We just don't know how far the Fed's going to take us and that's the uncertainty in bonds and that's why they're gapping up and down so much. But I will tell you that my view is that we're getting near the peak for the front end. The Fed might take rates to 475, maybe 5%, but the two year where it is right now is probably pricing in the right number. And what we don't know is the back end. Long term rates have not risen up. The curve's inverted and the inversion in the market market. You'll come very good at calling on recessions as calling for one next year and the markets pricing it out for recession sometime next year. Well we get that I don't know but that's the uncertainty of the stock market as we can't tell if earnings are going to drop or not. But the bottom market they've kind of got this thing pegged. Convexity, Maven, Harley, I like that. Sean, let me ask you about what you said earlier here when you talked about a negressive Fed. What do you think is most likely? I guess do you think a 75 basis point hike is on the table and how much of that has been priced into the market if at all at this point? Yeah, and so some of it probably has. But I think it's likely that you'll see 75 basis points out of the Fed this next move only because the job market continues to remain fairly strong. I think the things to watch from the Fed side is if they start to see massive demand destruction in terms of the overall economy and you start to see unemployment start to rise, then they'll be in a position where the perhaps they need to sort of ease up a little bit. I think that's what we're all hoping at some point that the Fed will ease. But I don't think I got anything out of what Chairman Powell said this week in any of the recent actions that would let me come to the conclusion that they're going to do anything other than what they said, which is continued to aggressively raise interest rates to try to tame inflation. John, what about the risk of the Fed going too far? Do you think that that is a possibility up until this point? You know, they hardly ever get it right. So, you know, they probably will go too far. You know, I have a different view on what the real problem is right now. I don't think it's an overheated economy. I think it's energy prices that are driving inflation across all parts of the sectors of our economy. And I think that's a supply issue, as opposed to a real interest rate driven solution. And so they probably will get it wrong. You know, the thing that you have to keep an eye on, it will tell you whether they're really getting it wrong is if inflation starts to peak, or pick up. And then guidance is really the most important thing going forward. So you've got a range on S&P earnings for next year, somewhere between $200 a share and $233 a share. So it's perhaps at the high end. But as these companies start to, you know, get through this fourth quarter and start to give.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,89,2022-11-04 20:06:38
4902," Thanks for the next year, somewhere between $200 who share and $233 shares, so perhaps at the high end. But as these companies start to get through this fourth quarter and start to give us a little hint for what's coming forward, if we see guidance sort of wane a little bit and move towards the downside, then that will tell you that we're probably not going to have this solved the landing in the stock market as the Fed really wants. So, Holly, if we go by their mantra, don't fight the Fed. What does this mean for how people should be balancing their portfolio as in preparation for recession as you're expecting in the next 12 months? Well, I would push back on our other guest over here a little bit. I think the Fed goes 15 next time. I think they're going to go higher than we thought, but they're going to get there slowly. They've already done four big hikes over here. The Minus Nest kind of worked for a little bit. I also don't think that it's actually oil energy per se. I think labor, cost of labor is the real driver over here. The demographics underlying that. What I like in the market, though, I think uni bonds and mortgage bonds have gotten brushed. And they're very solved. They're very safe. You're not taking credit risk with those securities. So, if we do get a recession, we do get the down earnings, we do get the unemployment. You're not going to get hurt with those two investments. Harley Basmonds, Sean O'Hara, we'll have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a good weekend. Thank you, YouTube. Coming up, Coinbase is jumping higher today after earnings, but in analysts, it tells us if you should be buying on that recent momentum, we'll be right back. Some of the big movers in today's session are crypto and payment services, Coinbase, PayPal and Block all moving after reporting earnings. We want to bring in Lisa Ellis, partner at Muffet, Nathan's in a division of SVB, and the securities. Lisa, it's good to see you cover all three of these companies. Thanks so much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,90,2022-11-04 20:11:34
4903," Nathan's in a division of SVB, a security is Lisa. It's good to see you cover all three of these companies. So you're the perfect person to have on to ask about this. Let's start with the movement that we've seen in block. We saw shares really take off today following the results that we got last night closing up just over 10% in a note out today. You wrote that after a wild ride over the past two and a half years, blocks business is emerging from the pandemic stronger than ever. Why? So in a couple ways, the cash app business, I'd say, is the real standout. That's their digital bank. They reported yesterday they're up to almost 50 million monthly active users in that product and about 18 million folks that use it like a primary bank account just for a point of reference. Like a JP Morgan or a city have about 30 million mobile bankers. So this is like more than half of where they are. Those are all consumers. What happened during the pandemic when banks were closed, right? And people were home. They downloaded and adopted something like cash app as a form of digital banking. And blocks just done a fantastic job of building an ecosystem around that and really, really pulled in those consumers. That product literally was almost zero five years ago and is now contributing more than half of the gross profits of the company. So, Lucy, in that digital wallet was a survey that you guys have, what stood out to you in terms of the demographics and really the opportunities for growth there? Yeah, it's true. What's interesting is that the digital banks skew younger in terms of cohorts, as you might imagine. But otherwise, there's no particular groups that stand out. They're not lower income. Sometimes there's a perception that the digital bank users are more unbanked. They are actually not. They're very mainstream. These are just simply individuals that are very mobile first and prefer to do all aspects of their life through mobile. But what cash app and what block are really doing there is they are trying to add services to move their way up market to adding investing services, adding lending products to migrate their way up to a more affluent consumer that has a higher spending power, which is how they generate a lot of the revenue for those products. Lucy, how are you looking at blocks crypto part of its business? Because revenue from Bitcoin this quarter, 1.76 billion, that was off about 3% from a year ago, slightly missing the streets expectations. Is this a risk? Do you think for the company given the activity or lack really thereof that we've seen in the crypto market, as of late? Well, it's not a risk in the sense that it runs through the income statement in kind of a funky way. So it shows up as a very big revenue line item and a very big cost item, but you really just net those out. And it's only a couple percent contribution to the gross profit of the company. But it is a very big engagement driver and usage driver. Like a reason people download these apps and really engage with the app's daily will be if they're very active in crypto. And so when we're in a low period like this, a block has to find other ways to engage consumers through other products. Like for example, they bought after pay, one of the big find-out pay later players who has very strong digital shopping services and they're starting to integrate some of that sort of shopping and kind of deals and promotion type of services into the app too. So Lisa obviously then talking about PayPal, which was one of the first names in this space, clearly losing market share to some of this competition here. What is the gross story then for PayPal at this point? They've also tried to add on some services as well. Yeah, PayPal's and it is true. It's there in a challenging position in the sense that they're the granddaddy of this space. They've been so dominant for so long that it's hard for them to maintain that level of a leadership position when you've got Apple Pay and you've got the players like a cash app or a buy-now pay later players kind of nipping away at their heels. So what PayPal has done, I mean, a part of their offering I would highlight is that they have, they bought a company called Brain Tree a number of years ago, which is the big competitor of Stripe and Audien. So more on the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,91,2022-11-04 20:15:15
4904," And highlight is that they bought a company called BrainTree a number of years ago, which is the big competitor of Stripe and Audien, so more on the merchant side. So providing the merchants with a wide set of services, the digital wallets, of course, and the checkout button, but also overall payment processing, things like loans for merchants. So they're sort of steering a lot of their business more toward the merchant side of the equation, where they compete, like I said, with player, you know, some of these big high growth players, like an Audien and a Stripe. Lisa, let's move over to Coinbase because we're seeing the stock pop today, close in the green, well in the green. Yet the company reported a wider loss, revenue was all 54%, shares down nearly 80% this year, yet you have an outperform rating on the stock. Why are you bullish on this name? I love Coinbase. I mean, there's a long-term play, there's no question. And the reality is we're likely, you know, historically crypto winters have typically lasted about two years and we're only about six or nine months into this one, so we've probably got a ways to go if history is any indicator. So there may not be arguably that much urgency, but in terms that we, I think of Coinbase as a very unique asset as a large cap, publicly listed player in crypto and way to play crypto, they're very differentiated in sort of the crypto infrastructure space. You're starting to see them doing these partnerships with a BlackRock or with a Google, where they're sort of the crypto inside, so to speak, where they're providing crypto onboard and capabilities digital assets storage, the ability to convert Fiat into crypto and sort of creating that, you know, they're the plumbing or the rails in those applications. And it's that aspect of their business that I get really excited about. For example, in this quarter, you know, yes, their kind of core transactional revenues are down significantly because just overall crypto trading activity is down, but their subscription and services businesses, which are all of these infrastructure type of services, were up over 40% quarter on quarter, that's sequentially, and are now almost a third of the revenues of Coinbase. And that's the piece I'd really be keeping an eye on over the next couple of years as it becomes a larger part of this business. Coinbase certainly growing with those partnerships, growing its ecosystem. Thank you, Dileesa Ellis. Great to see you have a wonderful weekend. Well, crypto exchange Binance reportedly processing billions of dollars in trades for Iranian firms as to spite US sanctions. Yavu Finance is Jen Shonbogen joins us now with the details, hey Jen. Good afternoon, Michelle. That's right, crypto exchange Binance reportedly processing Iranian transactions in value of nearly $8 billion since 2018, despite US sanctions aimed at cutting Iran off from the global financial system. Writers conducted an analysis with data from three firms that had access to chain analysis reactor investigation software and found that some $7.8 billion of funds flowed between Binance and Iran's largest crypto exchange, Nobitec. Three quarters of Iran's funds that pass through Binance were in a cryptocurrency called TRON. That gives users the option to conceal their identities according to Writers Analysis. Now, in a blog post today, Binance's head of global sanctions, Shagree Boyrez, wrote that as soon as Binance discovered that Iran-based crypto exchanges may have attempted to move crypto through Binance's exchange, the company quote, move to freeze transfers, block accounts, and follow the protocols that are by our compliance team. Boyrez went on to say, we immediately set up a task force to resolve the issue. Any failure of the system is unacceptable to us. And while Binance isn't a US company required to follow American law, we work hard to keep sanctioned individuals off our platform. Now, the head of sanction says Binance uses strong know your customer protocols and invests in technology to ensure that the people who should not be using Binance's exchange are not able to access their ecosystem. But admits the changes playing catch-up and that this is an industry-wide issue. Now, these new findings come as the US Department of Justice is pursuing an investing-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,92,2022-11-04 20:19:35
4905," But admits the dangers playing catch up and that this is an industry-wide issue. Now, these new findings come as the U.S. Department of Justice is pursuing an investigation into possible violations of money laundering rules by Binance. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to the Yahoo Finance for comment. And Treasury also declined to comment saying it does not weigh in on potential violations of U.S. sanctions. Guys. Well, certainly more scrutiny to come. I'm sure a big thank you to our very own Gen. Shonberg. Thanks so much. All right, well staying with crypto, Dogecoin's recent rally coming off the boil amid reports that Elon Musk might scrap or at least postpone his ambitions for some form of integration with Twitter. Online tech publication platformer reporting the social media group's plans over a crypto wallet quote, appear to be on pause. Now Dogecoin rallied over 50 percent the day Musk completed his takeover. And shot up 60 percent over the last seven days but clearly might lose some of their lustre. All right, coming up, former president Donald Trump keeping Republicans on edge about his 2024 plans, but he may finally be ready to make his decision for timeline straight ahead. Well, markets finished the week on upbeat note. The Dow did snap a four week winning streak, but tech still cannot catch a break. Sure as a Facebook parent company meta down more than 73 percent this year making it the worst performer in the S&P 500. And Michelle, we just were talking to Michael Wolf, Alastair, and he was telling us that the company made the phrase metaverse completely cringe worthy. And we see that reflected in the stock price we know meta has lost billions on their VR and AR initiatives, 9.4 billion. So far this year and those losses they're expected to continue to grow. I feel like Emerson's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,93,2022-11-04 20:24:03
4906," billions on their VR and AR initiatives, 9.4 billion, so far this year in those losses they're expected to continue to grow. I feel like Emerson's they changed the name from Facebook to Meta. It really has been something of a curse for them. Obviously they struggled with the Apple privacy laws affecting their revenue there. And really people are still waiting for Meta to get off the ground. Most people either don't know what it is, aren't really understanding the real world, but they're still using it beyond things like occasional gaming, which is what Michael Wolf was saying. Nobody wants to be stuck in a VR world for more than half an hour at a time. So I think this is going to be a long haul. Some people are estimating maybe 10 years before they'd be more widespread adoption. I don't know if investors are willing to wait that long. No, clearly not. Indeed. Exactly. Well, after the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe vs. Wade, voters appeared incensed enough to give Democrats momentum they needed heading into the midterms. But with the election just days away, high inflation and its effects on the economy appeared to be boosting Republicans' chances across the country. Well, for more we're joined by Jo, who financed senior columnist Rick Newman. So Rick, talk about these latest findings we're seeing. We just showed the charts showing that inflation has actually been improving gradually. The peak was at 9% in June. It's now down to 8.2%. Probably going to fall down to around 8% in the next report next week. But consumers actually are getting more worried about inflation, not less worried. And I dug into a big series of surveys the Census Bureau does on a regular basis to gauge how people are doing. They started it this after COVID. And it shows that more people say they are having trouble paying for daily bills now than said so in June when inflation was actually higher and it's considerably higher than it was a year ago. So I think this says two things. One, I think it says, on the longer inflation lasts, the more worried people get about it as they probably should because it's not just going to come and go. It's going to be here and we're going to have sustained price acts for a long time. And I think there probably is also a cumulative impact on family budgets. So when prices go up and stay up, it just is draining and draining and draining over time. And maybe a lot of families can handle one month of higher than expected costs. But when that goes on month after month after month, it gets tougher. And the same sort of everybody, the Census Bureau also shows that more people now are tapping into savings or putting everyday expenses on credit cards. So I think this is why you have seen voters even as gas prices come down. Other bills are going up and voters know that. I mean, they're seeing this every week when they pay bills. And this is why Biden just cannot catch a break even though other parts of the economy notably the job market and the numbers we got today are pretty good. So I think, I mean, we have seen Democratic odds of holding onto Congress just deteriorating for the last month or so. And barring a miracle, they're going to lose either one or both houses next week. Yeah, I'm rick speaking on this momentum that we certainly have seen with the GOP party here as of recent weeks. There's an Axios report out earlier today saying that Trump was potentially eyeing an announcement of the 2024 of his 2024 presidential run on November 14th. I'm just curious, just your reaction to this and just what this signals here for Republicans over the next two years. My reaction is let the circus begin, baby. Let's get started. This is not necessarily good for Republicans. So there's a lot going on behind the scenes here. First of all, many people who are following the never ending Trump spectacle think there's a good chance the federal government could bring charges against him for for his mishandling of classified documents down at his home in Florida after he left the White House. He was not supposed to have classified documents. He did. We that could have been quite alarming. And the Trump probably as it's almost part of his legal defense. You can imagine that he wants to make himself a presidential candidate if the Justice Department is going to go after him so that it makes it look as if it's purely political, which it is not, by the way. He's also facing a very serious lawsuit in Georgia over possible election fraud. There's a grand jury on that with possible charges by sometime next year. Again, Trump probably thinks it will help him out if this looks politically motivated because he's a political candidate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,94,2022-11-04 20:28:16
4907," There's a grand jury on that with possible charges by sometime next year. Again, Trump probably thinks it will help him out if this looks politically motivated because he's a political candidate being prosecuted by a Democrat in Fulton County, Lanna. So there's that element to it. Then there's the whole question of the Florida Governor Ron DeSantis try to run in 2024 as well. Perhaps a more conventional campaign not launched two years ahead of time, but maybe more like 18 months or one year ahead of time. Which would put Trump into Santhus at odds with each other. So that would probably be quite a smackdown. And let's just make sure everybody understands. Trump standing in the Republican Party has declined. I think there are polls now that say, the majority of Republicans say Trump should not run again. So if he does run, it is by no means a given that he would win. Certainly we'll be entertaining watch to say the least. Rick Newman, as always, thanks so much. Have a good weekend. Hi guys, you too. All right, well, come here. Next out of office, companies are rethinking the real estate plans. But how much of a hit does this mean that this sector can take? We speak with the next word from JLL. Next. All right. All right, but sorry about OK. Okay. You This is our rethinking how and where their employees work. Many companies decide not to resign leases in favor of keeping their workers at home. Exxon mobile might be joining them. There's a report in the journal today that the oil joint is considering leasing or selling its unused office space in Houston. The company reporting that only a fraction of its less than half of the available office space that it has on its Houston campus is being used. For more on this and what this means for the commercial real estate market, we want to bring in John Gates, JLL CEO of America's markets. John, it's good to see you Exxon far from the only company. We also heard metad making a similar move in and Atlanticdot? We've been thinking about the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,95,2022-11-04 20:32:52
4908," a bring in John Gates, J-L-L-C-E-O of America's markets. John, it's good to see you, Exxon, far from the only company. We also heard meta making a similar move in Austin earlier this week. Is this consistent with the trends that you're seeing? The corporate America, probably global corporate, still sort of struggle with what return to the office is going to mean on a permanent basis. So we think hybrid work in some form of fashion is here to stay for many companies. And there are some workers that probably would continue to work from home or work remotely much, if not all of the time. Yes, but there is a greater return to office probably that people are aware of right now. And John, what's the regional story? Where are you seeing the most growth when it comes to the return to office story? It is definitely, there is a regional story. So in the United States, that would be across the South. The immigration markets, we call them, but Phoenix is a winter, Metro Dallas is a winter. Austin is a winter, Nashville, Charlotte, Atlanta, certainly South Florida, the Metro Miami area. So it's almost across the board in the larger cities or metro areas across the Southern US. John, you mentioned it was a little bit greater than we think outside of those top cities. What are we seeing play out in the rest of the country? And what did the vacancy rates look like? It definitely varies by city, right? So industries and geographies vary, but it is taking up nationally to very close to 50%. And we're predicting that by the end of the first quarter, could be as high as 60% on an average day, which is a pretty good metric. Office buildings have never been 100% full, right? People come and go, they travel from business, they have personalized that they're working with. So, but vacancy rates are higher in those southern cities, and then the other very strong trend we see is what we call a flight to quality. So newer, you know, better space, more monetized, maybe a better location, closer to public transportation. Space that has a cool factor to it. It's got maybe a good retail amenities in the neighborhood. Those buildings are definitely leasing at a materially higher rate. And they have much greater occupancy than older product does. And John, what do you see in terms of leasing and rental prices? How do they stack up versus pre-pandemic? Tail of two cities. So if we take the last comments for the newer product, the flight to quality, we're seeing all-time peak rents set in probably two-thirds of the big markets in the United States in the last 12 counter months, probably even this year. So that's very different than what we're seeing happen with older office buildings, where they're struggling to maintain rents as high as they had pre-pandemic. So it's very binary in that regard, I would say. John, when you take this and also, I guess, combine the fact that we're in a rising rate environment right now, the Fed saying it's going to remain committed to raising rates that obviously could spell some trouble here for commercial real estate. I'm curious just how this has impacted your investment opportunities. And are you being more conservative given the current macro environment? You're probably more conservative, more disciplined in your decision making, depending on where you're looking. Interest rates, excuse me, commercial office space rely on long-term capital and often debt is part of the capital structure in those. And so the cost of capital is going up. It's going up for all operating businesses as well. And so you're selective in where you look. We see a slowdown in velocity of both sales of assets right now in commercial mortgages. There's a lot less construction activity and any kind of commercial asset class. And I think that'll continue for a while because as you know, the Fed has been very clear that they're not done. And John, is there any sense of when you might see this normalizing at some point? I would think at the end of the first quarter, maybe. I think business people, whether they're investors or operators and operating businesses, want to see trends. And so, inflation's ticked out a little bit. If it starts, if it clearly to business people is moving downward and the Fed's actions are working, that gives a little more predictability to people. And I think you'll start to see transaction activity increase at that time, whether it's signing commercial leases or selling assets or recapitalizing and refinancing them. So, you know, my sense would be that's probably late Q1 or maybe early Q2, but we'll need to can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,96,2022-11-04 20:36:56
4909," or selling assets or recapitalizing and refinancing them. So, you know, my sense would be that's probably late Q1 or maybe early Q2, but we'll need to continue to watch. There's a lot of been flashering pressure out there still. And as we look through the supply chain, whether it's things like labor and in developing some of these things, as well as some of the construction materials prices, what are some of the headwinds or what are some of the pricing that you're expecting there? I think labor will be a greater challenge than supply chain disruptions and spikes in materials cost. Much of the supply chain is renormalized. You see container shipments as an example. The cost of container shipments have come back and the demand for materials has slowed. When you move interest rates as much as they have, you see construction activity really slow down. It has a major impact on the single family housing market, as we all know, and mortgages get very, very expensive. So you see a smaller velocity of people moving and you certainly see a dramatic slow down in construction starts. We have a labor shortage though in our country and our economy. And I think that continues in non-office working jobs for sure. And we have a lot of stimulus still coming. So I think construction spend will shift to maybe ESG related activities, for example, and that needs work and labor as well. So I think materials will be less of a problem, supply chains, and cost of materials will be less of a problem than availability of labor and probably the cost of labor. Certainly a lot to keep an eye on. We do appreciate you breaking all this down for us, John Gates. Thank you so much. Have a great week. Thank you for having me. All right, coming up, fans of Weird Al Yankovich songs like Armageddon Paradise and like a surgeon will be rushing to turn on the Roku channel this weekend or details on the new film next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,97,2022-11-04 20:41:28
4910," It's been a busy week of earnings here. Some of the biggest movers of the week. Let's kick it off with Roku. It's the top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance over the last couple of days. It shares, really took a dive. You can see it reflected in this five-day chart here after a wider than expected loss during the quarter, just another company to suffer from the pullback that we've seen in ads spending shares hitting the lowest level that we've seen since 2019. The week results leading to a number of downgrades on the street. Pivotal research lowering its rating on the stock to sell from hold to Guggenheim, cutting its rating to neutral from by the five-day move in the chart shares closing off just around 9% just below 50 bucks a share. Let's move over to Peloton another wild week in this stock. Although you can see the weekly gains of just over 17% shares initially sold off after the company disappointed the street with its earnings, but they were reassured by some comments that we got from CEO Barry McCarthy, Barry McCarthy making some comments on the turnaround plan. Saying that it was further along, then maybe the street had progressed, saying, quote, the ship is turning. Taking a look at the week to date chart up just around 17% still though below 10 bucks a share. We'll also take a look at Uber another big mover earlier in the week shares soared after the company posted a revenue beat and strong guidance closing Tuesday up 11% sales during the third quarter from 72% from just a year ago for the week. You see a bit of those muted gains, so giving back it at the latter end of the week with Uber closing up just around 3% 28.39 a share. Now let's round it out with Starbucks as we take a look at that five-day chart up just around 5.5% having its best day today and about six months is not closing up just around 8.5% 91.86 a share. Third quarter earnings, beef is street's expectations. Also the company issuing strong fourth quarter guidance. A number of analysts boosting their price targets as a result, RBC upping its target to 80. Bucks credit suites up in there as to 105 Goldman, lifting their price target to 98 bucks a share all about where Starbucks is trading today again for the week shares closing up just around 5.5% for sure. All right, great stuff. Well now here's a look at what we're keeping in mind on Fort next week. On Monday, a quiet day on the economic calendar, but we will get results from Palantir, Lyft and Gaming Giants Activision Blizzard and Take 2 Interactive. And of course the big event on Tuesday, the midterm elections. But on the earnings front there are some key names to watch, especially Disney after the close. Also here from AMC, Occidental Petroleum, Affirm and a CUMI. On Wednesday, roadblocks, Wendy's and Home Builder DR Horton, among the names that are going to be reporting their quarterly earnings. And on Thursday we'll get some economic data including jobless claims, but all eyes will be on the consumer price index, which is out ahead of the open. On the earnings front, retailers Ralph Lauren and Tapestry will also report. And finally, rounding out the week on Friday, we'll get the latest reading on consumer sentiment, certainly lots, for the Fed to digest. Well Twitter offices closed today as employees and now former employees were told earlier they're being laid off or fired via email. And the backlash, now raising the question, in this time of working from home, how do you fire people respectfully? Or quit your job for that matter? Now prior to the pandemic, it was customary to have an in-person conversation, but how have norms shifted in our Slack message and Zoom meeting world shorter? Is there a good way to do it? Do you want to have people travel from wherever they are just to show up and get fired? I think that might be worse. Yeah, that could be worse. And obviously if they live far away, you would have a tough time. I think bringing them into the office, just alone, just knowing what you're going to do. But I don't think you should do this over Slack or through an email. I think if you aren't located in the office, if you're not seeing your boss on a day-to-day basis, set up a Google Meet, set up a Zoom. That is so common these days. And I think that is much more acceptable if you're not in the office every day. If you're in the office every day, you clearly should be having that in-person conversation. I think people that are making the decision to do this, maybe tend to be on the younger side of the workforce. So I don't really understand, I guess, how-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,98,2022-11-04 20:45:41
4911," A younger side of the workforce, I don't really understand, I guess, how small certain industries can be. You don't want to burn any bridges. And I think you're likely to do that if you do quit via Slack or email. It's true. I mean, you have some people just announcing that they're leaving their jobs on TikTok, which is a horrible, horrible trend, a horrible idea. But I think, as you mentioned, at least if you can't be face-to-face in person, at least over video chat. I'm not one of these horrible, sort of, mass-firing. It's just one-on-one. Just like it was when you hired the person, give them that same respect on the way out. I think that's you. I think that's the tasteful way to do it. It's not an easy conversation to ever have, but at least try and make it as respectful as you can. It'll be worth having it face-to-face. We're in agreeance on that. Hopefully, people watching also agree with that as well. All right, moving on to another story that we're watching your big day for Roku, the streaming platform, releasing its original biopic film, Weird the Ow, Yank of X Story. Yeah, we're financing this, Al Jender, Canal, it joins us now with more, and Alie, when you take a look at Roku's move here, I guess, what is this signal just in terms of its content push? This is certainly Roku's biggest original yet. It really adds to this push from the company to try its hand at original programming. You saw Daniel Rackliff just there. He is in the title role. We also have other really strong A-list stars like Evan Rachel Wood, Rain Wilson. I will say, if you think back to some of the other streaming giants, like a Netflix or an Apple TV Plus, there was always that one show, that one movie that really solidified their spot in the streaming wars, had everyone sort of look at them a little differently. This could be the thing for Roku. I remember for me for Netflix, it was Halse cards, Apple TV Plus, I think you could argue Ted Lasso. This film is a success. That could be something huge for Roku moving forward. Of course, Roku is free, so you can watch this for free, but it will have ads because Roku's business model really relies on ads. We saw that really impact earnings as you were dispensiting this past quarter. If Roku can be successful with this original content push, they can keep people within the ecosystem and really monetize that, that's more revenue opportunity for them moving forward. This could potentially be a game changer. Yeah, it couldn't really be. I will say for that weird-out movie, still hard for me to see Daniel Rackliff as anybody else on the Mid-Harris Potter, but you know- You're a man, that's my eye. That's my eye. Yeah. Now I also want to talk about James Cameron's avatar at the way of the water. That set to hit theaters December 16th. Now, 20th Century Studios releasing the official trailer. Take a listen. So what does her heart beat sound like? Mighty. Now it does look gorgeous, but it is long. So Ali, do you expect Avatar the way of the water to be a box office blowout? I really do. I mean, this film takes place 10 years from where the original film left off. And of course, it's been 13 years since we first saw the original movie. That's why theaters have been re-releasing it in theaters. And that's actually been very successful. It's added to box office gains. So even though this is a 13-year-old movie, people are still going to the theater. They want to refresh their memory so that they are fully prepared for when this sequel debuts on December 16th. When I went to Disney's D23 convention, they actually showed five very long clips of this. And I got to say, people were owing and awing. The film was very excited in the crowd. The cinematography was amazing. James Cameron, he really wanted this film to debut in a theater. He wanted to wait until the technology was there. So I think there's a lot of hype around this film. And I certainly think it's going to be one of the biggest movies, probably the biggest movie of the year. Of course, it will follow Marvel's Wakanda forever. So just a lot to look forward to at the box office as we round out 2023. And it will set us up for hopefully the successful 2024 because we are still below pre-pandemic levels. We'll see how the way of water can add to those. I mean, I will say it's visually stunning. If there's ever a movie you're going to want to see on the big screen, it does seem to be this. Three hours, though. I don't know if you'd want to bring the kids. We already saw it with the Irishman and things like that. People are having to watch it. We're going to focus on the process we set the speaker in on both of the forwards. We are not going to force those thoughts on theopes of leads, not to every second for a unseren or 다른 issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,99,2022-11-04 20:50:12
4912," Bix, we need does seem to be this. Three hours though, I don't know if you'd want to bring the kids. You know, we already saw it with the Irishman. It's like that people are having to watch it in segments just so they can get through it. Three hours is a pretty long time. It took me three days to watch the Irishman. I totally, I don't know if that speaks to my attention span or the quality of the film. I don't really know. But yes, it is a long movie. I do think our attention spans a short end. We'll see, but I don't think that's going to stop people for this one. I don't know, Shana. I feel like people are ready for it. I think people who saw the first avatar will be very excited to return to the theaters. I also think they have a massive selling point in. If you watch this at home, it simply is not the same experience. You need to watch it in theaters. I think it's going to be a massive, massive thing. Thank you. We'll see. All right, Ali, can I have a good weekend? All right, coming up next. You've got one in 292 million, that's all chance, of winning the Power Ball tomorrow night. And maybe tiny, but that's still a chance. So if you do win, what next? We'll tell you exactly what to do when we come back. Thank you. $1.6 billion. That's the power of Jackpot. Now making it the largest on record. And of course you still have plenty of time to buy a ticket ahead of the drawing tomorrow nights. So what happens if you strike it big? Or Wells Fargo, Wealth and Investment Managing Director Emily Irwin joined us now with a look at what to do if you're lucky enough to win big. So obviously a lot of people get very excited about this but it's important to have a plan in place. Talk about some of the initial steps people should be taking. Absolutely. And thank you for having me. The first thing to really consider is putting a communication plan in place. And that communication plan is comprised of with whom are you going to share this big news when and how.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKBKnaqZiYM,100,2022-11-04 20:54:39
4913," really consider is putting a communication plan in place. And that communication plan is comprised of with whom are you going to share this big news, when and how. And so thinking about the who, friends and family, keeping that circle tight and close, and ensuring that no one's going to share the news on your behalf is key. Secondly, you want to comprise a team. And thinking about assembling that team, you very often can have up to a year to claim that powerball ticket. And so thinking about that team to help you buy some time, considering how to take the payments, thinking about an attorney, an accountant, a charitable advisor, as well as an investment advisor. And then finally, how are you going to share the news? After you determine that it's the time to go claim your winnings, are you going to be able to minimize any scammers by ensuring some privacy, this is very state by state, but this is certainly not the time to post yourself in your winning ticket on social media. Emily, and then of course you have the massive decision or whether you should go with the lump sum, which in this case would be right around $782 million, or if you should opt for that yearly payout. What should people consider? And I guess what advice do you have for that lucky winner if you do get a winner in this drawing? Well, when you're thinking about the lump sum, of course, you're going to have more control over how you invest those assets. And for many, that is critical to their decision making. They like the assuriveness that they're going to receive those winnings and be able to determine how to invest or spend them over the years. By contrast, if you're someone who you have a dollar in your pocket and you're going to spend it, an annuity might be a better strategy for you. Or if you're someone that you think you're going to have a hard time saying no, whether it's to friends or family or organizations, you might want a little bit more peace of mind knowing that every single time that your calendar turns over, you're going to be receiving another payment. And so I think part of it is behavioral finance. How do you interact with your finances? And part of it is how much control do you want? And how much do you want to have that money now versus having it doled out over a number of years? So really have to understand your financial personality before making a decision like this. Now, obviously, we read a lot of heartbreaking stories about people who won the lottery and end up going bankrupt, going broke. What are some of the mistakes that people should really try and avoid? What are some of the don'ts? Yeah, unfortunately, there are those individuals that that winning ticket is something they wish they never had in their hand. And so some best practices are put a plan in place and put a budget in place, as insane as that sounds. For someone who's going to win that ticket, this will very likely catapult them into a different financial stratosphere. Not only what are the outlays of cash that they expect over the next few years, but what are the ongoing maintenance costs of those types of expenses? And it might be something that they're not used to, a financial plan or an investment plan with scenarios and analysis supporting all of their wishes and goals can really help bring some dollars and cents to maybe some of their hopes. And then secondly, thinking about ways to really communicate with those around you as you may be seen as a bank within your community going forward, making sure that you have some sort of a mission statement or a intentional giving statement. So you have the flexibility and peace of mind to be able to say yes and say no as you're approached by different individuals and organizations. All right, Emily Irwin. Emily, real quick, are you playing? Absolutely. I already have my tickets. Oh, good. Good for you. I was going to have to run out and buy one. All right, Emily Irwin, great to have you. Richelle, how about you? Absolutely. I bought my ticket yesterday. I'm not fooling around with the rush today. I was like, I bought mine. I'm ready. What would you spend it on if you won it?
