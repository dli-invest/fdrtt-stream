The first is interest rates. Obviously, the feds battle with inflation has been the key mover of equity market so far this year. The bad news is we've seen the PE multiple for the S and P 500 fall from 21 times at the start of the year to just 15 times now so you've seen a massive D rating the good news is this is roughly appropriate with that Currently market pricing is about in line with what our economists expect from the fed. For the next several meetings and with real treasure yields around one. Five% on the tenure. That's about fair value. The other key driver of course is earnings and here too we think estimates are getting close to where they need to be. We've seen some pretty clear In the last several months we still think there's a little bit more downward moves likely to come but we think consensus earnings estimates are getting close to where they should be 3600 that is our newly revised year end target for this year so we think the market is pretty close to fair value Positioning in flows. And over you've seen a very very sharp D rating in markets this year and accordingly we've seen a very sharp degree of selling from our institutional investor clients this is appropriate in our view but also raises the risk that if we get some data in the next couple months that is slightly better than expected we could see a pretty sharp rebound especially as ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZtRLAJ6j4,35,2022-10-03 16:20:37

Do you think the same? Yeah, I think there is upside to oil right now. What is remarkable that we're talking about opac curtailing production at a time where the inventories globally are at the lower end of the historical range and you're looking at it in the market which is highly back related which is a state where the prompt prices Bob deferred prices which is typical when a market is tight and there's and consumers are willing to pay a premium for immediate delivery. If you look at the carry in the oil market succeeding 15% which is on the operator of historical range to think that Opec is taking this as a time to cut is really without historical president and if they do so, they're gonna To keep the inventories low. Which will keep upward prices. There are likely doing this to one preempt any potential demand slowdown. But also in my mind they're doing it to reflect the fact That their spare capacity is towards the bottom of historical range. It's sort of like driving a car with your foot pressed down all the way to the metal and you're starting to get feedback and vibrations in this system and I think as a result, they wanna move off of their production that they're at right now.

I guess how effective are they typically or do you think they would potentially be? So it's being sold right now when you're talking about oil specifically As an attempt to get around European sanctions do you agree to a price cap we'll wave some of these sanctions on an unshipping and insurance and hopefully that will grease the wheels but that is not ultimately how the market should function and I think the price cap could likely backfire in part because Russia holds a say and how much they're willing to sell and to who and at what price? And Nate and we've seen small reductions and export volumes could have outside impact and prices particularly when the market is tight. Now, in Europe, the problem is it sends the wrong incentives to the consumers. Particularly if there's some That aren't capped they will have a higher burden just to bear if the market is tight so for example if you're gonna cap residential commercial industrial end users will have ultimately higher prices to manage through the the demand rational that needs to happen Surprise caps are really not the ultimate solution Than they're hoping for.

So call when we look at things like affordability what consumers are willing to spend on is there a sweet spot right now in terms of the kinds of models that consumers want to buy? You know, they've always wanted flexibility and that's why SUVs become so popular over the last 10 plus years. It's the idea that one car conserves so many different purposes. So, you're still gonna always have that that SUV flexibility be one of the focuses of consumer demand and that's why so many car companies have switched Generally toward SUVs versus cars but it also means that if you're able to buy without getting an SUV if you can get by with the Sudan You get a much better price versus an SUV which everyone wants.

Yeah, in terms of the decreases in job openings, the largest ones were actually in health care and social assistance. You saw 236 1000 That kind of came out of the equation there. You saw other services decreased by 183 1000 then retail trade in the retail sector. You saw that come down by about 143 1000.

So again, that's the that's kind of the like profile. The next 6 months gonna be very clear Clearer not very clear you know we've been talking a lot about jobs I'm curious to ask you about housing yeah because we talk about housing a lot and how much mortgage rates have gone up and how it's there it's a problem of affordability but when you talk about it as an Driver how concerned are you about housing? Well, that is an interest rate sensitive sector so when the fed tightens or any central bank titans, it's not uniform across the economy. You're gonna look at the interest rate sensitive sectors and they should be feeling the pain first. That's housing durable goods etcetera. So, the housing starts we have a couple of funny prints recently but that should be Going down, housing demand should be slowing down as the prices should be leveling off but again, you're looking for an narrative that's gonna deceleration rather than tanking but do you know the mortgage rates are pushing seven% right now, right? Not too long ago, they were three and some of us luckily locked in lower than that but that's that's a big affordability issue. So, that should be, you know, breaking the economy But again, if people have jobs, they think they're gonna keep their jobs. They're gonna continue to spend. The moderate they're spending for, you know, lower acid prices or you know, bit higher inflation but that's the sector. One of the sectors that's on the short list. Yeah. If we start to see that really go pear shape, then Might be in the recession scenario rather than the slowdown scenario. So, we have housing prices coming into wraps. We have consumers worried about even rising interest rates and we have the market's terrible year for the markets. Many parts of it. How does this impact consumer spending into 2023?

If that's not coming down meaningfully after Sort of nice scenario we're talking about and then we get your down like Julie but I think that's not a baseline right now. Oh nope. Another contributor to that the inflationary pressures that we have seen has been energy costs as well and even as we think about what a US recession may look like, there's also what we were discussing earlier in the show in And some of the cutting and some of their production. What that may mean in Europe but also how much the European or a global recession more broadly may also trickle into the US economy. Yeah, I mean, energy, oil prices are in the 80s right On Opec's gonna talking that looks like strategically they might wanna kinda keep them in that zone but energy prices are down quite a bit right so going around town there were five handles on gas not too long ago an hour in the three so that That's source of inflation has come down the supply chain source of inflation has come down food still a bit elevated but if we put all that in sort of a non-core bucket that part of the inflation is pulling down the headline numbers but the We just talked about 2 minutes ago which is the core is still going up. So, that's gonna help. If that helps drag down the other stuff, that's good but you know, we still have a core inflation problem in this country and a lot of other countries and that's what Central Banks have to look at Other stuff is great for the headline but they're really focused on the the core.

I don't have a number in my head but I mean I think this narrative is what we would wanna see kind of a deceleration the unemployment rate bottom to what three and a half and then were three seven that's probably gotta go into the mid fours maybe a bit higher but that's kind of the narrative about where where we're going on the jobs market but again it's the lag right so we've got three big rate hikes in a row and that's gonna filter through the next couple of months but if we get Deceleration story going on those numbers or maybe we can expect to see put things in the market while we're on that track you've you've generally lowered your forecast for GDP growth in 2022 and and 2023 and raise your forecast for Perhaps there's a marker on the inflation side that that you're keeping tabs on. Yeah, well, you know, you can torture the inflation numbers, however, you want, so the headlines eight three, the core PCE, which is what the Fed actually follows is four. Six, and the target two. So, whatever sort of flavor you We're way above target. We're gonna need to continue to slow and I think again, that's part of the the lag thing, you know, the even sequentially we torture and get the last 3 months of data.

The same time that allows them to be more efficient and They will look at employment base during any recession. Now, having said that, what I what I think is fascinating is that as business leaders, you know, we live through an early recession in the pandemic and we saw a quick rebound in the economy and some of us learned lessons from maybe having some employees leave the organization that we regret leaving and then, we faced into the great resign Shortly thereafter. So, I think CEOs are recognized that people are their greatest asset and they're going to be I think generally cautious about any kind of workforce reductions. You also tackled within this ESG and how CEOs increasingly agree that these programs improve financial performance even in the face of an economic pullback You advising CEOs how are you kind of listening to where CO's are going to be able to maintain some of these very important movements that they've made forward especially An entire kind of upheaval of the way that they had approached diversity equity and inclusion in the past. And how that really dovetails even into their own financial results and performance So, I think ESG is here for the long term.

So, there's two 1 million barrel cuts really only gonna be about 800 1000 to a one 1 million if they actually were to reach maximum here So, the length of it is disturbing to me. The length of time that they're going to do this because this means that it can do and they're they've announced they're gonna have meetings every other month now. Which prior to that, they said that they would be at a need to know basis. Every other month means they can adjust as both up or down and it seems like they're target is more to Production now.

Noting that wholesale used vehicle prices fell 2.3 per cent per cent per cent from August in the first 15 days of September so prices are really starting to to come down here as I think a lot of would be buyers are blocking it some of the interest rates are getting on these loans in many cases above a seven percent price declines according to the manheim index the steepest in full size and sports car in sports cars some of the higher so some of the higher priced offerings here and we have that manheim chart two now of course we saw a big spike and used car vehicle prices at a lot of the market and we saw a big spike and used car vehicle prices at around the pandemic is everybody needed a car they wanted a car they were out there traveling more they were doing stacations or just staying home now they've also then they also when they start to return to the office they went out there and bought cars they don't want to take public transportation but now all those dynamics I would argue are no longer in play at the extent they were we're now we're seeing prices come down alongside of a slowing economy now the losers from the slow down in the use vehicle market or of course car max where there's very ugly report auto nation is pretty much the same as car max in terms of business model carvana the online focused retailer of used vehicles and then you have a hurts and a Davis now why did I include them in here because you know a lot of times their stocks trade off the perceived value of the inventory or the car inventory that hurts in in avis own so those car prices are coming down that's less of a valuation or less value assigned to the hurts and avis budget rental fleets or their inventories over a good quote here so I'll just add to from Adam Jonas Morgan Stanley noting car max might be first on and feeling the impact of the use car decline but we expect the entire retail auto retail franchise and auto credit complex to follow so something to keep in mind from Adam my take is this auto retail stocks are probably dead money for right now I know if you're happy there I'm getting ready to go out for crews my sunglasses on but still it's going to be hard to find positive catalyst for some of these names in the coming months. You know it's really interesting on especially the use car side when we think about the rental parts of that business that you mentioned to I almost bought my first car from enterprise actually because I had known and there are a lot of people out there that take advantage of this after they do find out that it hurts that a avis that an enterprise that they actually do sell used cars because sometimes they're just trying to work through old inventory that they have in order to get newer vehicles that are going to be able to be rented out and have better maintenance cycles over a longer period of time knowing how many times those keys are changing hands to. Did you buy it? I didn't know. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I was about to have like throw out 300,000. They have a lot of models. Yeah I mean some of them as low as what 18,000 miles and then some of them you're getting out of the hundreds of thousands. 100,000 miles you're like yeah I don't need that. I don't need that. All right we're going to break down more of the market action. I'm going to have to break sick around. Go Rangers. Now go Brake. Go Rangers. Go Rangers. Go Rangers. Go Rangers. Go Rangers.

2683," oke October already shaping up to be a volatile month after the S&P 500 posted its worst monthly return since March 2020 in September. Our next guest says any future rallies in the market will be muted. She says, let's bring you BlackRock America's eye shares investment, a strategy head, Gargie Chaudry, Gargie, it's good to see you. Fade those rallies, you say. Why should folks be thinking that way? Good morning, Julie. Good to be here. So I think that a few times we've seen this deal already that the market has prepositioned for a Fed pivot. And what we've learned over and over again from the various Fed because that has spoken this week and previously is that they're not quite ready to do that yet. So to the extent that we're not getting a fully dovish pivot from the Fed, I think any time that the equity market rallies like it did the first two days of October with those two massive moves that we hadn't seen since April 2020, every time we see moves like this, I think we're supposed to fade them. Now look, I'll say that you're still supposed to be invested in certain corners of the equity market. But broadly, I think that there will still be some more volatility and pain ahead, especially as we continue to see the data slow down and perhaps even grapple with the recession. Would you believe prompted some of the early quarter rally that we'd seen? Yeah, I think that some of that was just positioning. I think a lot of people, as you guys know and talk about often, became really bearish. So there was that crazy price action, I would say. And some of that was just positioning. So a rally based on just the short positioning out there. Some of it was like I had said earlier that this expectation or this view that the Fed would pivot, think back to two months ago where we did see one soft CPI print and we saw a huge amount of rally in the equity markets on the back of that. Then of course, last month, we saw a very strong CPI print and we gave back a lot of that rally. So I think this back and forth between the direction of rate and between the direction or the estimation of a pivot from the Fed is going to drive equity markets in the future. And I still believe that we are going to continue to see a little bit of slowing down. I mean, earnings growth will have to slow from here. And I think that's still going to play out in the equity market. So stay invested. Be in minimum volatility, be in energy equities, be in healthcare. But broadly, is this rally going to persist? I don't think so. And Gargi, we just are hearing from Neil Cash.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,2,2022-10-06 13:57:57
2684," be an energy equities, be in healthcare. But broadly, is this rally going to persist? I don't think so. And Gargi, we just are hearing from Yelp Keshkari who's participating in a Q&A. The head one that caught my eye sort of echoes what you've been talking about. He said the bar to shifting our stance on policy is very high. You know, it sort of emphasizes, right? Don't get ahead of yourself folks and look for the pivot. If their bar is very high to shifting their stance, what are you looking for for them to go over that bar? What signals are you looking for from the economic data that actually would cause maybe, okay, let's not even say a pivot, even a pause or a slow down in their strategy. Sure thing, Julie. I think that's the most important question. And I think the Fed has tried to be transparent about it. So they will need to see, or their expectations of inflation will need to come down. They will need to see a few months of data where inflation is decelerating, not accelerating, and moving closer to that target of 2% on 4 BCE. We haven't seen that yet. And again, one number does not print things. So it will have to be a more of a three or four prints of decelerating inflation, certainly on the core inflation. So that's number one. Another way in which I think we could, so that's the most important. But secondly, I think that the Fed could pause, again, not pivot, maybe just stay, stay with it, if you will. I think they would, if they started to see a significant slowing in the labor market. And that's something that the Fed has made very clear that they want to see the labor market slow down. Now, if we see a couple of months of maybe a hundred thousand prints on the payroll, I think that's possible that we can hear the Fed talking about a slow-up out of policy or a pause in the months ahead. But again, it's not one month. It's a few months. And then finally, I think we did, obviously learn a lot from the Bank of England. We are not in the same position as the UK at all, they're different dynamics in the market. But I will say that if there is any kind of market functioning questions that arise in the US, and again, we're not there now. But if that does happen in 2023, I think that could be a way in which the Fed indicates to us that they will not be raising rates in a significant manner, or at least that the bar has come down. Gary, we're coming up against two interesting market moving events. We have the Fed meeting November 2nd, and then a couple of days later, we have the midterm election. So let's say this, let's say the Fed comes out here, reiterates their hawkish tone. We get that out of the way. Next day, after the elections we learn, we're going to have divided government. What happens to the stock market in your view into your end? I think it's going to be very difficult for the stock market to have the rallies that we saw in the first two days of October in that situation. Now look, a lot of things will drive the stock market. I don't want to base it entirely upon the Fed and elections only. Obviously, we have a blockbuster earnings season. That's something that will obviously be a big driver of the market. But all of a sequel, if you're just giving me a hawkish Fed and a divided government, I think it's just going to be really hard for the equity market to make new highs or to get back to levels that we had seen perhaps in the second quarter of this year with that framework. I think we really need to see a fundamental shift in the earnings picture where earnings growth is very healthy across all sectors. And I just don't see how that happens when we have an economy that is slowing down because the Fed wants it to. All right, thanks, Gargie. Good to catch up with you. BlackRock America's I-Share's investment strategy head, Gargie Chaudry. Thanks so much. Coming up, the recent surge in mortgage rates is causing Americans to rethink, home buying, will the rates stay at these levels? We actually have a little bit of relief, maybe.

2685," is Welcome back to Y'all of Finance. I'm Brian Saazi here with Julie Heimann and Brad Smith markets are tiptoeing into Friday's crucial jobs report. It's seen some mixed action across the board amongst the major indices but for right now at this particular moment in time, all three major indices in the red. Julie over to you with some breaking news on a market. You follow very closely that is mortgage rates. Well now I do like everyone 6.6% 6.66% is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac that information just coming out. It is a very very slight improvement over the 6.7% that we talked about last week as Freddie Mac's chief economist points out rates remain quite high compared to just one year ago. Meaning housing continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers. This is something that we have talked a lot about the real world implications of having these higher mortgage rates that are more than double where they were a year ago. The people are just going to pay a lot more over the life of the mortgage. It also means by the way that housing prices are starting to come down as a result because if someone is paying overall more for financing the house then what's got to give in many cases it's the home prices and the demand that we have seen also has been falling to some extent. Yeah, it continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers here. Freddie Mac also noting that they're going to make some enhancements to their market survey really improving and looking at some of the collection quality diversity of data use. It seems like kind of mirroring what we had seen from ADP earlier. This year over the summer this is a time to really get a better sense of how accurate the data still is and still as of right now for some of these rates it does still point to what we all expected and still some home buyers are experiencing is the higher rates that they're having to pay for an extended period of time which is kind of barring out. And it's just the average if your credit isn't up to snuff right. You're paying way more than this. Maybe last year at this point if your credit wasn't good what maybe you pay five or six percent now what do you eight nine ten. One thing to point out is people do refinance. They're mortgages right. So if rates do if you buy a house at this rate and then rates go down then you can many people can then refinance. So that is one little.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,4,2022-10-06 14:06:50
2686," So if you buy a house at this rate and then rates go down, then many people can then refinance. So that is one little more positive tone here. All right, let's talk about the implications of all of this and the implications of higher rates on the economy overall. For that we bring in Kenneth Rogoff. He is Professor of Economics at Harvard University. He's joining us now, Ken. Thank you so much for being here, first of all. Here is sort of a very visible real world impact of Fed policy, right? The rate increase that we have seen in mortgages specifically and the effect that the knock on effect that has on the housing market. What do you think overall about the effectiveness of Fed policy with fighting this current bout of inflation? Well, we haven't had them fight about of inflation in a very long time. So whatever models we had, we have to dust off and see. I think we know that their long lack of facts, yeah, it hits the markets very quickly. It's equity markets, more slowly, housing markets, but things like employment, the peak effects can be a year off. So it's very hard. It's one of the things that makes it so hard for the Fed to get to a soft or soft-ish landing, which I'm pretty skeptical about. Okay, and so with your skepticism about getting to a soft-ish landing, what would the reality of the economic detriment incurred be if we were to see what many economists are calling for a recession in mid-2023? Well, I mean, I think it could be pretty brutal if the Fed really is hell-bent on having inflation come down as quickly as possible to two or two and a half percent. We have Europe very likely going to recession China. It leads to growth recession by all measures for the Amor recession. That's a lot of pressures on us, the dollar is very strong. And interest rates are rising very fast. So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession if that would be lucky. I'd say it could be a tough trade-off for the Fed once the numbers start setting in. I'm a little worried that having gone the wrong way in one direction with the change in their framework and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation, they're now going in the other direction and possibly moving too fast given the long legs. Professor, if the economy does get brutal, like you just suggested, do you think this is a Federal Reserve at some point next year that is back to unwinding these aggressive rate hikes they've been taking recently? So here's the thing. Yes, but I think where we're going to land at the end of this and now I'm looking maybe two years ahead is that a level of interest rates higher than we're used to even after inflation comes down. The real interest rate, the premium of the interest rate over the inflation rates, been extraordinarily low since the financial crisis. Some people say it's secular stagnation, demographic, low productivity inequality, what have you. I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact it was abnormally low in that period and we're going to get some moving back to being meaning that interest rates even when they start coming down, they not come down all that much. So how do we then determine what the sort of natural or stable rate should be, right? Is there any way of sort of gaming that out what that could look like? Very tough. My own research sort of speaks to the 10-year rate which I think will end up in a higher place than we've been used to before the pandemic. But what's going on with the Fed funds rate with all the regulation and the financial repression is a little hard to say. So they really have no idea that's one of the things that's making it difficult. But if you're asking, I think it'll be higher than we're used to. For consumers right now, what should they be navigating? How can they best navigate perhaps even leading into the scenario that you've described? I mean, it's a tough picture. We're probably...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,5,2022-10-06 14:10:44
2687," perhaps even leading into the scenario that you've described. Well, I mean, it's a tough picture where probably headed towards a, you know, difficult situation coming out of a difficult situation. Certainly, I think employment is the key. Everybody's been particularly young people can moving jobs, you know, every six months or a year. They better think twice about that in this period when it might not be so easy to land on another job. Can I want to switch gears a little bit because you focus not just on the US, but on the globe as well. And you and some others are just out with some really interesting research on the real estate market in China. Now, so much, there's been so much attention on the sort of zero COVID policy and the negative effect that's having on China. But there's some underlying risk here that you illustrate in this research. We're looking now, you look at so-called tier three Chinese cities, some of the smaller cities, although still pretty large, and that there's this excessive housing stock and that there's been really a sharp slowdown in prices and housing prices in those areas. What kind of risk is this presenting for the Chinese economy? Well, I think it's a huge long-term problem with or without the zero COVID policy. Housing, real estate, more generally, commercial real estate infrastructure has been the go-to policy for China. I did some research a couple of years ago, peak China housing, showing all the factors that suggested we really have come to an end of it. And more recently, my co-author and I've shown that a lot of that is concentrated in the more hidden tier three cities, the Cincinnati's of China, so to speak. But they out, let me say the Cincinnati's of China could be five and ten million people, maybe since the United States of few hundred thousand, and on top of that, there are a lot of them. They account for 60% of GDP. You don't see it that people travel to the big cities, they're less visible, but they have, they really have a problem where they've been building like crazy and are sort of getting to the end of the line of that development strategy, and it's not that easy for them to pivot. And so what then happens when we do see China coming out of zero COVID, at the same time that the rest of the globe is slowing down or even entering recession. I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe? China's been enormously important for the rest of the globe. It's counted for, I don't know, like a quarter of all global growth over the decade before the pandemic may be going into the first year, at least according to the IMF, and those days are over. I think we're looking at much slower growth in China, who knows what the real numbers are, but much slower growth in China for years to come. And of course, it matters. I mean, it hits commodity exporters, the hardest, that they have a raracious appetite for commodities, but European luxury car makers, et cetera. I think it's going to have a very big effect. And that's even without the Ukraine war and whatever happens there and which side China ends up on. Can we go off, Professor of Economics at Harvard University. Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations, all of it, great conversation. Guys, let's get to the Iowa finances and that's for over at the Wi-Fi Interactive with a look at what's taking place here on the day and that is what we're tracking. And you guys were just talking about those markets, right? And just looking at the home builders, we did see a little bit of action here with some of these home builders that had been in green territory. Now losing some of that steam, I just want to also pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see how much these home builders have lost year-to-date. Looking at the sector action, we are seeing the markets down right now, so you're looking at utilities and also real estate, which are moving to the downside. You've got energy, though, that is still in green territory. And over on the NASDAQ 100, some of these mega caps that had been in green earlier are now a bit under pressure in video had been more than 1% earlier now losing some steam. Also looking at some of what's happening with our trending tickers because we've got two trending tickers that we should mention on our trending ticker page. Well, that's the oil right now, but you can see also the US dollar index by the way going a little bit higher that is putting pressure on stocks.

2688," that we should mention on our turning ticker page. Well, that's the oil right now. But you can see also the US dollar index by the way going a little bit higher. That is putting pressure on stocks. And on those trending, we are seeing Pinterest that's trending right now. Number one on our Yahoo Finance page. That's after that Goldman call. But also want to check out Costco because Costco's September sales came in higher than expected. So you're looking at those sales that increasing for Costco. And the stock right now up more than 1% year to date also outperforming the broader markets because that's chewy. But you're today Costco down 14% still outperforming the broader markets. You can tell consumers still want to get value big bulk. They love Costco. I love those hot dogs and as for a thanks for saving me to appreciate it because we're here before we had to break. You saw on that board, a nice highlight of chewy. Let's put a spotlight on the impressive wheat so far for shares of chewy. Sock is up close to 20% on the week. We're seeing it add to gains a little bit here on the early going. Dusting the Nasdaq Composites 5.5% gain. The online pet retailer, Stock, got a big boost on Wednesday, especially into the close as data from investment research out that Yippet found chewy sales trending above expectations for the current quarter. We will note that chewy in late August slashes full of your sales outlook by a couple hundred million dollars in stock. Got absolutely clobbered. Coming up. Sorry, I was just going to say I just bought some handouts. It's really so good. Amazon versus chewy. Alright, let's take that discussion off on a very interesting topic. Alright, coming up. Supply chain rows are trickling down to the price of Ford's hot selling electric pickup truck, the F-150, Julie's back with the latest business headlines. On the other side of the road. Let's get down to business now with some other headlines. We're watching Uber's former security chief, Joseph Sullivan, has been found guilty of obstruct.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,7,2022-10-06 14:20:01
2689," Let's get down to business now with some other headlines we're watching. Uber's former security chief Joseph Sullivan has been found guilty of obstructing an FTC probe for failing to report a 2016 data breach to authorities. Prosecutor said he took steps to cover up the incident, classifying the hack as a bug bounty rather than a data breach. Sullivan's legal team said that after the hacker signed non-disclosure agreements, the security chief felt the incident did not need to be reported. The Sullivan now faces a five-year prison sentence for obstruction, and up to three years for failing to report a felony. That data breach, by the way, occurred during Travis Kalinick's term as CEO, where top performers were often given a blind eye. Meanwhile, General Electric is restructuring the company laying off workers at his offshore wind unit as it grapples with weak demand, rising costs, and supply chain delays according to reports. The cuts are expected to affect 20% of the offshore wind unit's US workforce, which equates to hundreds of workers. Wind has been GE's largest and most profitable renewable business, but the expiry of renewable energy tax credits took a big toll on demand. And Ford is raising the price again for its electric F-150 lightning pickup truck. The second time in the last couple months, the chief is versioned. Now retails were just under $52,000, that's a roughly 30% increase from the original starting price of about $40,000 with first-win on sale in May. Ford said in his statement, the increase is on the result of ongoing supply chain constraints, rising material costs, and other market factors. So as. Fitter shares continue to trade below Elon Musk's $54.20 offer price, as there is still fears on a deal getting done. Let's get more on this with City's Senior Alistair, Ron Josie, Ron. Good to see you here, just based on your knowledge of the situation, folks, you have talked to, do you still think this deal gets done at that price? You know, we were pretty, the big news this week was around coming together, both parties suggesting with Elon saying we will honor our original $54.20 share offer and Twitter come out, coming out specifically and saying that it's something that we are looking to do as well. So the fact that they are both negotiating table, not in court going against each other, I think that's a positive step. And it seems to me, it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be made to Twitter and when that would actually take place, even if and as this does kind of continue to work its way through? Yeah, I mean, if something were to happen, meaning that if it is acquired by Mr. Musk and if we go through and it's a now private company, look, unfortunately this has been in the public world now that this acquisition back in force and call it March or April, I believe, with the initial deal initial offer there. And so Twitter has gone through quite a bit of change from then until now, not only from a business perspective with advertisers potentially pulling back, maybe getting a little bit more nervous, some placing ads on Twitter, in addition to the macro changes that are happening out there, but then internally, there's just a lot of concern in our view around morale, around basically attrition or just getting things done in new products being launched. So your question of how long would it take to sort of get the business back up to speed? Frankly, it would take probably some time to rebuild and the macro environment would not help in the current environment where advertising continues to be a little bit of a software subject overall. And Ron, we don't even know what he's going to do with the company, right? I have to say, man, it must be tough analyzing this company right now. You didn't know if the deal was going to get done. You don't know what Elon's going to do if he does indeed consummate the deal, right? I mean, we've gotten some hints dropped. There's been a lot of speculation. Trump's going to come back. He's talked about this, everything app X, whatever. But like, how do you, how do you even model concretely in a situation like this? Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company. So you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself to model and figure out what's next. But you essentially have to rebuild the business, right? So you start, I'm sure the first my order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the same thing. If your business is veryать that you will be able to live in depressed memories. See, you continue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,8,2022-10-06 14:24:12
2690," So you start, I'm sure the first my order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the service onboarding with something that was a big focus prior to this saga that we're incurring currently. And so number one would be product. Number two then is figuring out how you best monetize. And right now the model is primarily advertising. But of course, there's options around subscription. There's options around maybe payments or something along those lines purchases. So there's different things you can do. But I think day one, whenever this comes to a conclusion has to be let's focus on the product. Let's make sure it becomes that, call it town square, open free marketplace, and then everything else should follow. But it's not something that I think happens overnight. It's likely to take some time. Ron, is there an appetite in the marketplace for this super app concept that Elon is pushing here? Do consumers want to, let's say, go into Twitter, tweet, then also maybe get taken to trade some stocks on XYZ platform, and then order an Uber, and then a hamburger for dinner. I mean, do people really want that? Yeah, it's interesting. The super apps here in the West haven't really taken on as much as they have, taken off as much as they have over in Asia and other parts of the world. And so that definitely is a TBD overall. Partnerships to allow things along those lines that would build off of what you see on Twitter make sense. You can see that happening. But one super app, it's a change in use case, right? And the thing with Twitter that haven't covered the company for a while now, and looking at it quarter in, quarter out, the number one thing is a product, be those monetizable daily active users. And so the more you can do to get those users on board, everybody knows Twitter. What's always surprising is you would think it would have a bigger footprint overall. And so that's the in terms of users. And so that's probably the job number one. And if the super app does that, that's a big question. But frankly, it's still too early to even offer that. And I think you're right, it would have to be something that would at least be in line to what you are looking for and consuming while on Twitter. And there's partnerships that can make that happen. But it's definitely, I would say, the product is that that's on the roadmap for down the road. Once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all of the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes a media company? And I mean, a media company with partnerships that can actually charge people for the ability to watch video content, whether that be from the WMBA, whether that be live sports, or the partnerships with even some of the entertainment companies that they've worked with over the past, creating kind of a charging premise based on that, where the social connectivity just becomes an extra add-on on top of that. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do with the platform when you have as many monetized, well, DAUs that are out there. I would say, and we've always talked about the content on Twitter is amongst the best out there. And the content is really just an amalgamation of what people are saying and doing and tweeting and whatnot. And you can get lost in Twitter for hours, challenges, that product, providing those details on what you're looking for, going more in a media strategy, working with providers and partners. We've seen success in that, right? And I think Twitter in the past has had partnerships by providing videos and highlights from the Olympics, from the NFL, from many different sports teams, as well as award shows and whatnot. So I think going down the media path is something that would continue. The question is, the model changes from primarily advertising to maybe some sort of subscription that's a TBD. And I would say most entertainment companies on the web that have gone the paying for content, it's not an easy sort of chasm or bridge to cross. And so you really need to provide that value to get users to subscribe to it. And right now, again, Twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level.

I don't know. We'll find some other good stocks to talk about with you, though. Thanks so much for coming on. Cities, senior analysts, Ron, Josie. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me. Thanks. Coming up, Europe's natural gas crisis and focus as the E remains divided on how to tackle rising energy prices will have the latest on the other side. This morning, Swedish investigators confirmed suspicions of many saying that the recent leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to the EU were caused by detonations. Now they don't say who was responsible for those detonations, but nonetheless, they say the preliminary investigation has, quote, strengthened the suspicions of serious sabotage. Let's talk about the natural gas dynamics in that area and indeed around the globe. For that, we're joined by Goldman Sachs, head of natural gas research. That is Samantha Dart. Samantha, it's good to see you again. So we got this report this morning. I, again, it sort of confirms what a lot of folks had suspected. I don't know if it changes in your mind the calculation, the risks to supply knowing indeed that it was detonations that caused those leaks. It doesn't really. We already expected it. I think this is pretty much consensus that Nord Stream 1 or Nord Stream 2 for that matter would not flow gas to Nord Stream 2. Not only now, but going into next year as well. So our northwest shear and gas balance is remained the same. Okay. And so, I mean, for those of us who are still trying to admittedly wrap our heads around this fully, I mean, the price impact that this would have towards the end users, the end consumers of this natural gas as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,10,2022-10-06 14:32:12
2692," trying to admittedly wrap our heads around this fully. I mean, the price impact that this would have towards the end-users, the end-consumers of this natural gas as well. Yeah, so what the region is having to deal with is a massive lack of supply, right? This has been already established since the close from Russia have been curtailed and increasingly curtailed over the course of this year. As a result, we have seen prices skyrocket to 10 times or more of their 10-year average and we expect them to remain elevated going forward. Now sequentially, it's a bit tricky because over the course of the winter, actually if winter temperatures are close to average, we expect prices to drop a little bit and bring a little bit of relief because you have enough storage to deal with that deficit. Now going into next summer, yes, we still expect extremely elevated prices over 230 euros summer next year. Samantha, your colleagues over on the oil side of the equation raised their forecast for brand, I know. If oil prices start to trend back up higher, will we see an uptick in natural gas demand or is that demand just kind of firmly capped by the price action we've seen on that side? So you're right that under this surprisingly bullish op-ed cut that has been announced, the balance for oil looks even tighter and as our colleagues highlighted, you still have the risk of potentially a $30 per barrel spike to oil prices from here. Now even taking that into account, natural gas is still so expensive that it would continue to provide an incentive for users to substitute actually away from that, and into oil. So one interesting anecdote that we've been seeing, especially going into this winter, is that now this gas to oil substitution is not even just about the power generation sector, but it's also happening starting to happen in the industrial sector where some users, instead of buying incredibly expensive natural gas, they're opting for using oil in their boilers instead. Samantha, if we do in fact go into a more prolonged recession or economic slowdown, where do you see prices for natural gas going? So the interesting thing about this slowdown that we are seeing, especially in Europe, is that it's being caused by the lack of natural gas. So think about it this way. We don't have the normal supply of natural gas. So the only way to manage storage, the only way to guarantee that we're not going to face blackouts in the winter, is to curtail demand. So this is why prices have been so elevated. And as a result, yes, we're seeing aluminum producers cutting back, fertilizer producers, gas, I'm sorry, cement, glass refineries. So industrial activity is indeed slowing and bringing Europe into a recession because of the lack of natural gas. So this is what needs to happen until this deficit in gas is resolved. Goldman Sachs head of natural gas research, Samantha Dart, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Coming up, Guggenheim is calling this company its best idea into 2023. We'll break down a few analyst calls today. Don't go anywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,11,2022-10-06 14:36:24
2693," The Now time for our call for the day. Despite Nike's inventory lows and margin pressure, Guggenheim is feeling good about the sneaker giant. The investment bank is maintaining its $135 price target and by rating on the Athlete's Leisure Maker calling it its best idea into 2023 or another way of looking best. They're saying, just do it. I'm so excited. But it's an amazing achievement. I'll try to bring this back. So interesting note by Guggenheim. I love Olympic fanat Robert Derbels work. He actually notes the top of this report that he's been covering the company for about 20 years. It feels like I've been following him for 20 years. But he does note that while profits are under pressure, he does still like Nike's brand equity. It likes its scale around the world. It likes its structural advantage in terms of its supply chain. And he goes on to say, again, some pretty cool charts that, yes, Brad, you wear Nike's? Not today. I saw the eyes move down. But Derbels also notes that we would note that Nike has a history of quick operating margin recovery from steep macro-driven drops. And we might be looking, I think investors might be looking for that to happen very, very soon. I'm wearing a brand today that was formerly owned by Nike. They divested from Cole Han. Not before making them really revolutionary, at least with the different souls that Cole Han would use in the lunar lawn from Nike. But again, I mean, this is really just kind of leaning into that brand equity that Nike has. And we were actually tossing around some of the stats that Julie was pulling earlier before the show, 22 out of the past 25 years. Nike has beat the S&P 500 performance here. And so you continue to think about what the brand has done over that time, whether it's some of the different acquisitions, making strategic decisions to get out of certain sports or at least equipment making in some sports. That's really led to the company being able to financially put those dollars that capital to work elsewhere. And the cultural partnerships that they've been able to make over time as well, they keep them in the spotlight. I just bought a new pair of sneakers. Yeah, which one? Did not buy Nike's. Really? I bought Sockinis. I tried on a pair of Nike. I tried on a pair of Sockinis. Good running shoe. It's not for running this. It's just for cash, for comfortable. It happened to your retro Reeboks. No, go ahead and pull it up. When your lift rang, it's normal for you to perform utility quality software in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,12,2022-10-06 14:41:34
2694," You tried on a pair of Nike? Very good though. I tried on a pair of sock and ease. Good running shoe. It's not for running this. It's just for cash, for comfortable. What happened to your retro Reeboks? No, go ahead and pull it. I didn't then, not yet. Not yet. I'm still thinking about. I'm still thinking, I'm still. Okay. Percolating. We got one 60 bucks. Just do it. Let's do it. Bye now. All right. We're going to continue to track shares of Nike here on throughout the rest of the day on that. But also, keeping close tabs on shares of Pinterest here today, take your simple P.I.N.S. Up 3.6% today. This is this morning after Goldman Sachs, analysts Eric Sheridan gave the company an upgrade to buy from neutral, raise the price target to $31 per share, saying that he left a recent meeting with senior Pinterest management with increased confidence here. There were a few things that were called out as a part of this. One of them, according to the analysts, companies, leaders are focused on monetizing its platform, working to raise the amount of inventory that users can purchase and making that more shoppable, which is what we continue to talk about. A good social media company, even if Pinterest doesn't want to be called a social media company, let's be real here. It's going to come back to the e-commerce, the shop ability of a platform that is so directly annexed to this idea of its users coming there and finding inspiration or inspiration, if you will. As long as users aren't flocking to another platform or getting taught by TikTok, how to do something, and then having a purchase decision that gets triggered from there, then Pinterest perhaps can maintain some of that fanfare among its new consumers, and that triggering a better average revenue per user on the site too. I like this note, and one reason why I like it is because I was at that Goldman Sachs conference. I saw Eric working in the room, and I saw the Pinterest team there. So this is a very thorough, I think, well thought out report by Eric Sheridan, who came on with us at the event, talked a lot about the headwinds that tech is facing right now, but there's a lot of expectations now built into Pinterest, and I think a lot of that rests on New CEO Bill Ready, delivering against some of these expectations, and I would just caution investors that it might take a couple quarters to see his vision play out on the top and bottom lines of Pinterest. Those shares are actually downless this year than I would have expected. All right, let's talk about, and speaking of shares that have been going down, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan upgrading the stock from underweight to neutral setting, a positive impact from the Lenders reported restructuring plan. You can see the shares are bouncing a little bit today. They're up just about 1% in US trading, that is. Of course, they also trade in their native Switzerland, and JP Morgan, it's a pretty wonky node here, but basically they're outlining two scenarios. In the first scenario, a dramatic restructuring of the bank with a 70% shrink in its investment banking operations and exit from fixed income commodities and currency trading and equities trading. So that would indeed be a big change in that scenario. Their tier one capital ratio would actually stay the same according to JP Morgan. In the second scenario, they assume yet another half-hearted investment bank restructuring, and they seem to be a little bit less positive on that particular scenario. So still some scenarios for Credit Suisse to sort of pull through this without needing to raise additional capital. I guess it's kind of the bottom line here by selling shares. This is a good bedtime read. The Niki guy died, right? They'll just do okay. All right, before we get... Giving people information. Well, you know what, here's the thing. Niki is then great. Pinterest, maybe they'll do better, and Credit Suisse will see what they do. Guys, coming up on the other side of this short break. We've got our, well, we've got much more here on Yahoo Finance, including, well, we don't have the fan who caught Aaron Judges' 60-second home on ball, but guess what? He's fielding offers upwards of $2 million. We've got more on the other side. Thank you. key. key. option Thanks",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,13,2022-10-06 14:46:18
2695," Djz Slava, the base. Time for Cup for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. People still want their Costco hot dogs and bulk groceries despite rising prices. The Costco reported another strong month of sales. For September with net sales up 80 or 8.5%. 80.5% year over year. This despite same store sales dipping on lower gas prices. All right. You're taking a look at some of the comps up 8.5% year over year for Costco. People still want it. You love it. I love it. I will refrain from saying something funny on the hot dog. When you're looking at the prices, it's a good deal to see prices decelerate in September vs. August. That inflation in a lot of these daily categories, like Costco grocery stores, you name it. It's starting to roll over over a little bit. And that's a good thing for consumers spending into the holidays. I think they recently said that they're not going to raise their membership price yet. You're predicting one that was made. It's coming this year. Yes, yes. On the gold. It's not coming this year. It waited me the last minute, but it's going to be a big earnings driver for that company. And I mean comparatively, Costco, BJs, Sam's Club underneath of Walmart, all of them had been trying to cozy up to the consumer, especially in the bulk buying boom that would seem to be. Indeed. All right. Uber is reviving itself driving vehicle plan after selling its autonomous driving research division. Uber signed a 10 year deal with an emotional to add self driving cars to its vehicle lineup. The self driving cars would work for both Uber and Uber Eats and several US cities upon launch. Still no details on where, where that will be. And I recently saw some of my first self driving cars out in San Francisco. I know some, you know, going to New York going to another place. And I think it was a Zooks. I can't see how these are the future. I still have a driver behind them. And I still ordered Uber. I didn't order a Zooks, but they look cool. That's all you got for me. Yeah. It seems like it's really early stage. I mean, regulations, like nothing is there yet. I've interviewed the CEO of Zooks and the founder of Zooks before. And of course, all of those companies that you kind of lumped together there between Zooks, between Waymo and then even for Uber and some of their driverless technology. It's all going to be dependent upon how well they're also able to license that out to some other companies that want to take advantage of it in the future too. Again, a lot of reds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,15,2022-10-06 14:53:00
2696," For Uber and some of their driverless technology, it's all going to be dependent upon how well they're also able to license that out to some other companies that want to take advantage of it in the future too. But again, a lot of red tape that they've got to get through and then additionally when you think of the customer and how this is going to be able to cut down cost for the customer as well as the company, operating cost per mile, north of a dollar, this could perhaps bring it below 40 cents. All right, and a big payday for the lucky baseball fan who caught Aaron Judges, that Aaron Judges ball, the ball estimated to bring in $2 million at auction. As of now, the Dallas-based man that caught the ball has not decided what he wants to do with it. He could give it back to Judge and the Yankees where he could sell it himself. Another unknown is taxes. The IRS has yet to come in but some experts speculate catching the ball could count is a taxable... Isn't this guy a millionaire? That's what I was told by our team. I don't know anything about him. Oh good for him. So then is it a capital gains tax because you paint for the... Sounds like he could afford it. To go to the game and then now your return on that is you actually get a good bet off. I mean, I just think it's fascinating that the regulations are such that when you catch a ball it becomes your property and one of our producers, Connor Hickey, was explaining to us it's written on purpose that way because it absolves them of liability if you are injured by a ball. I think I think... I think flying, right? Whether it's a bat or a ball or whatever it may be. I think Conor owns a lot of Mickey Mantle rookie cards so he's sitting on that goal. He knows a lot about this. Alright guys coming up next we're going to talk a little Tesla. Stick around. Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla, T-S-L-A. Yeah, they are moving lower on the day right now by the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,15,2022-10-06 14:54:28
2697," Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla, T-S-L-A. Yeah, they are moving lower on the day right now by about 1.2 percent. Questions have swirled around the tech-tightened sales of Tesla shares to finance is deal-making coupled with whether he might be too distracted to hit targets at Tesla. Craig Irwin, Roth Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst joins us now. Craig, you have a neutral rating and a $250 price target on Tesla. Now that we got that out of the way, help us answer some of these questions here. First and foremost, is Elon Musk too distracted to run both Twitter and Tesla? And what does that mean for Tesla? Just one point for regulatory reasons. The split-adjusted price target is 85. The last printed note is pre-split. So is Elon Musk too distracted to run Tesla? Frankly, Tesla is his baby. This company is a great expression of his personality. And he has shown tremendous capability to manage many different things, neuralink, the boring company, SpaceX, and other outside ventures. And the intellectual curiosity necessary to execute pretty well there. So will it possibly take time away from Tesla? Yes. I think the question that probably needs to be asked is, will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And I'm not the best judge of that. I think he already has some pretty clear ideas on Twitter. And he does have a history with PayPal and the digital payments space, which I think is part of his vision on fixing that asset. So it doesn't bother me for Tesla. I have other reasons that I'm very bearish on the company, but I have tremendous respect for what they've done. Well, we'll get to those reasons in a second, Craig. But does it even matter if Elon is distracted? Who cares? And I mentioned that because we have EV tax credits in play that are probably going to be a big tailwind to Tesla. And then we have cars that people just really seem to be obsessed about. Yeah, I mean, they've done each tremendous job, right? They've basically made the automotive industry sexy again. The last time it was sexy was the 1950s. That was when it's a come out of the best universities in the world and say, oh my gosh, I want to work for a car company. Now, those same kids are coming out and saying, I want to work on electric vehicles. The work on future drivetrain technologies, Elon Musk deserves a lot of that credit, because it's his vision and his commitment that's allowed that to take place. Does it really matter for Tesla so much? Not really. The flywheel is rolling. It's running. And they have very different issues to manage through over the next couple of years. Then what they've had to challenge through to date. And whether or not Elon Musk is the one that's the right person to make those decisions, we'll find out. I'm skeptical. I think there's some very challenging things ahead for this company. If Musk is maybe reducing his intensity with the company, it might not be a bad thing. Craig, I know there's no imminent changes at the top of Tesla, but is there anybody else there who could run the thing besides him? Oh gosh, that's a tough question. I don't think so. I've talked to a lot of former Tesla executives. I know people that have turned down positions at Tesla that are leaders. They're respect to various. It's a difficult company to work at because Elon Musk is an unreasonable person. Not in a bad way, but in a motivating way where he doesn't take no for answer. He wants to learn what you got wrong, why you got it wrong, how you're going to do a different to achieve the goal. So yes or no, yes, we got it. No, we didn't. A lot of people aren't well cool to work in that environment. There's a lot of burnout and a lot of turnover as people like to talk about for Tesla with heavy, heavy departures over here. Craig, I only got 30 seconds here. Colder months. They're coming soon. China and Tesla production. That's going to remain one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns.

2698," one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns as it doesn't seem China is going to change their zero COVID policy anytime soon. Yeah, China's China's going to be tough for them. That's going to determine whether or not they make their numbers this year, 20,000 20,000 unit months or 19,000 unit months. China, right. I don't think this is what's the biggest issue for the company. The biggest issue is competition and alternative equity is like Porsche and the upcoming Ford spin off large well established properties that are executing well. You have other examples of some of the SPAC IPOs that are actually showing success. Test has big problems on the horizon as far as this competitive environment and they don't really have the technology lead that many many people claim everybody has access this same gender base. Imagine that competition for Tesla Craig. Thank you so much Craig Irwin Rothkopf little partner senior research analyst appreciate your time this morning. Thank you. Thank you. And one final check on the market before you leave you as we see Twitter shares a little bit weaker here today.

2699, Welcome to Yahoo Finance. It's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Blickery and here's what I am watching. Stocks dip as yields take higher amid uncertainty over the path of inflation. Tomorrow's jobs report is a main event and we'll talk market positioning with Black Rocks way Lee in a minute. Goldman Sachs by the way stays bullish on oil raising its crude forecast to $110 a barrel. That's an aftermath of this OPEC plus decision. Joe Biden's his move cut move was cut was shortsighted and we'll see if the energy world's Dan Dicker agrees with us and investors wait for progress on the newly revived discussion between Twitter and Elon Musk. We look at the chance of a deal and the flow of information if we get one. But first let's take a quick look at the markets we see the Dow under a little bit of pressure down about 100 points the S&P 500 off about 1 quarter of a percent and then Nasdaq off just slightly and then checking in on the bond market we do see yields elevated just ever so slightly in the looks like the 5 10 and also 30 year tenor and with all eyes on tomorrow's jobs report. Let's welcome in Black Rocks global chief investment strategist way Lee and could you please give us your forecast and by the way it's great to see you here could you please give us your forecast of what you expect tomorrow because this is 1 half 50% of the feds dual mandate a lot of eyes on this report. Hi there good morning thanks for having me so in terms of the jobs report I think given how strong earlier momentans are it's possible that we could see kind of headline decrease but I would say that our focus is really solely what mainly around the participation rate because labor shortage has really contributed to this supply shaped environment. So if that starts to be alleviated certainly that would have feed through to inflationary dynamics and that would feed through to market pricing for rate hikes and also broadly risk sentiment as well. Let me ask you just generally about some of the central bank actions we've seen around the world over the last two weeks a bit of a 180 by the bank of England now buying bonds albeit for a short period of time. I think that we're seeing a lot of the same as the other banks are also the banks of the bank of Japan buying the US dollar try or excuse me buying its own currency the end trying to strengthen that versus others as well as the US dollar what are you seeing in the global effects world and what implications do you think this might have for equities especially as we consider these jobs numbers that you just explained to us. So really is the a result of this supply driven new regime that we're in whereby given the fact that inflationary pressure comes from supply bottlenecks and supply shortages then it's a lot harder for central banks to fight that their tools are primarily focused on addressing the demand side of the equation. You talked about bank of England going from announcing QT to start buying bonds obviously there are specific kind of fiscal development in the UK that led to the the bond buying but more broadly it just goes to show how difficult it is for a central bank decision making in this supply driven environment characterised by tougher trade offs and you also talked about bank of Japan and more broadly. So I think it's a totally policy development and currency as well I will make one observation so far this year depending on where you are based depending on which currency you are denominated your experience of the global market returns can be vastly vastly different right part of that is the dollar strength but it's more than that as well so dollar in a near term is very much driven by rate differential as well as global risk on and risk of sentiment so far has been very very strong. But given the fact that how much currencies are contributing to the experience of investors of the global markets we think that is actually really important when we think about our allocation to consider where our investors and clients are based in which is why we're rolling out regional our allocation so for example I am sitting here in the UK.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,18,2022-10-06 15:06:46
2700," where our investors and clients are based in, which is why we're rolling out regional asset locations. So for example, I am sitting here in the UK, and we recently wrote out Euro asset location views. So really from the perspective of Euro-denominated investors, how their asset location could look like versus a dollar denominated investors. And that is critical. Being local is critical in the context of the elevated macro uncertainty and elevated currency volatility. Yeah, call it part for the course versus, I guess based on this trend of deglobalization that we've seen over the last five plus years. Now, I want to talk a little bit more generally about the, we saw the US dollar strength in versus most currencies quite considerably. It's backed off of that. And the other part of the equation there is with an easing US dollar in the short term, we're seeing a bid for commodities. Now, we've been talking a lot about OPEC plus and oil, but I want to focus on silver, gold, and some of the other commodities that we've recently catch a bid. A lot of people have either been waiting for gold to catch a bid or have just counted it out entirely. What do you think of the precious metal complex right now? Well, exactly as you framed the correlation between the dollar and precious metal has been in place. And I think in that context as dollar, we can, you talked about how the risk on the sentiment earlier in the week led to a weaker dollar. It has been somewhat supportive of commodities and precious metals for that matter. But I would broadly say though the importance of diversification cannot be overstated in the context of the world that we're entering into. So thinking about the macro environment, we're currently expecting a recession. This year in Europe, in the UK, and next year in the US. And at the same time, risks of central banks over tightening policies into restrictive territories in order to fight inflation. The risks of that have risen significantly. Recently, but also certainly versus beginning of the year. So in this kind of environment where it makes sense to be more prudent when it comes to our location, when it comes to portfolio taking, than having diversification in portfolio makes sense and certainly go to play the role in that. And I think that is also part of the considerations behind recent price action. We got a time for one more, a bit brief here. But I want to talk to you about the Chinese UN and also policy makers there. We've seen the UN strengthen against the Japanese yen about 12% year to date. Yen has considered, has weakened considerably. And I talked about the measures by the BOJ before. Do you think the PBOC intervenes to in the in the in the in the Yuan here? And what consequences would that have for global risk assets? Well, I think more broadly when we talk about the Chinese Yuan, we also have to talk about the Chinese economy. Right? So what has happened so far this year is that there has been significant headwind for Chinese economy from the perspective of the zero-covid policy acting as a dampener to economic reopening momentum and at the same time previously the Chinese economy was supported by the tailwind of global export. Like when the rest of the world was in shutdown, the export from China and the demand for that has added to strong momentum last year. But now the rest of the world is switching back on and China is in zero-covid mode. So that export tailwind is is is fading away as well as the the China economy is in a way as well. And both of their act as headwind and challenges for Chinese economy this year and the Chinese currency movement so far this year are reflection of that. You talked about versus the yen but also versus the dollar of the dollar story is beyond more than just Chinese Chinese Yuan. I would say one thing though as we kind of had into next year, some expectation needs to be big deal around the restart momentum obviously a lot contingent on how the COVID policy would evolve. But in the same way that the US economy opened up with strong momentum, your PM economy opened up with strong momentum in such an expect higher growth levels next year versus 2022. Surprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,19,2022-10-06 15:11:23
2701," went up with strong momentum, your PM economy, opened up with strong momentum in such an exact higher growth levels next year versus 2022. So, please say lots of moving parts here. Really appreciate your insights. As always, Waili, BlackRock, Global Investment, Chief Strategist, thank you for your time. And we're keeping an eye on oil prices as well. This morning following a big move by OPEC Plus to slash output by two million barrels a day beginning in November, exceeding market expectations and incurring the wrath of the Biden White House for more on this. Let's welcome in, Yahoo, finances in S for A. And we got a little bit of a surprise yesterday. And as we've been talking about, now OPEC Plus has already not been able to fulfill its quotas. So they said, this is really just a cut of about one to 1.1 million barrels per day. That's still a lot of nests. Yeah, that is, it's significant. It's a significant cut. And a one takeaway is that OPEC Plus must be concerned about a worldwide recession in order to be making such a cut. Goldman Sachs came out with a forecast and updated forecast saying that oil could reach $110 a barrel in Q4, also $115 a barrel by the end of the first quarter of 2023. And if these cuts are sustained through December of 2023, then these elevated prices would remain elevated. I mean, the only thing that could bring it down is really demand destruction at this point. Now, during the financial crisis, Jared, between 2008, 2009, oil prices, those had peaked at $145. They came all the way down to $35 a barrel in five months time. Andy Lipo of Lipo Associates is saying basically that, look, they must be worried in order for them to be doing this. It also shows you that the US dollar has also been having a huge impact on these oil prices. And we've also seen some rubblings or heard them that the Biden White House would also consider another release from this strategic petroleum reserve that's the SPR. We saw that take a place and be in effect earlier this year. I think those purchases or those releases have now concluded, but what about the possible effects of any new releases from the SPR? Yeah, well, certainly that would have a short term effect. Like we've seen with gasoline prices, as we've seen those gasoline prices coming lower. But one interesting point also about this OPEC plus decision is it kind of also shows you the waning influence of the US, because this is as much as it is about demand and supply as it is also political in a way as well. And the sort of relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the sort of waning influence that the US is having on the cartel as well. Yeah, and I'd add the most important influence the US has on the cartel is the fact that WTI, and most global oil, is quoted in US dollars. So a huge investment, I would guess you would say, to protect right there. Thank you for that. Yeah, who finances in that for it? All right, our trending ticker of the day is Pinterest. It is surging 45% after Goldman Sachs upgraded and stopped to buy from Newfoundland, raised its price target to $31 from $24. Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan likes the improvements in user growth and engagement, as well as the potential for revenue growth and operating margin into next year in 2024. Monetization is a key area that Goldman also likes with the prospect for the social media company increasing its share of ad spending, and that says companies cut budgets and expenses and coming up. You're going to want to take a look at this. Talking cyclical stocks, the ride continues, love that plan continues for Peloton as a pandemic era, darling announces 500 more job cuts. We're about 12% of its workforce. Will the struggling group find its feet? Will we take the deep dive next?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,20,2022-10-06 15:17:10
2702,"'' Welcome back. Peloton laying off a large number of its employees. The new CEO of Berri McCarthy, who is looking to cut costs and make sure that in this environment where the company is trying to create more partnerships on the wholesale front, see more of their cash and capital be put towards actually being able to continue production but also the right sizing of production and overall just the structure of the company that that really comes down and hits some of unfortunately the employee base. Now what we also do know is that even over the course of earlier this week they had netted some new partnerships on the wholesale front and it really kind of spells out what Berri McCarthy is looking to do is tap some of those wholesale partners look to those channels to potentially drum up even more subscribers within everything from Dick Sports all the way to your Hilton state and then eventually being able to at the same time build on the digital subscriptions the number of people that are continuing to use these connected devices but then it comes back to if he does not see the growth necessary in this next stretch of time and he's looking out to the six month period even out as far as 18 months perhaps to say whether or not Peloton has been successful at implementing some of these strangers and if it will prove to push them back to profitability as well. One at Hone and we got a brief second here on that timeline. Sure. Now he based but this is McCarthy basically gave the company six months and he did not mince words here have you ever heard a CEO of a company give a going concern risk factor to its employees basically in this context. Not one that isn't already looking at perhaps some type of bankruptcy. It would have to be imminent.

2703," a bankruptcy precedent. It would have to be imminent. Imminent threat. And what's even more noteworthy about that is whether or not they would actually be looking for a sale if they weren't able to hit some of those potential targets, because he did bring up this thought of, I don't know if we are a standalone company or a viable standalone company, just Peloton, if we're not able to hit some of these financial targets that we've set forth. He did say that this is the most optimistic that he has been, but he certainly to your point did not mince words there, and it starts to raise the question about who would buy a Peloton, especially when you've already got other stationary bikes that are being sold at Dix, that are already being sold on Amazon. So then it gets into the rest of the fitness category and the connected device category too, and it's really tough to sell on whether or not it would be a company in Apple or some other major tech company that would say, no, what? Yeah, we'll take on a connected fitness device company where they've already struggled to kind of mule-outs in new homes. There's a lot of baggage there. We'll have to see what happens, but Peak Peloton with the stock down over 90%, we'll see what comes of that. Thank you for that, Brad Smith. Thanks. And now a new game, all the kids are playing as well as Wall Street veterans, and they're raging about it. SPAC, D-SPAC, or Fold, and who better to join us with an update of this beleaguered sector is Alexander Seminova. Alex, excuse me, you've been covering this, and IPOs have done poorly this year. SPAC's much worse. What are the details? Yeah, just a terrible time for the SPAC market, such a huge turnaround from last year, and the year before, what has been called, the SPAC Renaissance Miss Chaud, saw this sharp uptick in SPAC activity, and it really a big come down this year. SPAC liquidations are on the rise with these Blaine check companies, really struggling to find targets for their deals to close so far this year. 22 special purpose acquisition companies worth about $10 billion have been liquidated, according to a weekly report by SPAC research. That's more than that. And more than half of those liquidations have occurred since August, and that's not even taking into consideration the liquidations that have been announced and haven't actually happened yet. For example, last week, Chimoth Pallia Petia set in a regulatory filing that he would liquidate to of his SPACs, also after failing to find a target and return $1.6 billion to investors, Bill Ackman also liquidated his vehicle. So it's just one after the other that is falling apart. Yeah, and I read an interesting stat yesterday that 40% of these companies, SPAC companies are issuing going concern warnings. That means they might go out of business for their investors, and that's double the IPO rate. But I want to hone in on some news today. George Soros' son, in, well, he's been part of the SPAC movement as well. And we've got some details there. You can share with us. Yes, so Bloomberg reported yesterday that the Everton Football Club spurred takeover interest from a SPAC led by George Soros is nephew that's according to people familiar with the matter. But there's no certainty yet whether the transaction will be closed, especially in this market where some deals are announced, but they don't actually follow through because the conditions are changing so rapidly. Yep, rapidly changing conditions. We've come to see this as the new norm. Yahoo, finances, Alex, Simon Overt, thank you for sharing that.

2704,"ayer. Welcome back the bold seam in control after the third quarter kicked off with a big two-day rally, but a slew of economic data ahead could alter the market optimism. And I want to get a quick check of the Wi-Fi interactive where we can see energy in the forefront today, followed by communication services, tech and consumer discretionary. Those are at the top, what you see in green. To the downside, utilities is down almost 2% followed by real estate and healthcare. All of those are defensive sectors and let's get a check of the majors now and we can see a mix board. Nasdaq, just barely in the green by seven basis points, it's been fluctuating all day and then the Dow is down about one third of a percent and the S&P 500 down one fifth of a percent. So without further ado, we want to talk about the current market action and that is with Kelly Cox, she is E-Torrell's US Investment Analyst and Kelly, always great to see you here. We've done a number of webinars together and we've talked about some of the statistics in the S&P 500 and I think you and I were looking at some of the same data this week and what were you looking at? What were some of the conclusions that you came to? Yeah, dear, we were looking at some of the same data. I mean, the rally we've seen so far this week or at least on Monday and Tuesday has been fierce, I think we can all agree on that. But it's so fierce. I mean, it's the first time the S&P has rallied 2.5 percent or more in back-to-back days since December 2008 and you and I both ran the data, right? We see these kinds of rallies either deep in their market or in the first few days after a bull market starts, which is the exact opposite to an area there, right? And it just goes to show just how complicated this environment is for investors, how just the motion fueled and panicky it feels and it's quite a tough position to be in because we could be staring down to different paths here. And so investors who are nervous right now, what is your advice to them? Hopefully everybody's sitting on piles of cash, but that's not necessarily the case. I know that I have a significant amount deployed, got some on the sidelines here ready to be deployed. What are you telling your clients right now? Yeah, well, it's interesting you say that because you've seen the sentiment and the sour moon that the market is in, I'd expect there to be more cash on the sidelines than then we think. But at the same time, we're telling our clients to really manage your emotions here, to understand where the market environment is, but also the fact that it could be very costly to miss out on the first few days of a bull market. We really like a barbell strategy here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,23,2022-10-06 15:29:29
2705," and where the market environment is, but also the fact that it could be very costly to mess out on the first few days of a bull market. We really like a barbell strategy here, holding on to some risk, but being defensive at the same time. And where do you see the market opportunities when this market finally turns around? Maybe it already has, maybe the lows in, but that's not necessarily the sure bet right now. What kind of sectors or styles are you looking at? Yeah, well, this market really is bottoming. We would expect to see more of an uptick and risk here, more of a more of a surging growth year asset here. We really like quality risk though at the moment. I mean, there are a lot of different flavors of growth stocks. We all know that with tech, you could look at the more speculative concept stocks, or you could look at big tech. We think big tech is a good example of quality risk with strong financials. And at the same time, we really like cyclicals here, but we're feeling a little more cautious at the moment only because we don't know what the future holds for us here. And if we see growth deteriorate much more, we could see that reflected in physical stocks. Hey, Kelly, I was writing our newsletter this morning, the morning brief. Actually, I wrote it yesterday afternoon for publication this morning, but it was about those very same market statistics that you were talking about. After I ran the data and I saw kind of a mixed bag there, I kind of went off on a rant. And you know, you and I love to parse the data and look for things. Sometimes we don't always find an edge. Maybe you did, maybe I didn't, but I think my message for investors is sometimes you just got to turn off the news, not Yahoo Finance, of course, while you're watching this broadcast, but you got to filter out the noise, just wondering what you're thinking about this as you also talk to some of your clients. Oh, it's so hard because it's so noisy these days and there are so many things you can look at to find that signal. And I mean, here, I do know I like parsing through data. You just said that, but I always try to remind people that when we see these big and up and down days, there's something significant happening. What that's significant to, what that moment or significance is, we're not really sure yet. And I know that's not super helpful, but you have to really remember, you know, your own goals and your own needs, especially strongly in times like this, you know, really focus on why you're investing and what kind of time horizon you have because that will help you determine which market and which voices you listen to. That's right. Focus on risk management and your timeframe. Lots of signal in that interview, not a lot of noise. Thank you for that, Kelly Cox, EToro USA investment analyst.

2706," Feeding Welcome back. Oil prices heading higher with crude oil WTI above $88 per barrel. And that's after OPEC plus's decision to cut output yesterday by 2.1 million barrels. What does this mean for the energy space? Let's bring in Dan Dicker, founder of the Energy World. We're Dan. Let me talk to you about this report here. Glad to have you always great to hear from you. This is an effective cut of a lot less than 2.1 million barrels per day because OPEC plus has not been living up to their quotas because they can't pump necessarily that much out of a lot of the countries. What is your take? And Dan, you might have to unmute yourself on the phone. We're not getting any audio at this time. Alright, it looks like we're going to have to go to break. We're going to see if we can get Dan Dicker back on the phone right after this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,25,2022-10-06 15:37:10
2707," Harlemague Welcome back. A quick check of the markets now where we see everything under a little bit of pressure. The Dow is down by 4.10% of the S&P 500 a little bit less. And the NAS deck, as I'm looking at at the Wi-Fi interactive down just seven basis points. And now a quick check of the bond market as well. We're seeing the 10 year Tino yield up about five basis points. Let me see if we can get a read on the five year here. That is up seven a little bit more. And the 30 year is up 2%. So the front end of the curve receiving a little bit of a boost there. The 13 week T bill yield about break even down just slightly from yesterday's levels. And also the dollar, the dollar after being under a little bit of pressure over the last couple weeks showing signs of strength. And that is weighing on a part of the equities complex here today. Not the energy sector. We see XLE. That's up about 1%. Followed by the mega cap sector's communication services, tech, consumer discretionary, just barely up there. All of those out performing to the downside, seeing utilities and real estate underperform each of those down about 2%. Now, anyone shopping for a new home has seen it firsthand. US home sales going hot from hot to ridiculous levels. Yahoo, finances, Danny Romero has more on how the feds inflation fighting tactics are weighing on the housing market. What are you seeing? Jared, what I've been hearing the way it's being described to me as that the housing market is being brought to its knees by the Federal Reserve. That's what a macro strategy is from bespoke investments told me yesterday. Following the drop in the mortgage demand from the associate from that we saw from the mortgage bankers association seasonal index. So yes, those higher mortgage rates are really taking a hit on the housing market and it could get worse. That macro strategist is estimating that the volume of mortgage demand could fall 10%. And not only that, but mortgage rates could peak 8%. Yes, today we did see mortgage rates dip to 6.6%. But to put this into perspective, climbing rates has added $337 to a typical monthly mortgage payment. That is according to redfin data. But again, this all goes back to the feds decision. If they continue to slow down economic activity, then we are going to see slower demand for mortgages. And so far, there's been no indication that the fed is backing off. And we also haven't had any inflation prints to show that inflation is coming down. That's right. Part of the fed strategy is to, well, not cripple the economy, but also, but hamper the economy a little bit. Unemployment has to rise. And we already, you just said that people are facing mortgage increases in their mortgage payments of about $330 somewhere in that ballpark. Is there a ray of sunshine? Where's the hope here? Yeah. So home prices have come down, but against, again, that's not really correlated to inflation. One part of the housing market that is correlated to inflation is rents. Apartment rents have come down. We saw that from July to August. But that's because people are paying so much for everything else that there's really no little wiggle wiggle room really for rents. So yes, landlords are losing their pricing power. Tenants are, they're also losing tenants as well. So yes, rents are still elevated and prices are high. They're expected to come down, but that could take some time and also it goes back to the issue of supply and demand. Yeah, with a lag and not going to help me on that lease, I just signed, but thank you for the report here. Yeah, who finances Danny Romero? Coming up next, it's a grab bag. Who knows what we're going to talk about? Yeah, who finances Danny Romero just joined us, but we have more on the other side of this break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,26,2022-10-06 15:41:43
2708," It's considered a natural礼, so we'd like to measure investment houses. Welcome back. Oil prices heading slightly higher about half a percent up and that's after OPEX plus decision to cut output. And let's talk about what this means for the energy space with Dan Dicker. He is the founder of the energy word and we have him on the phone here. Dan, always great to talk with you. The official cut was 2.1 million barrels per day but in effect it is much much less than that. Why is that? Well, basically Jared, it's because OPEX has been under producing what it has been promising the market since December of 2021 and that's only grown. I mean, you might have realized that they've been increasing their limits, their production gaps almost every month since December of 2021 but not meeting those limits and it's sort of kind of grown to the fact that now there's a shortfall between what they've been promising and what they've actually been producing of somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 million barrels a day. So it's very, from a practical point of view, it's not clear how much of a practical effect this cut will have but of course from a psychological point of view, it's enormous. I mean, this is OPEC reasserting their control of a market that has as bad as a supply problem from a global standpoint as I've ever seen in the 40 years that I've been covering oil. So if you're going to try and beat down prices as the Europeans and Biden have been trying to do with Fed, Fed rate hikes and quantitative tightening and of course releases from the SBR, you do find that OPEC had had enough and was saying, look, we've got a fundamental market here that should support prices closer to 3 digits and we don't like oil going under $80 a barrel. So they called an emergency meeting and they've made a statement here saying they're going to try and prove.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,27,2022-10-06 15:46:56
2709, support prices closer to three digits and we don't like oil going under eighty dollars about so they called an emergency meeting and they've made a statement here saying you know they're going to try and prove to uh... Biden and the europeans that this is a supply problem and not really a pro a price problem in this cli in this ties closely to the relationship between the u.s. and the Saudis i believe it was several months ago the uh... Saudis announced a one hundred uh... thousand barrel per day protection cut and i think that was an olive to the by the administration was only hours after that that by the announced that yes i'm going to meet with the saudis for the first time here uh... what is this mean for the relationship with the u.s. going forward when you have this level of disagreement yeah i mean look there's a visit by the isn't a very interesting spot and of course the Saudis are a an ally of the united states and they they they rely on the united states for military supplies as well as support not ways so uh... but there is also the other side of the story which nobody really wants to hear is that uh... Saudi Arabia is uh... you know an oil economy and at the the times when they can't get the revenues out that they feel that they deserve they they generally have to make some moves to try and protect those revenues now by the is coming up on not only on trying to uh... to uh... uh... a tackle of very bad inflation problem but he also has midterms that are coming up and high gas prices are a political nightmare so he is trying to balance again these relationships that he has with uh... middle east allies along with political needs he has as well as economic needs he has to get inflation under control and it's really it's going to be a war here between you know what the what the united states in the EU can do with much of this monetary policy that's really pushing down all sorts of risk assets including stocks but of course oil too and what the Saudis and the rest of opette can do trying to protect their market by really cutting production and adding to what's already a very deep deep supply problem and we and we got to leave it there always appreciate you stopping by and thanks for sticking around here on the phone dan dicker founder of the energy world all right while twitter shares they are up today and all looks like well they are down just slightly and that is after investors await progress on the newly revived discussions with Elon Musk the latest must and the group are reportedly delaying the billionaires long awaited deposition after his decision to proceed with the forty four billion dollar deal also admit discussions over financing writers reporting that apollo global management and six street partners who had been looking to stump up some of the money no longer are in talks polloglabel management is a parent company of yahu finance yeah who finances elixis keen and joins us now in elixis there was speculation yesterday that twitter wanted musloyer to disclose whether he reacted to an anonymous email what do we know about this yeah Jared so there was some speculation and it was about this may six email that twitter was asking the judge for more information the judge uh saying that musk might have to turn over more details on an anonymous sender that sent an email to musk's attorney alix bureau and it was thought that it might be connected to peter zatko the twitter whistleblower that has caused so much upheaval in terms of spam and bot counts and twitter security on its platform but in an affidavit to the judge today that was filed sphero said this to date i have taken no actions of any kind with respect to that may six email so kind of putting to bed that part of the speculation but as you know look at the share price today reflecting a lot of doubt still not quite leveling off to that fifty four dollar and twenty cent price that musk has now reproposed that he will close the deal there um the wall street journal reporting that the parties are going late into uh talks late wednesday still unsettled about how to move forward exactly despite the fact that musk has said in a letter that is now filed with the sec and that the court has its hand on saying that he'll go forward on those original terms but here's the problem there's some fuzzy language in that letter and what it says is it's pending musk's receipt of debt financing and what they're talking about there is the approximate twelve point five billion dollars that's coming from morgan stanley and is committed from morgan stanley uh but what's the hold up really it could be that debt fine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,28,2022-10-06 15:50:25
2710," at $12.5 billion that's coming from Morgan Stanley and is committed from Morgan Stanley. But what's the hold up really? It could be that debt financing language. It could also be possibly executive and employee compensation that needs to come out of this deal. Twitter might want some more terms around that. And also they might want indemnities to be inserted into this new re-up deal. We don't know for sure though, but let's focus back on that financing for just a minute. It was back in April on the 21st that Musk had said through his lawyers that more information on Twitter's fake accounts, those spam and bot accounts, was needed for Musk's financing. So I would think that Twitter would want to clarify that that is indeed not going to be the case if he is going to go through with this deal. Plus added to that, banks can independently assert a claim that a material adverse event has occurred. That would be a change, a major change in conditions that they could assert and say, well, that changes whether we can offer this financing to Musk. Now the lawyers that I've talked to have said that's probably not going to be the case. But we still have to wait and see here. But they do say that there's one key thing to watch for. And that is that deposition of Elon Musk that was scheduled to go forward today, but is now delayed. All these M&A lawyers that I'm in talks with, they say that certainly Twitter would want to have Musk's testimony before they go forward with any trial. The trial is still on the books, Jared, for October 17th. And we'll have to see what comes of this. And we're going to stick with the subject and pivot from legal battles. And thank you, by the way, for that Alexis Keenan. We're going to pivot from legal battles and financial wrangling to a bigger picture take on Elon Musk's potential takeover. Tesla's CEO has labeled himself a free speech absolutist and while heralded by some, it is stoked fears from civil rights organizations and equal measure. Now from Twitter as a business to the flow of information we're joined by Sinan Araw, MIT Sloan School of Management, Professor and author of the hype machine. Sinan, always great to see you here. So what's your take on this situation and its meaning for the future of Twitter? Great to see you. Thank you for having me. You know, I predicted that this is exactly what would happen. That this deal would go through. I actually predicted it would go through at a slightly lower price is the market choosing that price for me at the $50 range. There could be some negotiations about a slight price decrease in order to get assurances on the Twitter side from Musk and the financiers. More tight language about how they could or couldn't be required to go through with the deal. We'll see whether the prediction bears out exactly. Obviously, when the investors came in, it was a different climate. Now there's higher interest rates, there's inflation, there's a lot of uncertainty to the Ukraine war. Just this week oil prices, OPEC and Russia constraining supply. So it's a much different environment to finance debt. The banks could try to back out and could trigger this escape hatch for a billion dollars by Elon Musk. But there could be some negotiations and Twitter could say we want assurances and we'll negotiate something to get those assurances. Because remember for the Twitter board, this was a no brainer at $54. This was a great deal for them and they'll want this deal to go through. Assuming the deal goes through, first thing you're going to see is a mass exodus due to firings and people quitting. People who are currently at Twitter, inside information says that they do not want to work for Elon Musk's new Twitter organization. Mostly, many of them would leave on their own volition. Elon Musk is indicated that much of the Twitter leadership he does not approve of their decision making. So he might get rid of some people. So the compensation negotiation I think is less important because you're going to see a wholesale clean out and a wholesale change in the approach. You're going to see Donald Trump return to the platform almost immediately. You're going to see moderation rules relaxed towards this more free speech environment, although you can't get rid of moderation entirely. You're going to see attempts at the subscription model be more forthcoming in the short term, a lot more bot detection and bot removal as well. That's in the short term. And I think we should also talk a little bit about the long term expect web 3.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,29,2022-10-06 15:54:56
2711," for term, a lot more bot detection and bot removal as well. That's in the short term. And I think we should also talk a little bit about the long term, expect web three strategies to enter Elon Musk vocabulary. Will there be a Twitter coin? Will that be related to the subscription model? How will that be financing the business going forward? Well, you touched on monetization there, a key pillar of turning the business of Twitter around. I've seen some ideas floated that the business model could follow that have linked in and corporate some of that of YouTube. What does this look like to you and what does this mean for the platform? Yeah, I think Elon Musk has made clear that he thinks that an advertising alone business model cannot save this company. There are a lot of people that agree with this opinion. I think that Twitter has struggled to succeed with a advertising only business model. Twitter blue as a subscription model was kind of a, you know, toh's dangling in the water attempt to see how it would go. You can expect much more heavy commitment towards paying subscribers for premium services and or for institutional accounts to be part of the strategy of an Elon Musk Twitter. In addition, I think that you can imagine that there will be other types of subscription models. For example, selling access to particular types of institutions in terms of information that is packaged up as information services for institutions, whether it be for prediction purposes or for other types of purposes. And given that it will be a private company, there will be a lot less oversight from the public sphere over what's going on. And you can also imagine an attempt to be more inclusive of conservative voices, which would try to get at the user numbers that have been steady, but not really increasing at the rates that Elon Musk would like to see. Well, we got to leave it there. Sin and Al-Ral, but I really appreciate you stopping by and all of those insights as always. All right, we got to talk crypto now with Bitcoin hovering around $20,000. As I think it has done for half the year, we're going to bring in Yahoo finances, David Hollerith, who's going to talk to us about cryptocurrency space and David. What is the latest here? Because we've seen Bitcoin not, well, it's been trying to get off the dime here. But I've been saying Bitcoin $20,000, as I said before, for a pretty long time. Yeah, Jared, the reversal is here. And RISC version has taken Bitcoin. It briefly went below $20,000 earlier yesterday. And now it's hovering right above $20,000. This is the key psychological point. Obviously, this is sort of maybe a potential into the strong start in October that Bitcoin and equities have seen. I think there's a lot of expectation around the jobs report that will come out tomorrow. And the CPI print next week. And the expectation is that Bitcoin's fundamentals from here could expect what analysts are calling a healthy consolidation from here. And that should remain the case for a while. As we see, the Fed pivot idea is sort of not really caring much ground. But we see a double dose of robust hiring on Friday in a hotter than expected inflation report next week. We could see heavier consolidation. All right. We're going to have to leave it right there, if it but really appreciate your time here again today. And we want to get a quick check of the market before we leave you to break. And we are looking at a mixed market right now. You can see the NASDAQ slightly in the green up about 12 basis points.

That is a South Korean ETF followed by home builders, transports, socks. That is the chip stocks, software and internet stocks. Those are in the green to the red to the downside, seeing some losses here for the cannabis and solar ETF sectors. Also checking in on the bond market real quickly, we can see the 13 week T. Oh, that's the US dollar. That is up now 8 tenths of a percent, but we wanted to check on the 10 year Tino yield. That is up six basis points to 3.82 percent. That does it for the 11 to 12 hour list take a look at one. Well, we already took a look at the market. So I'll guess what? Just come back tomorrow. See you on the job today 8.25 AM Eastern. It's promptly. Thank you. Everyone, the S&P 500 has had its best back to back days since April 2020. And the best two days start to the fourth quarter, going back to the first full year of the five day trading week in 1953. For more on what this means, the four the market's going forward. Let's bring in RBC capital markets head of US equity strategy, Lower Calvacena, Lower Great to speak with you this morning. Of course, in the futures at least right now, we are discovering that it can indeed go the other way still. And so with that in mind, how are we really set up for the fourth quarter? Is this just the two days at least that we had seen to begin October and the fourth quarter? Is that just a bear market bounce or is there something more that you're seeing in the tape? Well, I think both of those things could be true. We actually went back and looked at how markets traded in 2002, 2003 in 2010, 2011. And how that compared with the environment we're in today. The reason why we're doing this is because we're doing this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,31,2022-10-06 16:03:08
2713," are there something more that you're seeing in the tape? Well, I think both of those things could be true. We actually went back and looked at how markets traded in 2002, 2003 in 2010, 2011, and how that compared with the environment we're in today. The reason we picked those periods is because we had come out of major crises, had an initial bounce, and then we basically settled into these kind of year, year and a half type trading ranges where bottoms were formed. It took quite some time to get that done. It was painful. It was bumpy. It lasted a long time. And I feel like as I peer into the early part of 2023, that's really what we're set up for. So we've come down. We're seen a big battle back at the June lows. We dipped a little bit below them. But I think markets, you know, I've heard a lot of people try to defend that 3500 level. I wouldn't say people are crazy bullish out there. That's certainly not a stretch, but I think there has been, you know, this talk of a potential pivot, maybe earnings have been, you know, kind of worked down in the minds of the buy side at least, even if numbers still need to come down. So I think people are trying to come up with reasons why the market could bounce here at the end of the year. And I do think if you look back at that 0203 and 2010, 2011 history, you can find a justification for it. Laurie, do you still think we will see a lengthy bottoming process? And how long do you think I will play out? So, you know, it's interesting because that 0202 example, the stock market has been trading with a 72% correlation this year, with that 2002 period. And when I think about 4Q and 1Q, what happened back then really does seem like a reasonable template for going forward. And what I mean by that is you think about the earnings backdrop. We're going into this reporting season where based on a lot of these pre-announcements, we're starting to see it does feel like the earnings mandate is going to be ripped off, at least to some extent. But I think that that's not really possible to do entirely until we get into February and March of next year. And that's going to be year ahead outlook season. That's when the full year numbers for 22 are going to be reported. And companies are really going to be forced to talk about 2023. And so I think you're not really going to be out of the woods from an earnings perspective until you get to that through that 4Q reporting season. And, you know, we'll sort of see what happens here in the next few weeks. I feel like, you know, kind of short term predictions on earnings reporting season never quite pan out for anybody. But I do think that that earnings mandate, we're just really not going to have that visibility on 2023 for a few more months. Given the calls that we're seeing around and describing what another recession could look like from everyone from the economists to CEOs right now. And some of them saying that it should be short and not painful. At the same time, there is the question of how it would actually compare in the stock market reaction to previous recessions as well. What do you believe that might look like? So I am in the short, shallow recession camp, and I know that feels awfully consensus. And there's always risk to consensus arguments. But I do think that both corporations and households are in a very strong position heading into this relative to past recessionary period. So I think the starting point matters and the starting point is very good relative to where we've been in the past. Now, when you think about stock market reactions, I think that's why 3500 is such a battleground. Because if you look at the history of recessionary drawdowns in the stock market back to the 1930s, the median drop has been about 27% peak to drop. And that takes you to 3501 on the S&P. If you look at a meet, if you look at an average recession drawdown, it's a little bit worse. It's about 32%, which takes you down to 3200 on the S&P. As I talked to some of my friends in the technical analysis community who just read the charts, they tell me 3,500 and 3200 are also important levels to watch. So that history does seem to be rhyming or kind of sinking up with some of those technicals. I have a very hard time believing this would be worse than what we saw in the pandemic when there was just enormous uncertainty, enormous fear. And that was a 34% drawdown. So it took you a little bit below that to 3200 mark. But I think it was interesting that when confronted with that great calamity that was building on the health side, markets basically priced in a typical recession. So it's very hard for me to think we're going to do much worse than that this time. Laurie, do you think this is a market that would cheer a Republican just to take over in the midterm elections? Markets historically, if you look at the combination of a Democratic president and either a Republican led or split leadership Congress, that has been one of the best environments for stocks over time.

We also know that investors intuitively like RIDLOT And a lot of investors have worried that the Democratic agenda and I'm not trying to cast you know any sort of You know kind of view on this personally, but what I hear from investors is that they worry that some of the Democratic initiatives That are have been on the table in the past that haven't gone through would end up adding to the inflation problem So I do think that markets you know would benefit from a sentiment perspective From the Republicans doing well this fall and I think what's really interesting about that is back in June and July Even when sentiment was pretty dour in the equity markets a lot of investors were telling me the Republicans are going to do well That's a potentially positive catalyst for markets markets typically do well in the fourth quarter of a midterm year And then we started to see the polling data and the betting market data start to shift against The Republicans and back in favor of the Democrats and I think that took some of the wind out of the sales of the market contributed to the down move We saw but now if you look at the real clear politics data is starting to suggest that Republicans are doing a little bit better in the generic ballot And I have to wonder if markets are starting to sniff that out when you look at the price action of the last few days Laurie I have to give you in your team a shy a lot of these charts that we showed throughout the segment came from your extensive research big fan Always of your charts. So please do keep them coming RBC capital markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvacino. We'll talk to you soon You You For more on the markets let's get to city global wealth head of investments for North America Kristen bitterly Kristen great to speak with you here this morning here as we continue to kind of put in context the move that we're seeing today With what we saw to kick off the fourth quarter. What is this really set up for the probability of everything from a actual bounce that is sustained To a Santa Claus rally that some might be looking for come December I think unfortunately I think these markets require patience discipline and and a bit of defense We expect that we're going to see volatility and choppy markets from here through the rest of the year And I think what we saw over the past two days and look I'm not one to criticize any market rally But it really was a function of what we saw back in June as well some very oversold conditions Peak bearishness we know sentiment is that all time lows And so the market just having a little bit of a relief rally I think we'd have to keep in mind though that in bear markets These types of rallies are actually quite common in eight out of the past 10 bear markets We saw rallies off the lows of more than 10 percent and they didn't happen just once They happened several times So these tactical bounces are to be expected But it doesn't mean that we're out of the woods yet So Kristen that the market a couple days ago cheered weaker than expected ISM data Today we're seeing the market not like some hotter than expected reads on 80 p.m. Employment and then on ISM services just moments ago Should bowls be rooting for bad news on the economy? I think it really just points to the fact that the Fed is in the driver's seat and we say don't fight the Fed in bull markets We should also say",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,33,2022-10-06 16:11:36
2715," for bad news on the economy. I think it really just points to the fact that the Fed is in the driver's seat. And we say, don't fight the Fed in bull markets. We should also say the same when we're dealing with bear markets. And so the Fed has been very resolute and very clear on their positioning in terms of the fact that inflation, their ultimate target is 2%, and we're not anywhere close to that. And also with inflation, the Fed is not just data dependent, they're trend dependent. They're not going to look at just one number. They're going to look at the overall trend. And we need to see that come down. The second part is employment, unless we see a material decline in employment or a rise in unemployment, I should say, that's not going to change their trajectory. So I think the market, this bad news is good news, good news is bad news, it's everyone hoping for a Fed pivot, and we don't see that. So what we are seeing though is some of the banks at least calling for what could be a soft landing or at least giving the Fed a little bit more credence to say, yeah, we've got more confidence that we had in the past. Or on the other side of that, you have some economists saying, you know what, it's not going to be as bad of a recession as we thought it might be. Which of the narratives really do you believe has the most credence here? I think you have to prepare yourself for the probability of a recession. We recently increased our probability to about 70% in 2023. And the reason for that is again, looking back at these two data points, which are really the overall inflation number as well as employment, unless we see any trend really change, we don't expect the Fed to pivot. And so all of the tightening that they've already done in terms of rate hikes being the fastest and steepest in history, combined with quantitative tightening, this has not flowed through to earnings. So this is something that those tight, that tightening of financial conditions can take anywhere from six to upwards of 12 or more months to really flow through to the economy. Which is why we think the earnings outlook when you look at consensus earnings growth for next year at around 8%, we think that's way, way too rosy. And we're actually expecting if we're continuing on this trajectory, that we would see an earnings contraction next year. If that's the case, Chris, in that 70% chance of recession does come to fruition with an actual recession, should investors be holding cash? Is cash no longer trash? So here's the thing in terms of our portfolios and how we're positioning. We are preparing for this environment. And so I think it actually depends upon your definition of cash and one of the things that I do think, if we have any bright spots in the market right now, is the fact that if we look just over two years ago, 40% of the world's government debt was negative yielding. Now we have six month T-vils that are close to 4%, we have a two year treasury that's north of 4%. And so what we've been doing is adding some of this fixed income exposure, very high quality because of this concern of a recession, but very high quality in terms of US government debt, looking at investment grade corporates, municipal bonds, and even some value in bank prefers as well. So there's ways of getting marginally higher yields and getting marginally better outcomes, but still being pretty defensively positioned. With where stocks are right now and where some of the valuations have dipped lower to, for those who have a long term time horizon, is this a safe time to get back into the markets or is there still kind of a leg lower that you would be tracking against? So market timing I think is a very, very challenging thing. As you mentioned earlier, we do see Santa Claus rallies sometimes and 80% of the observations in Q4 tend to be positive. And so one of the things that I think if you do have a medium to long term time horizon, when we look at situations where the S&P 500 has declined by 25% or more, looking forward out three years, there's never been a negative return. In fact, the average total return over that time period is close to 40% out five years. The average total return is around 85%. And so in terms of putting capital to work and looking at opportunities now, there certainly are opportunities if time is on your side. Hopefully it is. We'll leave it there.

2716," you you you Elon Musk's pending acquisition of Twitter This poise to send shock waves through society, but also the social media investing landscape. Joining us for more on this is Rohit Kolkarni, MKM Partners, senior analyst. Rohit, always great to get some time with you. We're seeing at least this morning, now I know you're not a Tesla analyst, but we're seeing Tesla Shlare share his under pressure on this news. How big a mess is Twitter going to be for Musk, meaning how much Kenny fix it, and how much do a distraction do you think will be to him in his various other efforts? Hey, thanks for having me. I think Twitter has been a case study in kind of how a great business or a great company can have issues with business fundamentals as in be it overhiring, under investing in technology, and not figuring out the exact go-to-market strategy, not figuring out the exact disclosure strategy. So there have been ebbs and flows in the levels of mismanagement in Twitter in my opinion. So I think near term, I feel Musk, if this deal actually happens, needs to figure out the top level, sea level exact team that they need to have in place. He's been pre-vocal about criticizing existing management team. So I wouldn't be surprised in the next three to six months. He figures out who would run Twitter. Until then, I think it's fair to say that he would be fairly distracted with probably putting more time behind Twitter and putting less time behind other things. Obviously, he's a guy who works 30 hours a day. So I'm sure he can manage that. Yeah, sending satellites into space orbit and ultimately producing electric vehicles for sustainability here on Earth seemed just a little bit more important in terms of prioritizing his time. But then you do have what will be a privately held company at that point in Twitter. How does that change? What Twitter looks like in the future? Musk has also talked about in the past how he doesn't like the rigmarole of being a publicly traded company sometimes and he was referring to Twitter back then or referring to Tesla back then. He will get that chance with Twitter. What changes about the company? I look unlike a SpaceX. I think SpaceX is a case story as to how a large company can stay private for such a long time and yet have all the capital needs kind of satisfied in a way that they can. I think if Twitter can be that, I think there's no better person than Musk to facilitate that transition from a public to a private kind of player. But having said that, one thing that Twitter has is it's inherently going to be under public scrutiny. It's one of the widest known brands in the world regardless of its size. More people follow Twitter for media than many other kind of media platforms. I'm sorry, Noh Rabati, who here. But no matter what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,35,2022-10-06 16:20:13
2717," is more people follow Twitter for media than many other kind of media platforms, sorry, Nora, but Yahoo, here. But no matter what, there is going to be public scrutiny. So I think after the restructuring, after figuring out a very smooth running business, I feel it's in the best interest of Musk and his team to bring Twitter back to public markets. There is a scenario here that it may be longer than three years that what he initially contemplated. It could be five years, but it's better to come back to public markets, a much more smooth lead on company, a much more well-managed business than staying private because no matter what, there is going to be public scrutiny on Twitter, not that politicians, world leaders, other leaders are going to stop using Twitter if it is going to be a private company. Roy, do you see Musk owning Twitter for the rest of his life? Or is this, he comes in, tosses out the existing management team, cans of a bunch of underperforming executives that enjoy the free coffee and various other perks at Twitter, restructures the business and he takes it public again in three years? In my opinion, Musk is very, very passionate about what the core value prop of Twitter is. And in terms of how he himself has used Twitter for essentially evangelizing ideas and even to some extent getting product ideas from in a crowdsourced manner. So I feel he would probably be involved in Twitter as one of the largest shareholders. He is the largest shareholder right now, whether he stays as the largest shareholder for the foreseeable future remains to be seen. I would guess that in the next probably three to five years, he's still going to be the largest shareholder beyond that. Once he thinks the vision of what he wants Twitter to be has been achieved, he probably fades into the background, but I don't see him completely going away from Twitter, neither as a user nor as an investor at any time in the next three to five years. You talk about monetizing Twitter further underneath of Musk and it would need to be reliant on advertising and perhaps that remaining a baseline, however you believe or and some of the other street analysts have also believed that that could be a detriment having having Musk over top of Twitter and advertisers not wanting to continue to advertise at least in the same type of accelerated fashion that they had over years, even after Twitter added video. If you saw a decrease in advertising, then you have to increase the number of paid users. Is Musk alone enough to increase the amount of people who are willing to say, you know what, I'll pay to use Twitter. Would you pay to use Twitter? You're kidding a lot of challenges that Twitter has already faced in the past in terms of balancing monetization and balancing user growth. Ideally, they want both, but management in the past hasn't been able to achieve both. It's probably lack of resources, lack of vision, lack of execution, you call it. So if there's a way to manage both and on top of it, if there's a way to pivot the business model from complete advertising focus to a partial subscription and then advertiser subsidized, I think that is therein lies the challenge. Quite a few companies are trying to do that. If you look at what Snapchat is doing, Snapchat has a Snapchat plus. They think they can get to 10 million users next year. Netflix is going that way. So there are a lot of web properties who are going either from advertising to subscription or the other way around YouTube is doing that. So it is challenging. It needs focus, but I think that's the right step. So there would be a balance and along the way, obviously, the biggest challenges to have stable user base, I think, given what Musk can do and probably bring back a few other power users. Without taking any names, I think that that should help with diversifying the user base and probably bringing back the polarizing views that Twitter brought to the table. One of those power users, Rohit, might be former president Trump. Musk has not was not keen on that lifetime ban for the former president. If he does bring back Donald Trump to the platform, do you think advertisers will flee completely flee the Twitter platform? It's hard to say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,36,2022-10-06 16:25:01
2718," Let's bring back Donald Trump to the platform. Do you think advertisers will flee, completely flee the Twitter platform? It's hard to say. I mean, what I would say is there would need to be a mechanism for advertisers to be able to choose where their ads are being shown. And in a way that their ads feel to be next to content that they view as brand safe. I think that's the bigger challenge. It is okay to have content that could essentially not be co-shared for a bunch of users, but so long as ads are not placed next to it, I think advertisers would be okay with that. So I think that's the bigger challenge from a product standpoint where can Twitter if they allow back users, if they let, if they just take out all this censorship, or at least the quasi-sensorship that the company has, can they essentially go back to advertisers and say, by the way, we can ensure that your ads are not placed to the content that you feel is not brand safe for you. And these are the ways that we are going to help you do that. I think that's the bigger challenge from a product standpoint. I feel it's a much bigger problem to solve even Facebook and even larger companies have not been able to solve it in a more convincing manner. So they've just chosen to shy away from that content itself. So if Musk brings back a whole lot of content like that, then there's a bigger challenge for the company to solve. MKM Partners, senior analyst, Roe Hit, Carl Carney, always good to see you. Great analysis. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. you You Oh, you're seeing crude oil prices jumping after OPEC plus agreed to cut production by 2 million barrels a day. That is higher than estimates. It's an attempt to boost prices in an already tight market. It comes amid reports of strong pressure from the White House to avoid such a move. Let's get some reaction. From Bob Iachino, Path Rating Partners co-founder and chief market strategist, Bob, you know, the OPEC plus spin will certainly be about this looking at global demand, but you know, we did have the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak at the seat in Vienna. So, you know, what do you make of what played out today? How much of this is really about the global oil picture? How much of this is politics? Well, I think with OPEC, you're generally getting both. I think that's pretty certain. I mean, obviously you can flip that around and say that the release of oil from the SPR is also about politics because we don't generally get those kinds of reactions to price increases. The release of the SPR was large when the largest in history and it didn't really, according to the Department of Energy, only reduce prices by somewhere between 25 and 40 cents a gallon at the pump. That's from the Department of Energy. Now, having said that, it was good timing. It got certain national averages on regular gasoline, for example, down to comfortable levels, but this does seem like a crack in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,37,2022-10-06 16:29:15
2719," timing. It got certain national averages on regular gasoline, for example, down to comfortable levels. But this does seem like a crack in the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia while OPEC Saudi Arabia, while OPEC plus made this decision. And you mentioned Mr. Novak sitting right next to Prince Abdul bin Salman, who was actually in that room that's very discouraging in terms of what can happen with the inflation picture going forward, especially ahead of the midterms. We've already seen a spike in oil futures here. I mean, what does this ultimately mean moving forward in terms of where energy prices are likely to go? We talk about OPEC plus Saudi Arabia and Russia, but obviously there's many other members who don't often meet their quota. Yeah, and I want to correct myself. I said, been Salman. It's Abdul bin Aziz. But from that perspective, when you're looking at where crude oil is going, I still think it's going to be weak. When you look at demand, given the potential recessionary picture globally, demand has been falling off a cliff. Now, some of the refinery utilization numbers that we've seen the recent fall has been because of Hurricane Ivan. We actually had about 12 refineries and drilling sites shut down into golf as a hurricane Ivan came through. Those will be reassessing and reopening and we'll see where utilization goes at that point. But OPEC is definitely the driving force in price given that U.S. production has reached about 11.8 million barrels and can't go much higher without capital investment, which we've seen really depressed over the last 12 to 18 months. So it is OPEC that's going to be controlling this price. But if we get the global recessions that are being predicted, they're almost assured in the UK and the EU, not quite the same here in the U.S., you're going to get a continued fall in demand. And because this particular cut is going to last all the way to December 2023, that's going to put a little bit of a crimp in the people who are looking for a Fed pauser or a Fed pivot because it's likely to drive inflation, at least stabilize inflation to higher levels. There is another catalyst looming in December when you've got those sanctions on Russian oil taking effect. Obviously, these headlines coming out of G7 countries saying they maybe want to try and phase that in to try and limit impact to the markets overall. But how much of that has actually already been priced in, you think? Well, I think a decent amount of it. Again, I was short crude oil prior to the leaks of OPEC potentially cutting by a million. My prediction was they were going to cut by a million and a half and be able to sort of go out into the public and say we're actually trying to help our allies as best we can by not cutting to million barrels. They didn't do that. They went ahead with the two million barrels. So from a perspective of what's going on with the future output of production, they've already been missing their current production quota. So this two million barrel cuts really only going to be about 800,000 to a million if they actually were to reach maximum here. So the length of it is disturbing to me. The length of time that they're going to do this because this means that they can do, they've announced they're going to have meetings every other month now, which prior to that, they said that they would be on a need to know basis. Every other month means they can adjust as both up or down and it seems like their target is more to adjust production down. I think OPEC wants to see a hundred dollar barrel crude oil. I still think we're going to see 65 before we see 100 in the WTI market. And finally, Bob, we've got the EU agreeing on a price cap for Russian oil. This is likely to take effect later in the year. But what's the impact on that? I mean, there's some who are skeptical who say this can actually be an effective policy. But what do you see in terms of this affecting price moves? Well, I'm one of those that's skeptical about that. I don't really think it can work in the way it's structured. It's based on insurance protections and Russia's already said they'll self-insure some of their cargoes going to India and China. It's interesting to see a production cut because it might actually slightly be targeting these caps. If there's a new production cut, then Russia can absorb most of it and not really have to worry about the price caps as they'll be able to get out what they can self-insure and leave the rest alone and not really be defying their commitment to OPEC Plus. I suspect that's why Robert Novak was in the room to discuss the effect of the cap and probably to make it less likely that it's going to work. Bob, I, at China, always get to get your analysis, path trading partners, co-founder and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,38,2022-10-06 16:34:02

Bob Iichino, always good to get your analysis, Pat Trading Partners, CoFounder and Chief Market Strategist. Well, millions of Americans hoping for student loan forgiveness are waiting for online applications to open this month, but the Biden administration's plan could cost more than 400 billion and could give higher earners greater benefits. Another issue is mounting legal challenges in recent weeks. Biden administration seems to have reacted to this with some scaling back of those measures. Let's bring in Mark Goldwine, he is SVP and Senior Policy Director of the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget. We're good to talk to you today. What steps the administration has now taken? We've got boroughs with privately held student loans no longer qualifying for relief. You've been quite critical of the initial announcement from the administration. What do you think is going to look like? Once we go through all these legal hurdles? The administration is playing legal lacumal right now. I think the issue is very likely the courts are going to rule this illegal if it comes to court. The administration is trying to prevent it from coming to court by making sure nobody has standing. Private lenders complain you prevent people from rolling over their consolidating their private plans. People that are in the income driven repayment plan plan you create an opt out. The administration is trying to cut off legal channels for people to challenge this in court, but if it does get challenged, I think there's a decent chance it's not going to make it. What do you mean when you say it's not going to make it? Are we talking about a complete cancellation of the program? That's a possibility. I'm not a lawyer in economists, but I can tell you how much this costs. The authority the president's using for this unilateral cancellation was really an authority meant to cancel that for troops coming back from Afghanistan. It wasn't meant for every single person of the pandemic. It's meant for people with financial hardship. I think there's a good chance courts are going to look at this and say the president overstepped his authority. Spending is really the authority of the Congress, not of the president. Let's talk about some of the criticisms when this first came out. You said that this would was largely targeted towards those at the top half of the income spectrum. 57% you say to 65% of the extended positive cancellation go to help those who are in the higher earning bracket. Has that thesis changed for you at all? As you point out, the administration has done this legal lacomal and tried to evolve the program. I don't think it's going to change that much. When we were just about canceling $10,000 per person, this plan was very regressive. The administration fixed some of that by basically doubling the cost for people that were on the Pell Grants program. But when we found it's still up to two thirds of the benefit will go to the top half. I don't think any of these changes are going to change it much. Over a lot of people that were in private loans or people that have been in default for a long time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,39,2022-10-06 16:37:53
2721," Still, up to two-thirds of the benefit will go to the top half. I don't think any of these changes are going to change it. Much, remember a lot of the people that were in private loans are people that have been in default for a long time and maybe just got out of it. And so I think they're going to look distributionally pretty similar. As you point out, since this policy was first announced, the administration has been hit both from the left, as well as the right with those saying it doesn't go far enough and other saying, this is just simply irresponsible. If, in fact, your thesis holds, and I realize you're not a lawyer, but these legal cases really come to try and halt the program in some way. What do you think should be done in terms of targeting those who have debt? Is there a way to go about this policy without the wider bracket that we have heard from the administration? More importantly, is there appetite in DC to pick up that discussion again? I hope that if the courts were the soleagle, we're out of money, we actually have to think. And I hope the administration will reach out to the relevant committees in Congress and actually work on legislation to focus on higher education costs and value themselves. Because that's the real problem. As tuition is continue to rise fast, the people aren't getting as much value for that tuition. There are also things we can do to improve, for example, the income driven repayment program to make sure that nobody's really, or that fewer people are really stuck with debt. But that's not going to happen with some kind of across the board cancellation. The current proposal, I think, is mainly got to just add a lot to inflation, drive up higher edged costs, and give a lot of windfall benefits to folks that don't really need it. Mark, I do want to ask you about another headline number that came out this week. Gross national debts are passing $31 trillion. We're talking about just $1 trillion being added in a nine-month span. Obviously borrowing is going up because of rates going up. What does this mean, ultimately, for the fiscal health of the country? Well, we're in big trouble. Look, we've the highest inflation rate in 40 years. That's in no small part because of these very high deficits we've been running. We also are headed towards record levels of debt, even as a share of the economy. We're going to be higher than World War II. And with the Fed now raising interest rates to try to fight inflation, there's a very real risk that debt becomes unsustainable. We face one of these interest rates spirals that just a year ago people were saying wasn't possible. Mark Goldwine, SVP and Senior Policy Director of the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget. Good to talk to you today. Joining us with more on all this is Maria Vettme. She's State Street Global Market Senior Multiaxid Strategist. Good to talk to you today. Walk me through this big reversal that we have seen. We started Q4 off with a big bang. And here we are today talking about a big sell off. Yeah, hi. I mean, for us, the kind of big rally we saw earlier in the week was a minute bit unexpected. We still have fairly barely bearish outlook on the market. So it could have been potentially a little bit over exaggerated reaction to some concerns for science of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,40,2022-10-06 16:42:17
2722," outlook on the market. So it could have been potentially a little bit over exaggerated reaction to some concerns for science of concerns about labor market. But I think it's important to kind of realize that we came to this to the date release in Joel's number in a very oversold position in risk assets, right? So Stokes been selling fairly consistently for good six weeks, dollars close to all time highs. We have a very difficult position in the market. So market was a very short risk. You have a number that suggests that labor market is potentially weakening. You can change Fed expectations and boom, you have this huge reaction. But on the kind of hindsight, what we see is that actually US economy may be showing first signs of labor market weakening, but there are a lot more to it. And kind of our overall kind of barricade comes from consumers still have money to spend labor market. We don't know whether it's that week after all. I mean, you're putting chart of participation rate. We know that people haven't come back to work to pre-covet level. So money is still there. So inflation problem is not so difficult to get very bullish in this market. Yeah, that is a long list of things that you just rattled off in terms of concerns weighing on investors right now. We've obviously got that big jobs number coming out on Friday. What's your expectation there? And what are we likely to see from the market if, in fact, it comes in a little weaker than expected? No, I think you're exactly right. So kind of risk reward is very, very asymmetric. So market really light stone to first Joltz number, which is, I mean, not the primary number in terms of economic numbers in general, but market was very, very encouraged and hopeful that we have seen some weakness from what FETO has already done and they don't need to be very, very aggressive. So should that be confirmed by week payroll number, I think the reaction would be really, really huge. If we see, I mean, we're probably not in a camp expecting a lot of weakness and should that come then we kind of continue to going down, but definitely outsized reaction on weaker payroll numbers. We've said that we're looking ahead to that November meeting for the FET. In the meantime, we've got earnings season really kicking off into high gear. How much of that is going to be the driver moving forward, at least in the short term? I mean, that was really interesting because so far this year because earnings almost didn't matter. So what has was driving equity markets is really those macroeconomic head fins and compression and multiples while earnings stayed, I mean, not not great, but still positive. So companies were producing profits. So up to now earnings didn't matter. We probably expect something similar. We still expect corporate earnings to be somewhat okay, not great. So trailing earnings exceeding reported numbers. Guidance will probably be weakish as we worry a lot about the management of worry about a lot about tighter financial conditions. So guidance will probably be weak, but it's really about policy. So I would probably still say that yes, earnings isn't important, but macroeconomic headwinds dominate. Okay, Maria Vademan, setting us up for a very busy week.

2723," you pupu astronauts were sighing so they literally were seeing firsthand in both shave the stock price flight. They are looking then going crazy giving us these biggest oil cut that we've seen since 2020. We want to bring an Andy Lippau president of Lippau Oil Associates. Andy, it's great to see you again. So of course, the big question here is what this does to the price of oil. Goldman out this afternoon, raising its fourth quarter forecast, $110.00. A barrel saying that this is very bullish for crude. What do you think? Well, I think it is bullish. And we saw on Monday and Tuesday, the oil market react prior to the meeting and go up by $7 a barrel. And here we've added another dollar today on the back of the OPEC Plus announcement. The one thing that I would point out is while the production cut is advertised as two million barrels a day from their existing quotas, OPEC Plus is already producing 3.6 million barrels a day underneath their quotas. So the actual impact is more likely to be between 900,000 barrels a day and a million barrels a day. So then Andrew, in terms of the timing of this, could traditionally OPEC OPEC Plus, they do tend to stay the course in this. What do you think was perhaps the tipping point that led to this? Well, I think there's a number of things starting with OPEC Plus concerned about the world going into a recession, which in part was caused by high energy prices earlier this year when we saw crude oil prices rallied between $130 and $140 a barrel, as well as the high natural gas prices that we're seeing in Europe, which is causing a contraction and industrial output. So I think they wanted to take a preemptive step to reduce production in light of declining demand. I think another reason that they've cut production is to stabilize prices because they see a stronger dollar than higher inflation rates eating into their budgets. And we heard from the Biden administration shortly after this was announced saying that it will continue SPR releases as appropriate, also looking for additional tools to reduce the organization's control over energy prices. They talked about doing this with Congress. What does that potentially look like and entail? Well, there's very few levers that the government can actually do. If we want to reduce the price of fossil fuels, we need to get more of them out of the ground and the administration really hasn't been favorable to adopting those policies. One thing that has been discussed is perhaps limiting or banning the export of crude oil or refined products. But if we think about that, though we're part of the global market on crude oil, if we were to export less, some other place in the world, namely Europe or Asia would go without. On the refined products, we're exporting a significant amount down to Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and the rest of South America, as well as Europe. So these policies in order to reduce exports and build inventories here have significant ramifications between the US and its allies. And so to that point, then, when you have these sort of shifting dynamics here, what does this do in terms of US influence on OPEC and OPEC Plus and who is OPEC and OPEC plus primarily then focusing on? Well, I think that OPEC Plus's decision is really showing the waning influence of the United States, and they're really snubbing their nose at the higher energy prices that are impacted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,42,2022-10-06 16:51:14
2724," decision is really showing the waning influence of the United States and they're really snubbing their nose at the higher energy prices that are impacting whether it's the US or the European Union. When we do look at OPEC plus, you know, we have the core OPEC 10, which excludes Iran, Libya, and Venezuela. And then we've got a number of countries outside of OPEC, the non-OPEC 9, which of course includes Russia. But at its core, the decision is really rest with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates in Kuwait, who are currently producing at their quota. And those are the three countries that were reluctant to increase beyond their quota to make up for the shortfalls from countries like Nigeria and Angola. This clearly is not what the White House wanted, what the Biden administration wanted the decision to be. And, of course, this comes amid concerns about a weakening economy. If we do see oil prices jump from here, if we do see $100 a barrel, I guess, how big of a hit do you see that potentially meaning then for demand? I guess, to what extent do you see demand falling off if we are back above $100 a barrel? Well, I think world-wide demand could drop, you know, one to two million barrels a day. Now, if we put that in context with really high natural gas prices in Europe, I think OPEC plus is fear and even deeper declines and demands, maybe three million barrels a day, which could really put oil prices under pressure. And so, Andy, how soon do you think we'll hit that $100 a barrel mark? In terms of the domino effect, when perhaps US consumers might start to feel the impact of that, how soon do you think that will happen? Well, I think these higher oil prices certainly prevent gasoline prices from continuing their seasonal drop during the winter. So, I would argue that the consumer at the gas pump is already going to be seeing the impact over the next couple of weeks. Also, we're going to see a greater impact on the diesel fuel price because that's really where the shortages are located, inventories in the US are at their lowest level for this time of year since 1996. The European Union is about to phase in their ban on Russian refined product imports in February and their buying seven to 900,000 barrels a day. And as diesel prices go up, the consumer is going to pay for it in the cost of goods and services that are delivered to their homes. Certainly putting more pressure on the Fed is they're trying to get inflation down as well. A big thank you, Andy Liffel, for joining us this afternoon. Mariner's played a playoff game. We were still renting movies from Blockbuster Video, including the first Harry Potter flick. It was 21 years ago and Friday, the longest postseason drought on American professional sports comes to a close. Let's talk about it with Mariner's president of business operations, Katie Griggs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,43,2022-10-06 16:55:10
2725," Oh, and Friday, the longest postseason drought on American professional sports comes to a close. Let's talk about it with Mariners president of Business Operations, Katie Griggs. Katie, great to see you. Your star player, Julio Rodriguez, had not yet turned one the last time this happened. How do you describe the excitement level in Seattle? I mean, it's palpable. It was incredible on Friday night, if you saw it on the faces of our athletes, and the fans, and the stands, and then basically homes throughout our region. I mean, it really was a moment of celebration for this city. Getting that monkey off our back was incredibly important, and now we can focus on bigger and better goals. You are clearly the lucky charm in your first year. Hopefully someday, you know, being the only woman president in Major League Baseball is not a big deal, but it is now with the only one that has that title. What do you want young women to learn from your rise to this point? I think it's a don't have to be anything unique. It really is important to be yourself. But with that being said, it's helpful to see someone like you, and know that, you know, that there are people that can do it, and therefore you can do it. I hope so. The journey has been an interesting one for you. You enrolled in North Carolina, stated 14. You went to turn our sports. You worked for the Atlanta United FC Soccer Club, and now the Mariners, what's the common thread throughout that journey? You know, I've been incredibly fortunate throughout my career to be surrounded by mentors who have helped support me as I try to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up. I never could have scripted the career path that I've been on. With that being said, I've really built a career around learning and trying to find places where I didn't have experience, get that experience and see where it took me, and I've been incredibly fortunate that it's taken me here to the Seattle Mariners. Yeah, you weren't really focused on baseball. You weren't necessarily a baseball lifer, so how'd you wind up as president of the Seattle Mariners? Baseball's always been a part of my life. I actually played Little League as a kid. My neighbor had a batting cage in his yard, and we were always out there playing. So it's been something that's been part of my life since I was little. The Durham Bulls are my team growing up and Raleigh North Carolina. So baseball's always been a passion of mine. With that being said, for me, it's about the fans. It's about how do we use sports to bring our communities together? And baseball, we have 81 regular season opportunities to do that throughout the year, and we're really excited here in Seattle to hopefully bring folks together many more times throughout the postseason as well. And because of all those games, it's probably the biggest challenge in bringing that fan experience because there are so many games. It's led to some interesting innovations with the Mariners and Amazon. Tell us about that. Yeah, no, for us, it really is about ensuring every single fan has an incredible experience. And one thing that anyone who works in sports or anyone who's been to a venue knows is lines can be a real challenge when you're bringing tens of thousands of people together on a game day. So with partnership with Amazon and their Just Walk Out technology, we rolled out a, what we're calling our walkoff market. At the beginning of this season, and it's something where our fans can swipe their credit card walk in, get food, concessions, some chotchkes, and then walk straight out and avoid the line altogether. And it's something that's, we've seen tremendous return so far. Oh, boy, what a huge difference. So it's not just you, the league is making some changes. They're adding the pitch clock to help that fan experience next year. How do you think that'll help from the fan experience? And what else can the game do to appeal to a younger audience? Yeah, I think, you know, they're making a lot of moves that I'm really optimistic. We'll ensure that that fan experience stays fresh and meets the needs of today's fan. With that being said, I think one of the opportunities we have, and you've seen it here in Seattle this year, you referenced Tuleo earlier, is really, we've got tremendously engaging charismatic athletes on our squad. And so for us, we recognize when you're looking at Gen Z, you're looking at Gen Alpha. This is a, these are cohorts that grew up on social media. They know what's real, they know what's fake. They care about authenticity. And so for us, it's how do we ensure that we're showcasing our athletes for who they are, the silly, the fun, the competitive, bringing that to life in a way that resonates with both current fans as well as people who haven't yet discovered their fans. Speaking of the silly and the fun, I don't know if you know about the Savannah bananas, they're an exhibition team down in Savannah. They have more TikTok followers in the Red Sox, Yankees, and Dodgers combined. Is there something that can be learned from what they're doing and applied to Major League Baseball? I think the Savannah bananas have done an absolutely phenomenal...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,44,2022-10-06 17:00:28
2726," He's in Dodgers combined. Is there something that can be learned from what they're doing and applied to Major League Baseball? I think the Savannah Banana has done an absolutely phenomenal job of creating an experience, right? And so when you're looking at this, what they're doing, they're bringing the fun back to the sport. And for us, whether you're looking at exactly how we do it, I suspect it'll look a little bit different, but whether you're looking at the celebrations that happen after a home run, whether you're looking at about celebrations that happen after a winter, the ways in which our athletes get along with each other, get along with our fans. A lot of that fun is something we focus on a lot in terms of bringing that to the forefront and ensuring that whether you're at the ballpark, you're watching from home or you're consuming on social media, you're getting a sense of that. So think with the Savannah Banana, you're doing his awesome. Another fan evolution is you took advantage of the work from home concept with work from the ballpark. Tell us about that and you see this returning. Yeah, we'd love to. I think it was something we saw tremendous and interesting in our marketplace, which was a lot of fun. Now we recognize people are doing all sorts of different things and are working from a variety of locations. And really this was an opportunity. We saw some folks who were here taking Zoom calls from Microsoft Teams calls from the actual ballpark itself. We also saw some people who were having team meetings there and bringing people together. It really is about how do we leverage the incredible asset we have here at Team Noble Park to ensure that we're creating an experience that works for everyone. And we know for day games, a lot of folks have to work. So if you got to work, we can give you a pretty cool backdrop to do it. Innovative and inflation proof. You guys are offering tickets and a meal for 20 bucks. How was that done at the major league level let alone on an expensive city like Seattle? Yeah, no, look, we are tremendously fortunate. We talked about the 81 regular season home games earlier. That means we have a lot of ability to welcome in our community. And we realize our community represents a lot of different people with a lot of different economic abilities. We believe we have an opportunity and obligation to be a place where everyone can come together. And that means we need to price things accordingly. So on our value games, we have tickets as low as $10 and you referenced our value menu, which we rolled out this year. For $3, you can have a refillable soda, a hot dog, popcorn, peanuts, red vines. It really is something where we're intending to ensure that all of our fans, regardless of who he's here, they are, can come, can have a good experience and can afford to come back again. All right, Katie, I promise you this. Seattle is coming out to the All-Star Game 2023 in Seattle to see all these innovations. We'll see you there, deal? Can't wait to host you all. All right, Katie Griggs, president of the Seattle Marinus. Congratulations, best of luck in the post season. Good to have you. Thank you. Thank you. You better take me with you on that trip. I promise, you will. I'm in. We'll set up some jobs. I'm in an easy sell, yeah. I like it. Maybe we'll do the show from there a few days. I like it. I like the bosses watching. In this episode of influencers, venture capital list and domain money CEO, Adam Dell. You can invest today in the banking system of tomorrow. And that's a very exciting investment opportunity for retail investors. If you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that appeals to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and couldn't be more proud of my brother, Boyd, he's done. Hello, everyone. And welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Surwer and welcome to our guest, Adam Dell, venture capitalist and the founder and CEO of a new trading platform, Domain Money. Adam, great to see you. Good to see you, Andy. Thanks for having me. I want to ask you all about domain money, but first of all, I've got to ask you about the crazy markets this year, both in crypto and in equities. What the heck is going on? Well, market volatility is one of the things that is inherent in our market, right? Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,45,2022-10-06 17:04:25
2727," is one of the things that is inherent in our market. Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital into a discrete number of assets, you're going to have significant swings. As Warren Buffett likes to say, the market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in long term. And as I look at the long term trends, some of the free cash flows, sources that are being spit out of some of the larger tech names. I'm quite bullish on their prospects going forward. And as it relates to cryptocurrencies where we're focused, I look at the fundamental underlying components of blockchain technologies and their contribution to our financial markets, less from a speculative standpoint and more from a core market function, a core financial function. If you look at, say, example, VISA, VISA moved about $10 trillion worth of transaction volume around the planet last year. Last year, Ethereum alone moved 11 trillion. And so that just gives you a sense of the scale of the impact of these technologies and what impact they will have on our broader economy. I'll give you another example. Money markets. A few years ago, the number of dollars involved in DeFi, money market protocols was less than a billion. That's a 2018 stat. This year, it's over 200 billion. And so the growth of the financial utility of these underlying technologies is undeniable. And as they become more widely adopted in commercial use cases, again, unrelated to speculation, I think you're gonna see a significant growth in real revenue and real cash flow coming out of these technologies. Yeah, I hear you, and I wanna ask you more about those technologies, but just sort of again, back to the macro environment, because, say, first of all, with the tech stocks, they've just been such winners in so many ways in our economy, but the driver here right now is higher interest rates. Does that concern you? Well, I mean, interest rates have been so low for so long that there's a whole generation of investors out there and market analysts who believe that this is the norm. And obviously, on a historical basis, interest rates don't stay this low. And so I think, given the true cost of capital and the fiscal responsibility that is incumbent upon responsible central banks to employ, interest rates inevitably need to go up over the long term. And with regard to cryptocurrencies, blockchain aside, people are talking about Bitcoin and they sort of positioned it, Bitcoin and Ethereum, other cryptocurrencies as either a hedge or not correlated to equities. But right now, it looks like those currencies are correlated to equities. What's your take on that? Yeah, I think that is a reflection of the maturity that the crypto markets are going through. These assets are now more broadly held across a larger institutional base. They're now held across a larger retail base. And so downward pressure in the macro market invariably will impact crypto as well. All right, let's switch over to domain money. Your new company is it pretty new and what is it? How old is it? So we launched today. Oh, that's good. January 25th. So we have thousands of customers on the platform today. It is a robust, sophisticated investment solution for both stocks and crypto. We provide a number of differentiated features that we think distinguish us from the market, achieve among them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,46,2022-10-06 17:08:06
2728," and for both stocks and crypto, we provide a number of differentiated features that we think distinguish us from the market. Chief among them is our signal product, which goes really deep down the data rabbit hole around the underlying fundamentals associated with these crypto assets. I'll give you a few examples. We analyze the Twitter firehose as well as other social channels and we provide a proprietary social sentiment score where we basically provide positive, neutral, negative ratings on the social sentiment of underlying assets. Another thing we do is we track the flow of funds on exchanges, so tracking the on chain and off chain activity of underlying crypto assets, which is indicative of sentiment and price volatility. A third thing we do is we track project health. We look at the overall quality of the management team, the number of GitHub submissions, and we present all of these insights to retail investors in a very consumable and easy to understand way. Those are some of the things that we are doing at Domain that are unique. What about the timing of this all, Adam? With the Fed, probably raising rates a number of times this year, we were in this incredible bull market, particularly during COVID, where there was all those stimulus checks coming into people's pockets and then they were going out to broker dealers and spending it. Are you heading into sort of a wind coming in your face? Yeah, well, short-term market swings are not really the thing that we pay a lot of attention to. We spend much more of our focus on the long-term trajectory of these assets. As I mentioned, there are some incredibly powerful forces that are driving real cash flow out of a number of the investment projects, the investment classes that we're looking at, particularly as it relates to DeFi protocols. We're very encouraged by the underlying trends that we see. A lot of people look at the price of Bitcoin or any given crypto asset over the last couple of weeks and say, gee, this doesn't look really good. I look at something very different, which is that a couple of years ago, there was virtually no transaction volume moving around the world to empower NFT transactions. Last year, it was 23 billion. A few years ago, less than a billion in DeFi volume, last year, 200 billion. 11 trillion in transaction volume on Ethereum. These are profound trends that are not going away just because of the short-term volatility in the financial markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,47,2022-10-06 17:12:20
2729," you you you you it in And speaking of those profound trends, Adam, and you mentioned, you worked at Goldman, you mentioned Visa, what does your take on these legacy institutions? Are they gonna get consumed by these trends? Or are they gonna co-opt them? I'm everyone I always talk about Visa and MasterCard or Dead because of electronic payments. And of course they benefited like crazy. But now there are questions about those companies, for instance. Yeah. Well, we've been honored that we were selected by MasterCard to be part of their smart path program. What I've seen from the Visa and the MasterCards of the world is they've really wrapped their tentacles around anything and everything related to blockchain technologies because they like many smart investors see the opportunity set and what it can mean for improving the efficiency of our banking plumbing. The bigger story though is what these technologies will do to allow consumers to both borrow and lend on their assets. That game is going to change profoundly because of blockchains and represents for consumers a real opportunity to make real yield on their assets or borrow at a much more market-driven rate rather than one available from their credit card or from their personal loan provider. We'd explain to us how that would work at them. Well, if you look on a number of the DeFi marketplaces where you can borrow and lend, you see rates that are much lower than what you would get from a credit card or from a personal loan provider out there in the market. But aren't those companies just trying to garner market shares and then a money-losing proposition or is the margin on crypto so much lower so that it is still profitable? Well, it's a true marketplace where rates are a function of what someone's willing to pay rather than a fair bit of regulatory constraints and controls that prevent true market rates from being accessible to anyone. You know, the average consumer can't access a money market in the same way that an institutional investor can. And crypto represents an opportunity for those markets to be opened up to anyone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,48,2022-10-06 17:16:17
2730," that access to money market in the same way that an institutional investor can. And crypto represents an opportunity for those markets to be opened up to anyone. That was the metaphor I was looking for. That's great. Okay, and speaking of regulation though, you provided me with a nice segue. The Biden administration is reportedly looking, I was reportedly preparing, I should say, an executive order for release coming up soon that will outline a comprehensive government strategy on crypto. Is it a good idea for the White House to get directly involved here? Well, we welcome and invite regulation into this industry because it's an important step in its maturity. You know, I'm, I'm, I point people to the fact that, you know, China's efforts to try to clamp down on this activity had virtually no impact on the overall value of the market or trading activity for that matter. And it just shows you that information wants to be free and markets want to be free. And so I think it's incumbent upon the United States as a leader, financial systems and financial markets to think, think through the policy decisions around what is a stable digital currency. How do we bring this nascent market into mainstream financial functions while at the same time protecting investors from the things that are scary and may not be as above board about this industry. And obviously in any new industry, those, those, those players emerge. You know, Andy, you and I remember the early dot com period where there were hundreds of companies many going public without clear business model or any line of sight to positive cash flow. And yet despite all of that noise, an enormously valuable set of companies emerged that redefined the very fabric of our economy. And the same dynamic will exist with blockchains and crypto. We're in the middle of a Cambrian explosion of diverse projects and initiatives that are being tackled by engineers using these technologies. And some subset of those will become the very building blocks of the next generation of our banking system. Would regulation impact domain money? We've worked hard to ensure that we are following the letter of the laws relates to regulation because we want to represent this industry as it matures rather than being part of the fringes of the wild, west of the industry. Right. My understanding, Adam, is that you said, quote, the notion that individuals are rational actors as a false one, they're emotional animals and they make financial decisions based on emotion. So is that true? Okay, good. Glad we got that right. To trading platforms like yours though, then have an obligation to protect users from themselves. Well, you know, I believe it's our obligation to inform the consumer and provide them with as much information as we can to educate them about making rational investment choices. We really stress on our platform, education, transparency, and time-tested investment strategies. So we talk a lot about dollar cost averaging. We talk a lot about portfolio theory. We talk about a lot about market fundamentals. What is the market size of this technology? What is the product market fit? What is the management team? What is the business model? And what is the viability of that business model over time? Rather than, you know, things that are meme and momentum driven. And so while I can't protect, you know, individuals from making bad decisions, I can help inform them. And so our goal is to achieve that for investors. I want to ask you about wealth inequality in financial services because of course, the wealthiest Americans still on the vast majority of equities. And it's probably true about crypto, although I'm not really informed. I'm just guessing maybe you know the answer to that as well. How do we address that? Is that anything?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,49,2022-10-06 17:21:13
2731," of equities. And it's probably true about crypto, although I'm not really informed. I'm just guessing, maybe you know the answer to that as well. How do we address that? Is that anything that concerns you, Adam? Well, the most interesting opportunity for blockchain technologies is opening up of markets to a broader set of our members of society that don't have fair access to a financial relationship that allows them to live their lives. Borrowing money, earning interest on deposits, those core components of our financial system are available to people who have bank accounts, who have credit scores. And blockchain's operate differently. They don't require there to be trust between the two parties to a transaction. And so they, as I mentioned earlier, represent an opportunity to open up those markets to a broader segment of our society and to make available to individuals who have fewer dollars, a fairer interest rate, a real yield on their savings, which they might not otherwise have access to. I mean, if you're a merchant in Taiwan and you have savings, how do you get yield on those savings? If you're a doctor in Nebraska and you have savings in your bank account, they're paying you 0.06%. That's not a market rate in terms of interest on your money. And blockchain's represent an opportunity to open those up to fair market rates and real market rates for each one of those individuals. Does that mean bad things for the legacy banks? I believe that the legacy banks are smart enough to acquire and partner and evolve their business models over time to embrace the changing nature of how financial entities make money. If you look at banking over the last 10, 15 years, it's been, it's very clear what's happened with the introduction of Dodd-Frank and other regulation, you know, interest rate competition has been introduced into the market. And so the revenue that banks have made from interest has basically been cut in half. In response, what they've done is they've basically doubled their fees. And so they nickel and dime the consumer on these little things that, you know, nobody pays attention to, but add up over time. Eventually that that game is going to run out and true market rates. What can you borrow for at what rate? What can you earn on your deposits at what rate? Those will be made available to consumers without the required on-ramp associated with, you know, establishing a bank account. You will be able to access those rates through DeFi protocols powered by blockchain technologies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,50,2022-10-06 17:25:15
2732," you you you you you you you do you you do you or as we wrap things up here I got to ask you some personal questions, and of course that means I got to ask you about Michael your older brother Michael Dell CEO of Dell what was it like growing up with with Michael and what about it do you think contributed to the success of both of you guys your household? Well my mom used to like to say that she had three boys and she left out food for two. You know, Michael was always a young man in a hurry. He was always tinkering with something, doing something, working on something and he was pretty good at figuring things out. And so, you know, I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and couldn't be more proud of my brother and what he's done. Right. Okay. So, you're still working with him. I mean, you're in touch with him. You guys talk, what's your relationship like today? We talk a lot and I just saw him and he's doing well and working hard and enjoying his role as the CEO of Dell. Yeah, and it's just watching that kind of come and not go, but it's sort of had these different chapters, I guess, is how you characterize it, right? Yep. All right. And so, you've now found it a bunch of successful companies, your self-addom and you've sold some to different entities. What have you learned and what are some mistakes you've made, what are some things you've learned along the way? Yeah. Well, you know, one is that if you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that appeals to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. And so, I've tried to focus on finding market problems and solving them with technology. The second and this won't be any deep insight, but it's all about the team and the quality of the people around the table trying to solve the problem you're trying to solve. And so, I really focus on that. I'm very proud of the team we've put together at Domain Money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,51,2022-10-06 17:29:17
2733," the table trying to solve the problem you're trying to solve. And so I really focus on that. I'm very proud of the team we've put together at Domain Money, about 25 of my former colleagues from Goldman Sachs chose to join me in this new adventure. And in addition to those folks, we've hired Brad Olson, who was the head of content for seeking alpha, the head of trade-offs from Kenneth Fitzgerald. We hired a COO who ran the crypto business for SOFI. We've established a really solid team that is very focused on our mission, which is to build our customers wealth. You have a metaverse part of it or no? Well, we will bring additional assets onto the platform over time. I think you'll see us getting into the NFT space sooner rather than later. And so customers can look forward to that. In the coming months. All right, let me know when you get the metaverse thing down. Okay, I'll add that and go into Domain Money. Final question Adam, how do you see using your influence on this world? Well, I don't know how much influence I have other than, I like building things. I like catalyzing teams around specific objectives and goals and trying to motivate and set direction there. It is very fun for me to build things. I genuinely enjoy it. I get a real rush out of creating something and then having people use it. And so I'm very focused on making sure that we deliver the best investment platform experience in the market. I remember when Goldman was working on the Apple card and there was chatter among the industry and even within the halls of Goldman Sachs, what does the world need another credit card for? And if you've ever used the Apple card, it's really a delightful, unique experience. And I think the same opportunity exists in investment platforms where there are real improvements that can be made in the customer experience, the customer support, the education process, the journey that we take customers down as we help them try to make better investment decisions. And so I'm very focused on that as well as the rest of the team. Adam Dell VC and founder and CEO of Domain Money. Thanks so much for your time. Andy, thanks for having me. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirwork. We'll see you next time. You've got talent..... Welcome back to Y'all of Finance. I'm Brian Sausie here with Julie Heimann and Brad Smith. Markets are tiptoeing into Friday's crucial jobs report. It's seen some mixed action across the board amongst the major indices. But for right now, at this particular moment in time, all three major indices in the red. Julie, over to you with some breaking news on a market, you follow very closely. Alright. See this morning's Karai Sabigraad.ป Section",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,52,2022-10-06 17:35:08
2734," But for right now at this particular moment in time, all three major indices in the red. Julie, over to you with some breaking news on a market. You follow very closely that is mortgage rates. Well, now I do like everyone 6.6% 6.66% is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac that information just coming out. It is a very, very slight improvement over the 6.7% that we talked about last week as Freddie Mac, so Chief of Godness points out rates remain quite high compared to just one year ago. Meaning housing continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers. This is something that we have talked a lot about the real world implications of having these higher mortgage rates that are more than double where they were a year ago. The people are just going to pay a lot more over the life of the mortgage. It also means by the way that housing prices are starting to come down as a result because of someone is paying overall more for financing the house than what's got to give in many cases it's the home prices and the demand that we have seen also has been falling to some extent. Yeah, it continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers here. Freddie Mac also noting that they're going to make some enhancements to their market survey really improving and looking at some of the collection quality diversity of data use. It seems like kind of mirroring what we had seen from ADP earlier. This year of the summer this is a time to really get a better sense of how accurate the data still is and still as of right now for some of these rates it does still point to what we all expected and still some home buyers are experiencing is the higher rates that they're having to pay for an extended period of time which is kind of barring out. And it's just the average if your credit isn't up to snuff. Right. You're paying way more than this. Maybe last year at this point if your credit wasn't good what maybe you pay five or six percent now what do you eight nine ten. One thing to point out is people do refinance their mortgages right. So if rates do if you buy a house at this rate and then rates go down then you can many people can then refinance. So that is one little more positive tone here. All right. Let's talk about the implications of all of this and the implications of higher rates on the economy overall for that we bring in Kenneth Rogoff. He is professor of economics at Harvard University is joining us now Ken. Thank you so much for being here first of all. Here is sort of a very visible real world impact of Fed policy right. The rate the rate increase that we have seen in mortgages specifically in the effect that the knock on effect that has on the housing market. What do you think overall about the effectiveness of Fed policy with fighting this current bout of inflation? Well, we haven't had them fight about of inflation in a very long time. So whatever models we had you know we have to dust off and see. I think we know that their long lack of facts hits the markets very quickly. It's equity markets more slowly housing markets but things like employment that the peak effects can be a year off. So it's very hard. You know it's one of the things that makes it so hard for the Fed to get to a soft or softish landing which I'm pretty skeptical about. Okay. So with your skepticism about getting to a softish landing what would the reality of the economic detriment incurred be if we were to see what many economists are calling for a recession in mid 2023? Well I mean I think it could be pretty brutal if the Fed really is hellbent on having inflation come down as quickly as possible to two or two and a half percent. We have Europe very likely going to recession China. It at least a growth recession by all measures for the amorous session. That's a lot of pressures on us. The dollar is very strong and interest rates are rising very fast. So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession if that would be lucky. I say it could be a tough tradeoff for the Fed once the numbers start setting in. I'm a little worried that having gone the wrong way in one direction with the change in their framework and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation. They're now going in the other direction and possibly moving to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,53,2022-10-06 17:38:49
2735," and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation, turn out going in the other direction and possibly moving too fast, given the long legs. Professor, if the economy does get brutal, like you just suggested, do you think this is a Federal Reserve at some point next year that is back to unwinding these aggressive rate hikes they've been taking recently? So here's the thing, yes, but I think where we're gonna land at the end of this and now I'm looking maybe two years ahead, is that a level of interest rates higher than we're used to, even after inflation comes down. The real interest rate, the premium of the interest rate over the inflation rates, been extraordinarily low since the financial crisis. Some people say it's secular, stagnation, demographic, low productivity inequality, what have you. I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact it was abnormally low in that period and we're gonna get some moving back to being, meaning that interest rates, even when they start coming down, they not come down all that much. So how do we then determine what the sort of natural or stable rate should be, right? Is there any way of sort of gaming that out what that could look like? Very tough. My own research sort of speaks to the 10 year rate, which I think will end up at a higher place than we've been used to before the pandemic. But what's going on with the Fed funds rate, with all the regulation and the financial repression, is a little hard to say. So they really have no idea that's one of the things making it difficult. But if you're asking, I think it'll be higher than we're used to. For consumers right now, what should they be navigating, how can they best navigate perhaps, even leading into the scenario that you've described? Well, I mean, it's a tough picture where probably headed towards a difficult situation coming out of a difficult situation. Certainly I think employment is the key. Everybody's been particularly young people who've been moving jobs every six months or a year. They better think twice about that in this period when it might not be so easy to land on another job. Can I want to switch gears a little bit? Because you focus not just on the US, but on the globe as well. And you and some others are just out with some really interesting research on the real estate market in China. Now, so much attention on the sort of zero COVID policy and the negative effect that's having on China. But there's some underlying risk here that you illustrate in this research. We're looking now, you look at so-called Tier 3 Chinese cities, some of the smaller cities, although still pretty large, and that there's this excessive housing stock and that there's been really a sharp slowdown in prices and housing prices in those areas. What kind of risk is this presenting for the Chinese economy? Well, I think it's a huge long-term problem with or without the zero COVID policy. Housing real estate more generally, commercial real estate infrastructure has been the go-to policy for China. I did some research a couple of years ago, peak China housing, showing all the factors that suggested we really have come to an end of it. And more recently, my co-author and I've shown that a lot of that is concentrated in the more hidden Tier 3 cities, the Cincinnati's of China, so to speak. But they out, like we say, the Cincinnati's of China could be five and 10 million people. I'm like, maybe Cincinnati's of a few hundred thousand. And on top of that, there are a lot of them. They account for 60% of GDP. You don't see it that people travel to the big cities, they're less visible, but they really have a problem where they've been building like crazy and are sort of getting to the end of the line of that development strategy. And it's not that easy for them to pivot. And so what then happens when we do see China coming out of zero COVID at the same time that the rest of the globe is slowing down or even entering recession. I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,54,2022-10-06 17:43:09
2736," on or even entering recession. I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe? Oh, China's been enormously important for the rest of the globe. It counted for, I don't know, like a quarter of all global growth over the decade before the pandemic may be going into the first year, at least according to the IMF. And those days are over. I think we're looking at much slower growth in China, who knows what the real numbers are, but much slower growth in China for years to come. And of course, it matters. I mean, it hits commodity exporters, the hardest, that they have a raracious appetite for commodities, but European luxury car makers, et cetera. I think it's going to have a very big effect. And that's even without the Ukraine war and whatever happens there and which side China and so on. Can Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University? Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations, all of it, great conversation. Guys, let's get to yeah, we'll finance this. And as for right, we're at the Wi-Fi Interactive with a look at what's taking place here on the day. And as we're tracking. And you guys were just talking about those markets, right? And just looking at the home builders, we did see a little bit of action here with some of these home builders that had been in green territory. Now losing some of that steam, I just want to also pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see how much these home builders have lost year-to-date. Looking at the sector action, we are seeing the markets down right now. So you're looking at utilities and also real estate, which are moving to the downside. You've got energy, though, that is still in green territory. And over on the NASDAQ 100, some of these mega caps that had been in green earlier are now a bit under pressure in video had been up more than 1% earlier. Now losing some steam. Also looking at some of what's happening with our trending tickers, because we've got two trending tickers that we should mention on our trending ticker page. Well, that's the oil right now. But you can see also the US dollar index by the way going a little bit higher. That is putting pressure on stocks. And on those trending, we are seeing Pinterest that's trending right now. Number one on our Yahoo Finance page, that's after that Goldman call. But also, want to check out Costco because Costco's September sales came in higher than expected. So you're looking at those sales that increasing for Costco. And the stock right now up more than 1% year to date also outperforming the broader markets because that's Chuyi. But year to date Costco down 14%. Still outperforming the broader markets, you can tell consumers still want to get value big bulk. They love Costco. I love those hot dogs. And it's for a Thanksgiving chewy. I appreciate it. Because we're here before we had to break. You saw on that board, and it's highlighted Chuyi. Let's put a spotlight on the impressive week so far for shares of Chuyi. Stock is up close to 20% on the week. We're seeing it add to gains a little bit here on the early going. Dusting the NASDAQ composites 5.5% gain. The online pet retailers stock got a big boost on Wednesday, especially into the clothes as data from investment research outfit Yippet found Chuyi sales trending above expectations for the current quarter. We will note that Chuyi in late August, slashed its full year sales outlook by a couple hundred million dollars. And the stock got absolutely covered. I'm sorry, I was just going to say, I just bought some canned dogs on Amazon versus Chuyi. Oh, really? All right, let's take a discussion offline. Very interesting about that. All right. All right, coming up, supply chain rows are trickling down to the price of Ford's hot selling, electric pickup truck, the F-150, Julie's back with the latest business headlines.

2737," Patreon.yGirls.com Let's get down to business now with some other headlines we're watching. Uber's former security chief Joseph Sullivan has been found guilty of obstructing an FTC probe for failing to report a 2016 data breach to authorities. Prosecutor said he took steps to cover up the incident, classifying the hack as a bug bounty rather than a data breach. Sullivan's legal team said that after the hacker signed non-disclosure agreements, the security chief felt the incident did not need to be reported. The Sullivan now faces a five-year prison sentence for obstruction, and up to three years for failing to report a felony. That data breach, by the way, occurred during Travis Kalinick's term as CEO, where top performers were often given a blind eye. Meanwhile, General Electric is restructuring the company laying off workers at its offshore wind unit as it grapples with weak demand, rising costs, and supply chain delays according to reports. The cuts are expected to affect 20% of the offshore wind unit's US workforce, which equates to hundreds of workers, wind has been GE's largest and most profitable renewable business, but the expiry of renewable energy tax credits took a big toll on demand. And Ford is raising the price again for its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. It's the second time in the last couple months. The chief is versioned, now retails for just under $52,000 bucks. It's roughly 30% increase from the original starting price of about 40,000 with first wind on sale in May. Ford said in a statement, the increases on the result of ongoing supply chain constraints, rising material costs, and other market factors. Soz? Twitter shares continue to trade below Elon Musk's $54.20 offer price, as there's still fears on a deal getting done. Let's get more on this with cities, senior analysts, Ron, and Josie Ron. Good to see you here. Just based on your knowledge of the situation, folks, you have talked to, do you still think this deal gets done at that price? You know, we were pretty, the big news this week was around coming together, both parties suggesting with Elon saying we will, on our original $54.20 share offer, and Twitter come out, it's coming out specifically, and saying that it's something that we are looking to do as well. And so the fact that they're both negotiating table, not in court going against each other, I think that's a positive step. And it seems to me, it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,56,2022-10-06 17:52:23
2738," So me, it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be made to Twitter and when that would actually take place, even if and as this does kind of continue to work its way through? Yeah, I mean, if something were to happen, meaning that if it is acquired by Mr. Mosk and if we go through and it's a now private company, look, unfortunately, this has been in the public world now that this acquisition back in force since called it March or April, I believe, with the initial deal, initial offer there. And so Twitter's gone through quite a bit of change from then until now, not only from a business perspective with advertisers potentially pulling back maybe getting a little bit more nervous, some placing ads on Twitter, in addition to the macro changes that are happening out there, but then internally, you know, that there's just a lot of concern in our view around morale, around basically attrition or just getting things done in new products being launched. So your question of how long would it take to sort of get the business back up to speed? Frankly, you know, it would take probably some time to rebuild and the macro environment doesn't what would not help in the current environment where advertising continues to be a little bit of a softer subject overall. And Ron, we don't even know what he's going to do with the company, right? I have to say, man, it must be tough analyzing this company right now. You didn't know if the deal was going to get done. You don't know what Elon's going to do if he does indeed consummate the deal, right? I mean, we've gotten some hints dropped. There's been a lot of speculation. Trump's going to come back. He's talked about this, everything app X, whatever. But like, how do you, how do you even model concretely in a situation like this? Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company, so you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself to model and figure out what's next. But you essentially have to rebuild the business, right? So you start, I'm sure the first order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the service, onboarding with something that was a big focus prior to this saga that we're in currently. And so number one would be product. Number two then is figuring out how you best monetize. And right now the model is primarily advertising, but of course there's options around subscription, there's options around maybe payments or something along those lines purchases. So there's different things you can do. But I think day one, whenever this comes to a conclusion, has to be let's focus on the product, let's make sure it becomes that, call it town square, open free marketplace, and then everything else should follow. But it's not something that I think happens overnight. It's likely to take some time. Ron, is there an appetite in the marketplace for this super app concept that Elon is pushing here? Do consumers want to, let's say, go into Twitter, tweet then also maybe get taken to trade some stocks on XYZ platform, and then order an Uber, and then a hamburger for dinner. I mean, do people really want that? Yeah, it's interesting. The super apps here in the West haven't really taken on as much as they have, taken off as much as they have over in Asia and other parts of the world. And so that definitely is a TBD overall. Partnerships to allow things along those lines that would build off of what you see on Twitter make sense. You can see that happening. But one super app, it's a change in use case, right? And the thing with Twitter that haven't covered the company for a while now and looking at it quarter in, quarter out, the number one thing is a product be those monetizable daily active users. And so the more you can do to get those users on board, everybody knows Twitter. What's always surprising is you would think it would have a bigger footprint overall. And so that's the, in terms of users. And so that's probably the job number one. And if the super app does that, that's a big question. But frankly, it's still too early to even offer that. And I think you're right. It would have to be something that would at least be in line to what you are looking for and consuming while on Twitter. And there's partnerships that can make that happen. But it's definitely, I would say, the product is that's on the roadmap for down the road once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all of the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,57,2022-10-06 17:56:30
2739," for down the road once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all of the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes a media company? And I mean a media company with partnerships that can actually charge people for the ability to watch video content, whether that be from the WMBA, whether that be live sports or the partnerships with even some of the entertainment companies that they've worked with over the past, creating kind of a charging premise based on that, where the social connectivity just becomes an extra add-on on top of that. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do with the platform when you have as many monetizable DAUs that are out there. I would say, and we've always talked about the content on Twitter is amongst the best out there, and the content is really just an amalgamation of what people are saying and doing and tweeting and whatnot. And you can get lost in Twitter for hours, the challenges that product providing those details on what you're looking for, going more on a media strategy, working with providers and partners. We've seen success in that, right? And I think Twitter in the past has had partnerships by providing videos and highlights from the Olympics, from the NFL, from many different sports teams, as well as award shows and whatnot. So I think going down the media path is something that would continue. The question is, the model changes from primarily advertising to maybe some sort of subscription. That's a TBD. And I would say most entertainment companies on the web that have gone the paying for content, it's not an easy sort of chasm or bridge to cross. And so you really need to provide that value to get users to subscribe to it. And right now, again, Twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level. And naturally, the key thing going forward, the personalization. Well, Ron, unfortunately, I think this is the first time we've talked to you about Twitter. Unfortunately, maybe it'll be the last of this deal goes through. Although perhaps it'll be a relief for you. I don't know. We'll find some other good stocks to talk about with you, though. Thanks so much for coming on, cities, senior analysts, Ron, Josie appreciate it. Thanks for having me. Coming up, Europe's natural gas crisis and focus as the E remains divided on how to tackle rising energy prices will have the latest on the other side. we have here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,58,2022-10-06 18:02:07
2740," the This morning, Swedish investigators confirmed suspicions of many, saying that the recent leaks in the Nordstrom gas pipelines from Russia to the EU were caused by detonations. Now they don't say who was responsible for those detonations, but nonetheless, they say the preliminary investigation has, quote, strengthened the suspicions of serious sabotage. Let's talk about the natural gas dynamics in that area and indeed around the globe. For that, we're joined by Goldman Sachs head of natural gas research. That is Samantha Dart. Samantha, it's good to see you again. So we got this report this morning. I, again, it sort of confirms what a lot of folks had suspected. I don't know if it changes in your mind the calculation, the risks to supply, knowing indeed that it was detonations that caused those leaks. It doesn't really, we already expected it and I think this is pretty much consensus that Nordstrom one or Nordstrom two for that matter would not flow gas to Nordstrom gas. Not only now, but going into next year as well. So our Nordstrom gas balance is remained the same. Okay. And so, I mean, for those of us who are still trying to admittedly wrap our heads around this fully, I mean, the price impact that this would have towards the end users, the end consumers of this natural gas as well. Yeah. So, what the region is having to deal with is a massive lack of supply, right? This has been already established since the close from Russia have been curtailed and increasingly curtailed over the course of this year. As a result, we have seen prices skyrocket to 10 times or more, their 10-year average. And we expect them to remain elevated going forward. Now sequentially, it's a bit tricky because over the course of the winter, actually if winter temperatures are close to average, we expect prices to drop a little bit and bring a little bit of relief because you have enough storage to deal with that deficit. Now go and eat you next summer, yes, we still expect extremely elevated prices over 230 euros summer next year. Samantha, your colleagues over on the oil side of the equation raised their forecast for Brent, I know. If oil prices start to trend back up higher, will we see an uptick in natural gas demand? Or is that demand just kind of firmly capped by the price action we've seen on that side? So you're right that under this surprisingly bullish op-at-cut that has been announced, the balance for oil looks even tighter. And as our colleagues highlighted, you still have the risk of potentially a $30 per barrel spike to oil prices from here. Now even taking that into account, natural gas is still so expensive that it would continue to provide an incentive for users to substitute actually away from that natural gas and into oil. So one interesting anecdote that we've been seeing, especially going into this winter, is that now this gas to oil substitution is not even just about the power generation sector, but it's also happening starting to happen in the industrial sector where some users, instead of buying incredibly expensive natural gas, they're opting for using oil in their boilers instead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,59,2022-10-06 18:04:41
2741," probably expensive natural gas, they're opting for using oil in their boilers instead. Samantha, if we do in fact go into a more prolonged recession or economic slowdown, where do you see prices for natural gas going? So the interesting thing about this slowdown that we are seeing, especially in Europe, is that it's being caused by the lack of natural gas. So think about it this way. We don't have the normal supply of natural gas. So the only way to manage storage, the only way to guarantee that we're not going to face blackouts in the winter is to curtail demand. So this is why prices have been so elevated. And as a result, yes, we're seeing aluminum producers cutting back, fertilizer producers, gas, I'm sorry, cement, glass, refineries. So industrial activity is indeed slowing and bringing Europe into a recession because of the lack of natural gas. So this is what needs to happen until this deficit in gas is resolved. Goldman Sachs head of natural gas research, Samantha Dart, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Coming up, Guggenheim is calling this company its best idea into 2023. Now time for our call for the day. Despite Nike's inventory lows in margin pressure, Guggenheim is feeling good about the sneaker giant. The investment bank is maintaining its $135 price target and by rating on the Athlete's make or calling it its best idea into 2023 or another way of looking at this. They're saying just do it.

2742," decision that gets triggered from there, then Pinterest perhaps can maintain some of that fanfare among its new consumers, and that triggering a better average revenue per user on the site too. I like this note, and one reason why I like it is because I was at that Goldman Sachs conference. I saw Eric working in the room, and I saw the Pinterest team there. So this is a very thorough, I think, well thought out report by Eric Sheridan, who came on with us at the event, talked a lot about the headwinds that tech is facing right now, but there's a lot of expectations now built into Pinterest, and I think a lot of that rests on New CEO Bill Ready, delivering against some of these expectations, and I would just caution investors that it might take a couple quarters to see his vision play out on the top and bottom lines of Pinterest. Those shares are actually downless this year than I would have expected. All right, let's talk about, and speaking of shares that have been going down, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan upgrading the stock from underweight to neutral citing a positive impact from the Lenders reported restructuring plan. You can see the shares are bouncing a little bit today. They're up just about 1% in US trading, that is. Of course, they also trade in their native Switzerland, and JP Morgan, it's a pretty wonky node here, but basically they're outlining two scenarios. In the first scenario, a dramatic restructuring of the bank with a 70% shrink in its investment banking operations and exit from fixed income commodities and currency trading and equities trading. So that would indeed be a big change in that scenario. Their tier one capital ratio would actually stay the same according to JP Morgan. In the second scenario, they assume yet another half-hearted investment bank restructuring and they seem to be a little bit less positive on that particular scenario. So still some scenarios for Credit Suisse to sort of pull through this without needing to raise additional capital, I guess, is kind of the bottom line here by selling shares. This is a good bedtime read. Yeah. Oh, the realtor is. Hey, the Nike guy died, right? They just do OK. All right, before we get... Giving people information. Well, you know what, here's the thing. Nike is then great. Pinterest, maybe they'll do better, and Credit Suisse, we'll see what they do. Guys, coming up on the other side of this show break. We've got our, well, we've got much more here on Yahoo Finance. Including, well, we don't have the fan who caught Aaron Judges' 60-second home on ball. But guess what? He's fielding offers upwards of $2 million. We've got more on the other side. Yeah. Good afternoon. Yeah, good afternoon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,61,2022-10-06 18:16:12
2743," seven you Slava, Debase. Time for Cup of Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. People still want their Costco hot dogs and bulk groceries, despite rising prices. Costco reported another strong month of sales. For September with net sales, up 80 or 8.5%, 80.5% year over year. This despite same-store sales, dipping on lower gas prices. All right. You're taking a look at some of the comps, up 8.5% year over year, 4 Costco. People still want it. You love it. You like saying about this hot dog? I will refrain from saying something funny on the hot dog. And I'll say this, it was good to see prices decelerate in September versus August. So another little sign that inflation in a lot of these everyday categories that a Costco grocery stores you name it, is starting to roll over a little bit. And that's a good thing. I think for consumers spending into the holidays. I will say, I think they recently said that they're not going to raise their membership price yet. You're predicting one that was made. It's coming, it's coming. It is. Yes. And the gold. It's not like it's not coming this year. They waited me the last minute, but it's going to be a big earnings driver for that company. Yeah. And I mean, comparatively, Costco, BJs, Sam's Club, underneath of Walmart, all of them had been trying to cozy up to the consumer, especially in the bulk buying boom. That would say. Indeed. All right. Uber is reviving itself driving vehicle plan after selling its autonomous driving research division. Uber signed a 10-year deal with an emotional to add self-driving cars to its vehicle lineup. The self-driving cars would work for both Uber and Uber Eats and several U.S. cities upon launch. Still no details on where, where that will be. And, you know, I recently saw some of my first self-driving cars out in San Francisco. I know some, you know, going to New York, going to another place. And I think it was a ZUX. I just can't see how these are the future. I still have a driver behind them. And I still ordered Uber. I didn't order a ZUX, but they look cool. And that's all you got for me. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like it's really early stage. I mean, regulations, like nothing is there yet. Yeah. I've interviewed the CEO of ZUX and the founder of ZUX before. And, of course, all of those companies that you kind of lumped together there between ZUX, between Waymo, and then even for Uber and some of their driverless technology, it's all going to be dependent upon how well they're also able to license that out to some other companies. That want to take advantage of it in the future too. But, again, a lot of red tape that they've got to get through. And then, additionally, when you think of the customer, and how this is able, going to be able to cut down costs for the customer as well as the company, operating costs per mile, north of a dollar. This could perhaps bring it below 40 cents. Yeah. All right. And a big payday for the lucky baseball fan who caught Aaron Judges, that Aaron Judges ball. The ball estimated to bring in $2 million at auction, as of now the Dallas-based man that caught the ball has not decided what he wants to do with it. He could give it back to Judges and the Yankees, or he could sell it himself. Another unknown is taxes. The IRS has yet to come in, but some experts speculate catching the ball could count as a taxable... Isn't this guy a millionaire? That's what I was told by our team. I don't know anything about him. Oh, good for him. So then, is it a capital gains tax because you paid for the... Sounds like he could afford it....to go to the game. And then now your return on that is you actually got a good bet off. I mean, I just think it's fascinating that the regulations are such that when you catch a ball, it becomes your property. And one of our producers, Connor Hickey, was explaining to us, it's written on purpose that way, because it absolves them of liability if you are injured by something flying, right? Whether it's a bat or a ball or whatever it may be. I think Connor owns a lot of Mickey Mantle rookie cards, so he's sitting on that ball. So he knows a lot about that. Okay. Alright, guys, coming up next, we're going to talk a little Tesla. Stick around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,62,2022-10-06 18:20:29
2744," Now there's a lot about that. Alright guys coming up next. We're gonna talk a little Tesla, stick around. Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla, T-S-L-A. Tesla's shares are moving lower on the day by 1.2% of the shares. Around the tech-tightened sales of Tesla shares to finance, deal making coupled with whether he might be too distracted to hit targets at Tesla. Just one point, for regulatory reasons, So Is Elon Musk too distracted to run Tesla. Frankly, Tesla's his baby. This company is a great expression of his personality and he has shown tremendous capability to manage many different things, nerling the boring company, SpaceX, and other outside ventures. And the intellectual curiosity necessary to execute pretty well there. So will it possibly take time away from Tesla? Yes. I think the question that probably needs to be asked is will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And I'm not the best judge of that. I think you already have some pretty clear ideas on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,63,2022-10-06 18:25:33
2745," is will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And I'm not the best judge of that. I think he already has some pretty clear ideas on Twitter and he does have a history with PayPal and the digital payments space, which I think is part of his vision on fixing that asset. So it doesn't bother me for Tesla. I have other reasons that I'm very bearish on company, but I have tremendous respect for what they've done. Well, we'll get to those reasons in a second, Craig, but does it even matter if Elon is distracted? Who cares? And I mentioned that because we have EV tax credits in play that are probably going to be a big tailwind to Tesla and then we have cars that people just really seem to be obsessed about. Yeah, I mean, they've done each for a menace job, right? They've basically made the automotive industry sexy again. The last time it was sexy was the 1950s. That was when it's had come out of the best universities in the world and say, oh my gosh, I want to work for a car company. Now, those same kids are coming out and saying, I want to work on electric vehicles. I want to work on future drivetrain technologies. Elon Musk deserves a lot of that credit because it's his vision and his commitment that's allowed that to take place. Does it matter? Does it really matter for Tesla so much? Not really. The flywheel is rolling, it's running. And they have very different issues to manage through over the next couple of years than what they've had to challenge through to date. And whether or not Elon Musk is the one that's the right person to make those decisions, we'll find out. I'm skeptical. I think there's some very challenging things ahead for this company. And if Musk is maybe reducing his intensity with the company, it might not be a bad thing. Craig, I know there's no imminent changes at the top of Tesla, but is there anybody else there who could run the thing besides him? Oh gosh, that's a tough question. I don't think so. I mean, I've talked to a lot of former Tesla executives. I know people that have turned down positions at Tesla that are leaders and they're respect to various. It's a difficult company to work at because Elon Musk is an unreasonable person. Not in a bad way, but in a motivating way where he doesn't take no for an answer. He wants to learn what you got wrong, why you got it wrong, how you got to do a different to achieve the goal. So yes or no, yes, we got it. No, we didn't. A lot of people aren't well-tooled to work in that environment. And there's a lot of burnout and a lot of turnover as people like to talk about for Tesla with heavy, heavy departures over here. Craig, I only got 30 seconds here. Colder months, they're coming soon. China and Tesla production, that's going to remain one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns. As it doesn't seem China's going to change their zero-COVID policy anytime soon. China's going to be tough for them, that's going to determine whether or not they make their numbers this year, 20,000 unit mists or 19,000 unit mists is China, right? I don't think this is what's the biggest issue for the company. It's a big issue with competition and alternative equities like Porsche and the upcoming Ford spin-off. Large, well-established properties that are executing well. You have other examples of some of the SPAC IPOs that are actually showing success. And Tesla has big problems on the horizon as far as this competitive environment. And they don't really have the technology lead that many many people claim. Everybody has access, this name, same database. Imagine that, competition for Tesla, Craig. Thank you so much, Craig Irwin, Rothka, and the Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst. I appreciate your time this morning, thank you. Thank you. And one final check on the market before you leave you as we see Twitter shares a little bit weaker here today. So we're the overall markets, not seeing a huge decline, but a bit of a pullback. And coming up in the next hour, more on the Twitter drama with Sinan Oral and Yahoo Finance is Jared Glickry, Sinan who is literally worth a book.

2746, I finance it's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Blickery and here's what I am watching. Stocks dip as yields take higher amid uncertainty over the path of inflation. Tomorrow's jobs report is a main event and we'll talk market positioning with Black Rocks way Lee in a minute. Goldman Sachs by the way stays bullish on oil raising its crude forecast to $110 a barrel. That's at the aftermath of this OPEC plus decision. Joe Biden's his move cut move was cut was short-sighted and we'll see if the energy world's Dan Dicker agrees with us and investors wait for progress on the newly revived discussion between Twitter and Elon Musk. We look at the chance of a deal and the flow of information if we get one. But first let's take a quick look at the markets we see the Dow under a little bit of pressure down about 100 points the S&P 500 off about one quarter of a percent and the Nasdaq off just slightly and then checking in on the bond market we do see yields elevated just ever so slightly in the looks like the five ten and also thirty year tenor and with all eyes on tomorrow's jobs report let's welcome in Black Rocks global chief investment strategist way Lee and could you please give us your forecast and by the way it's great to see you here could you please give us your forecast of what you expect tomorrow because this is one half fifty percent of the feds dual mandate a lot of eyes on this report hi there good morning thanks for having me so in terms of the jobs report I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,65,2022-10-06 18:33:16
2747," A lot of eyes on this report. Hi there, good morning, thanks for having me. So in terms of the jobs report, I think given how strong earlier momentans are, it's possible that we could see kind of headline decrease, but I would say that our focus is really solely what mainly around the participation rate, because labor shortage has really contributed to this supply-shaped environment. So if that starts to be alleviated, certainly that would have feed through to inflationary dynamics, and that would feed through to market pricing for rate hikes and also broadly risk sentiment as well. And let me ask you just generally about some of the central bank actions we've seen around the world over the last two weeks. A bit of a 180 by the bank of England. Now buying bonds, albeit for a short period of time, ostensibly speaking, also the bank of Japan buying the US dollar, or excuse me, buying its own currency, the yen trying to strengthen that versus others as well as the US dollar. What are you seeing in the global effects world? And what implications do you think this might have for equities, especially as we consider these jobs numbers that you just explained to us? I think what we're seeing really is a result of this supply driven new regime that we're in, whereby given the fact that inflationary pressure comes from supply, bottlenecks, and supply shortages, then it's a lot harder for central banks to fight that. There are tools, a primarily focused on addressing the demand side of equation. So you talked about bank of England going from announcing QT to start buying bonds. Obviously there are specific kind of fiscal development in the UK that led to the bond buying, but more broadly it just goes to show how difficult it is for a central bank decision making in this supply driven environment characterized by tougher trade-offs. And you also talked about bank of Japan and more broadly policy development and currency as well. I will make one observation so far this year, depending on where you are based, depending on which currency you are denominated, your experience of the global market returns can be vastly, vastly different. Part of that is the dollar strength, but it's more than that as well. So dollar in the near term is very much driven by rate differential as well as global risk, calm and risk of sentiment so far has been very, very strong. But given the fact that how much currencies are contributing to the experience of investors of the global markets, we think that it's actually really important when we think about our allocation to consider where our investors and clients are based in, which is why we're rolling out regional asset locations. So for example, I am sitting here in the UK and we recently rolled out Euro asset location views. So really from the perspective of the Euro denominated investors, how their asset allocation could look like versus a dollar denominated investors. And that is critical, being local is critical in the context of the elevated macro uncertainty and elevated currency volatility. Yeah, call it part for the course versus, I guess, based on this trend of de-globalization that we've seen over the last five plus years. Now, I want to talk a little bit more generally about the, we saw the US dollar strength in versus most currencies quite considerably. It's backed off of that. And the other part of the equation there is with an easing US dollar in the short term, we're seeing a bid for commodities. Now, we've been talking a lot about OPEC plus and oil, but I want to focus on silver, gold, and some of the other commodities that we've recently catch a bid. A lot of people have either been waiting for gold to catch a bid or have just counted it out entirely. What do you think of the precious metal complex right now? Well, exactly as you framed the correlation between the dollar and precious metal has been in place. And I think in that context as dollar, Wikens, you talked about how the risk on sentiment earlier in the week led to a weaker dollar. It has been somewhat supportive, or firm, of companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,66,2022-10-06 18:37:26
2748," You talked about how the risk on the sentiment earlier in the week led to a weaker dollar. It has been somewhat supportive of commodities and precious metals for that matter. But I would broadly say, though the importance of diversification cannot be overstated in the context of the world that we're entering into. So thinking about the macro environment, we're currently expecting a recession. This year in Europe, in the UK, and next year in the US. And at the same time, risks of central banks over tightening policies into restrictive territories in order to fight inflation. The risks of that have risen significantly. Recently, but also certainly versus beginning of the year. So in this kind of environment where it makes sense to be more prudent when it comes to our location, when it comes to portfolio risks taking, than having diversification in portfolio makes sense and certainly goes to play the role in that. And I think that is also part of the considerations behind recent price action. We got a time for one more, a bit brief here. But I want to talk to you about the Chinese UN and also policy makers there. We've seen the UN strengthen against the Japanese yen about 12% year to date. Yen has considered, we can consider it, and I talked about the measures by the BOJ before. Do you think the PBOC intervenes in the yuan here? And what consequences would that have for global risk assets? Well, I think more broadly when we talk about the Chinese yuan, we also have to talk about the Chinese economy. Right? So what has happened so far this year is that there has been significant headwind for Chinese economy from the perspective of the zero-covid policy, acting as a dampener to economic reopening momentum and at the same time previously the Chinese economy was supported by the tailwind of global exports. Right? Like when the rest of the world was in shutdown, the export from China and the demand for that has added to strong momentum last year. But now the rest of the world is switching back on and China is in zero-covid mode. So that export tailwind is fading away as well. And both of their act as headwind and challenges for Chinese economy this year and the Chinese currency movement so far this year are reflection of that. You talked about versus the yuan, but also versus the dollar of course, the dollar story is beyond more than just Chinese yuan. I would say one thing though, as we kind of head into next year, some expectation needs to be big deal around the restart momentum, obviously a lot contingent on how the COVID policy would evolve. But in the same way that the US economy opened up with strong momentum, your PM economy opened up with strong momentum in such an expect higher growth levels next year versus 2022. So if I say lots of moving parts here, really appreciate your insights as always, Wailie, BlackRock, Global Investment Chief Strategist. Thank you for your time. And we're keeping an eye on oil prices as well this morning following a big move by OPEC Plus to slash output by two million barrels a day beginning in November, exceeding market expectations and incurring the wrath of the Biden White House for more on this. Let's welcome in, Yahoo finances in S for a and we got a little bit of a surprise yesterday. And as we've been talking about now, OPEC Plus has already not been able to fill its quotas. So they said, this is really just a cut of about one to 1.1 million barrels per day. That's still a lot of nests. Yeah, that's, that is, it's significant. It's a significant cut and one takeaway is that OPEC Plus must be concerned about a world ride recession in order to be making such a cut. Goldman Sachs came out with a forecast and updated forecast saying that oil could reach $110 a barrel in Q4, also $115 a barrel by the end of the first quarter of 2023. And if these cuts are sustained through December of 2023, then these elevated prices would remain elevated. I mean, the only thing that could bring it down is really demand destruction at this point. Now, during the financial crisis, Jared, between 2008, 2009, oil prices, those had peaked at $145. It came all the way down to $30.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,67,2022-10-06 18:41:45
2749," down is really demand destruction at this point. Now during the financial crisis, Jared, between 2008, 2009, oil prices, those had peaked at $145. They came all the way down to $35 a barrel in five months time. Andy Lipo of Lipo Associates is saying basically that, look, they must be worried in order for them to be doing this. It also shows you that the US dollar has also been having a huge impact on these oil prices. We've also seen some rubblings or heard them that the Biden White House would also consider another release from this strategic petroleum reserve that's the SPR. We saw that take a place and be in effect earlier this year. I think those purchases or those releases have now concluded, but what about the possible effects of any new releases from the SPR? Yeah, well, certainly that would have a short term effect. Like we've seen with gasoline prices, as we've seen those gasoline prices coming lower. But one interesting point also about this OPEC plus decision is it kind of also shows you the waning influence of the US, because this is as much as it is about demand and supply as it is also political in a way as well. And the sort of relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the sort of waning influence that the US is having on the cartel as well. Yeah, and I'd add the most important influence the US has on the cartel is the fact that WTI, a most global oil is quoted in US dollars. So a huge investment, I would guess you would say, to protect right there. Thank you for that. Yeah, who finances in us for it? All right, our trending ticker of the day is Pinterest. It is surging 45% after Goldman Sachs, upgraded stock to buy from Newfrolet and raised its price target to $31 from $24. Goldman analysts, Eric Sheridan likes the improvements in user growth and engagement, as well as the potential for revenue growth and operating margin into next year in 2024. Monetization is a key area that Goldman also likes with the prospect for the social media company increasing its share of ad spending and that's as companies cut budgets and expenses and coming up. You're going to want to take a look at this. Talking cyclical stocks, the ride continues, love that plan continues for Peloton. As a pandemic era, darling announces 500 more job cuts. We're about 12% of its workforce. Will the struggling group find its feet? We take the deep dive next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,68,2022-10-06 18:47:37
2750,"locks every day enroll to obey to release new Welcome back. Peloton laying off a large number of its employees. 500 to be exact for the fourth time this year in another effort to save its struggling business. Yahoo! Finances Brad Smith here with the latest Brad what are the details? So the details around this of course as you laid out yet another round of layoffs for Peloton and this is really under the direction of the new CEO Barry McCarthy who is really looking to cut costs and make sure that in this environment where the company is trying to create more partnerships on the wholesale front see more of their cash and capital be put towards actually being able to continue production but also the right sizing of production and overall just the structure of the company that that really comes down and hits some of unfortunately the employee base. Now what we also do know is that even over the course of earlier this week they had netted some new partnerships on the wholesale front and it really kind of spells out what Barry McCarthy is looking to do is tap some of those wholesale partners look to those channels to potentially drum up even more subscribers within everything from Dick Sports all the way to your Hilton stake and then eventually being able to at the same time build on the digital subscriptions the number of people that are continuing to use these connected devices but then it comes back to if he does not see the growth necessary in this next stretch of time and he's looking out to these six month period even out as far as 18 months perhaps to say whether or not Peloton has been successful at implementing some of these changes and if it will prove to push them back to profitability as well. One at Hone and we got a brief second here on that timeline. Sure. Now he based but this is McCarthy basically gave the company six months and he did not immense words here have you ever heard of a CEO of a company give a going concern risk factor to its employees basically in this context. Not one that isn't already looking at perhaps some type of bankruptcy. It would have to be imminent. Immunin threat and what's even more noteworthy about that is whether or not they would actually be looking for a sale if they weren't able to hit some of those potential targets because he did bring up this thought of I don't know if we are a standalone company or a viable standalone company just Peloton if we're not able to hit some of these financial targets that we've set forth. He did say that this is the most optimistic that he has been but he certainly to your point did not immense words there and it starts to raise the question about who would buy a Peloton especially when you've already got other stationary bikes that are being sold at Dix that are already being sold on Amazon. So then it gets into the rest of the fitness category and the connected device category too and it's really tough to sell on whether or not it would be a company in Apple or some other major tech company that would say no what yeah we'll take on a connected fitness device company where they've already struggled to kind of move lots new homes. Yeah lots of baggage there we'll have to see what happens but peak Peloton with the stock down over 90 percent we'll see what comes of that. Thank you for that Brad Smith. And now a new game all the kids are playing as well as Wall Street veterans and they're raging about it. Spac D-spac or Fold and who better to join us with an update of this beleaguered sector is Alexander Seminova Alex you excuse me you've been covering this and IPOs have done poorly this year. Spac's much worse. What are the details? Yeah, it's just a terrible time for the SPAC market such a huge turnaround from last year and the year before what has been called the SPAC Renaissance East Child that saw this",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,69,2022-10-06 18:50:36
2751," So terrible time for the SPAC market. Such a huge turnaround from last year and the year before, what has been called the SPAC Renaissance Beast Show that saw this sharp uptick in SPAC activity. And really a big come down this year. SPAC liquidations are on the rise with these bling check companies really struggling to find targets for their deals to close so far this year. 22 special purpose acquisition companies worth about $10 billion have been liquidated. According to a weekly report by SPAC research, that's more than half of those liquidations have occurred since August. And that's not even taking into consideration the liquidations that have been announced and haven't actually happened yet. For example, last week, Tamath Paliya Patiyah said in a regulatory filing that he would liquidate two of his SPACs also after failing to find a target and return $1.6 billion to investors. Bill Ackman also liquidated his vehicle. So it's just one after the other that is falling apart. Yeah, and I read an interesting stat yesterday that 40% of these SPAC companies are issuing going concern warnings. That means they might go out of business for their investors. And that's double the IPO rate. But I want to hone in on some news today. George Soros' son, well, he's been part of the SPAC movement as well. We got some details there. You can share with us. Yeah, so Bloomberg reported yesterday that the Everton Football Club spurred takeover interest from a SPAC led by George Soros' nephew that's according to people familiar with the matter. But there's no certainty yet whether the transaction will be closed, especially in this market where some deals are announced, but they don't actually follow through because the conditions are changing so rapidly. Yep, rapidly changing conditions. We've come to see this as the new norm. Yahoo, finances, Alex, Selenova, thank you for sharing that. Coming up, Black Gold getting a tailwind, Goldman's oil team stays with a bullish call for $100, $110 for Per Barrel on Brent.

2752,".... Welcome back the bold seam in control after the third quarter kicked off with a big two-day rally but a slew of economic data ahead could alter the market optimism and I want to get a quick check of the Wi-Fi interactive where we can see energy in the forefront today followed by communication services, tech and consumer discretionary. Those are at the top what you see in green. To the downside, utilities is down almost 2% followed by real estate and health care. All of those are defensive sectors and let's get a check of the majors now and we can see a mix board. Nasdaq just barely in the green by seven basis points. It's been fluctuating all day and then the Dow is down about one third of a percent and the S&P 500 down one fifth of a percent. So without further ado we want to talk about the current market action and that is with Kali Cox. She is E-Torrell's US investment analyst and Kali. Always great to see you here. We've done a number of webinars together and we've talked about some of the statistics in the S&P 500 and I think you and I were looking at some of the same data this week and what were you looking at? What were some of the conclusions that you came to? Yeah, dear. We were looking at some of the same data. I mean the rally we've seen so far this week or at least on Monday and Tuesday has been fierce. I think we can all agree on that. But it's so fierce, I mean it's the first time the S&P has rallied 2.5 percent or more and back-to-back days since December 2008 and you and I both ran the data, right? We see these kinds of rallies either deep in their market or in the first few days after a bull market starts which is the exact opposite to Nareo's there, right? And it just goes to show just how complicated this environment is for investors, how just the motion fueled and panicky it feels and it's quite a tough position to be in because we could be staring down to different paths here. And so investors who are nervous right now, what is your advice to them? Hopefully everybody's sitting on piles of cash but that's not necessarily the case. I know that I have a significant amount deployed. Got some on the sidelines here ready to be deployed. What are you telling your clients right now? Yeah, well it's interesting you say that because you've seen the sentiment and the sour moon that the market is in, I'd expect there to be more cash on the sidelines than then we think. But at the same time, we're telling our clients to really manage your emotions here, to understand where the market environment is but also the fact that it could be very costly to mess out on the first few days of a bull market. We really like a barbell strategy here holding on to some risk but being defensive at the same time. And where do you see the market opportunities when this market finally turns around? Hopefully it already has, maybe the lows in but that's not necessarily the sure bet right now. What kind of sectors or styles are you looking at? Yeah, well this market really is bottoming. We would expect to see more of an uptick and risk here, more of a surge in growth your assets here. We really like quality risks though at the moment. I mean, there are a lot of different flavors of growth stocks. We all know that with tech, you could look at the more speculative concept stocks or you could look at big tech. Everything big tech is a good example of quality risk with strong financials. And at the same time, we really like sickle-cooked here but we're feeling a little more cautious at the moment only because we don't know what the future holds for us here. And if we see growth deteriorate much more, we could see that reflected in sickle stocks. Ekele, I was writing our newsletter this morning. The morning brief, actually I wrote it yesterday afternoon for publication this morning but it was about those very same market statistics that you were talking about. After I ran the data and I saw kind of a mixed bag there, I kind of went off on a rant. And you know, you and I love to parse the data and look for things. Sometimes we don't always find an edge. Maybe you did. Maybe I didn't. But I think my message for investors is sometimes you just got to turn off the news. Not Yahoo Finance, of course, while you're watching this broadcast.

2753," But I think my message for investors is sometimes you just got to turn off the news, not Yahoo Finance, of course, while you're watching this broadcast, but you got to filter out the noise, just wondering what you're thinking about this as you also talk to some of your clients. Oh, it's so hard because it's so noisy these days and there are so many, you know, things you can look at to find that signal. And I mean, here, I do know I like person through data, you just said that, but I always try to remind people that, you know, when we see these big enough, you Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this Thursday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed on the market action as we head into the final hour of trading. Taking a look at the major averages, all three, the major averages in the red right now, starting with the Dow, the Dow off just around 375 points back below 30,000 in the Nasak off just around 6, 10th of a percent. S&P also moving to the downside off about 1% today, Russell 2000, the small cap index here, moving to the downside once again off just around 6, 10th of a percent. You look at the bond market, the yield of trending higher once again as we're seeing pressure in equities a 10 year yield up to six basis points to 382, the 30 year up to 3, 7, and 9. You look at the US dollar index that also trending to the upside now back above 112. So you look at some of the sector action this afternoon, a bit of a mixed picture. I guess you can say with energy, the only sector holding onto gains up just around 1.6 percent. But for the rest of the market, we really are seeing some pretty broad base selling real estate and utilities, the worst performer so far, of the day real estate and utilities both off just around 3 percent, Dave. Thank you, Sean. Let's get you up to speed now on the oil market still ingesting that historic cut from OPEC Plus that's bringing it as for a for the latest price action. Want to get your thoughts on some White House comments first, but what do we see in today? Yeah, that's right. So today we did see oil settle higher for the fourth straight day. And of course, after about 2 million barrel per day cut that was announced by OPEC Plus this week, Goldman Sachs now saying that it could see oil going up to as high as $110 per barrel in the first quarter, $1.15 by the first quarter of 2023. And if the cuts were to last through December,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,72,2022-10-06 19:03:30
2754," for barrel in the first quarter, one-fifteen by the first quarter of 2023. And if the cuts were to last through December of 2023, then you could see these elevated prices higher. And some analysts are saying this really goes to show you the gravity, sort of speak of how OPEC sees the possibility of a worldwide recession by cutting by this much. Now, some countries don't meet their quota already, so it's not necessarily two million barrels per day. But nonetheless, the only thing that would really drive prices lower were to be a serious recession. And we did see from 2008 to 2009, when you saw oil prices go from $145 per barrel all the way down to $35 in five months time. And I mentioned some comments from the White House. You know, as Amos Hockstein says, he doesn't think increased prices will be a result to this. He also said he thinks it's well below two million in actuality, closer to 900,000. And then he qualified that by saying, if there are any net cuts at all, he says some countries will cut, others will increase. What do you make of those comments? Yeah, that's right. So he's basically reiterating that some countries, as you mentioned, are not meeting their quotas. So you can't really say that it's two million barrels per day. Also talking about the SPR and that there is some space to release more of the reserve. Look, nonetheless, you did have officials from the White House basically saying that they're disappointed by this. They're disappointed by OPEX plus decision. And some analysts would say that it's as much of the decision about supply and demand as it is also a political decision because certainly this is a snub towards the US. Yeah, that visit and that fist bump with MBS certainly looks unproductive. In Esfere, thanks so much, appreciate that. Let's talk more about the markets with Jack Adlin, Crescent Capital, CIO and Founding Partner. Jack, always good to see you, sir. Big picture, the cuts from OPEX plus what do you mean for the markets? Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably suggest that the headline is a little more striking than actuality. I think you alluded to the fact that there are number of members that aren't meeting their current quota. So the net effect of this two million barrel drop is closer to five to 700,000 barrels a day. Still, we don't like to see production cuts, but it isn't as stark as what the headlines would suggest. Jack, looking at the broader market action today, all three of the major averages under pressure once again, we started the week on a very upbeat and I know with the Dow rallying 1,500 points in just two days, but we have now seen two days of selling. Where do you think we go from here? Is there more downside risk ahead? There can be, you know, really it's all about the 10-year treasury and it's all about the dollar. I think that if you looked at just the year-to-date performance of the S&P 500, it's virtually entirely explained by the move from 1 1,5% 10 year up to 375, 380 10 year. So I think that explains virtually to the decimal point, the move in the S&P 500. Now, of course, we're watching the dollar because it really signals how investors view the Fed. Once investors believe that there's light at the end of the tightening tunnel, we'll start to see the dollar peak and then start to roll over. In that case, I think then it's probably an all clear signal for equity investing and probably foreign stocks, non-dollar, denominated stocks will likely lead the way higher. But until that time, unfortunately, the 10-year treasury is really held hostage by the Fed. If they do believe that the market's rally too much and that the wealth effect could undermine their ability to fight inflation, guess what, they start selling treasury notes and push that rate higher. So I'm not necessarily banking on the rate yet. I think it's all about the Fed at the moment. And the Fed all about at the moment, tomorrow's jobs report, what do you think they need to see to change the narrative? Sure, unfortunately.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,73,2022-10-06 19:08:00
2755," at the moment. And the Fed all about at the moment tomorrow's jobs report, what do you think they need to see to change the narrative? Sure, unfortunately, the jobs report isn't really the big data point anymore. It's taken a backseat to the inflation data, but I'd like to see something that is consistent with what we saw with the jobs, the Jolts report, showing a million fewer job openings, and then the higher claims earlier today. If we see a jobs report that's consistent with that, perhaps lesser hiring, lower hourly hours worked, and the hourly wages slipping. I think that's a good sign, but still nothing's going to underscore the inflation until the inflation data comes out next week. Check another big thing for the markets next week is going to be earning season big banks starting to report their results. We certainly have seen estimates revised lower. What are you expecting from third quarter earnings season? I guess what do you think it's going to tell us just about the strength or the weakness of the equity markets here in the fourth quarter? Yeah, so I think this is certainly not a great environment for banks. We're heading into a downturn. The curve is inverted, so there's really no opportunity necessarily for net interest margin. We also have banks tightening their lending standards as they perhaps start to see some weakness among their borrowers. Then we've got a lot of the trading and buy out activity substantially lower. There aren't too many levers for the banks right now. The good news is I suppose bigger picture. Their capital positions are a lot stronger. We generally don't make the same big mistake twice in a row. Although we are watching some of the European banks to see how they're going to hold up in their stark economy moving into the next couple quarters. Yeah, looks ugly ahead and given all that, new favorite high quality companies who have grown their dividends over time. Do you have some examples of such? Sure. Again, there's nothing really too crazy, but Chevron, a great high quality company with a 3.8% or so of dividend yield. This is a company that's been growing. It's dividend at 5.3% annually for the last five years. So that's pretty strong. We've got general dynamics. Also, pretty nice sweet spot of the market. 2.99% dividend yield growing. It's dividend at 8.9% over the last five years. And then lastly, archer Daniels Midland, ADM, 1.9% dividend yield growing. It's dividend at about 4.5% annually. So pretty strong players in sectors of the market that are somewhat insulated from the vagaries of the economy right now. And we'll call it a no news as good news environment for these stocks. Check another big story. Another big concern here for investors. Really, for multi-national companies has been the strong dollar. We have the US dollar index back above 1.12 today. I guess how big of a risk do you see this being as we head into the final quarter of the year? Yeah, I've never seen. I don't think the market has seen the dollar strength and as strong as much in such a short period of time. And so when you start looking at global economies and global markets, that creates some dislocations that we don't know is going to happen. So part of the concern we have certainly is in emerging market debt perhaps, particularly that segment of the emerging market debt market that's denominated in US dollars. And other other economies, other central banks. So I think we see issues there. The good news is, though, fundamentally, the dollar is very expensive relative to many of our trading partners currencies. And so once we see, again, a peak in a fed tightening in that peak in the dollar, my guess is the next opportunity for risk taking. It's going to be in non-dollar markets like the Japanese yen or the EWJ for example could be an interesting play. All right, Jack Abel. And always great to talk to you. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us today. Thank you. Well, we are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live.

2756," I'm always great to talk to you. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us today. Thank you. Well, we are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live. Coming up, Peloton CEO says its latest round of job cuts is a quote, necessary step to save Peloton. And an analyst weighs in to tell us if he agrees. The deal is not done yet. Elon Musk and Twitter are still hammering out their $44 billion buyout agreement. Find out what the holdup is. And Adidas reviewing its deal with Kanye West, fellow streetwear investor, Shark Tankstar, Damon John, weighs in. Don't go anywhere. Peloton shares moving to the upside today. Up just around three and a half percent after announcing that it is cutting 500 more jobs. It's fourth layoff announcement of the year CEO, Barry McCarthy, telling the Wall Street Journal, quote, we need to grow to get the business to sustainable level here to talk about what that level could potentially look like. And the path forward for Peloton, we want to bring in Simeon Segal, BMO capital markets, managing a director and a senior analyst. Simeon, it's great to see you. So McCarthy, out saying that these cuts are necessary to put the company in a better position. I guess how do you see Peloton positioned right now? And is it in a position to return to growth? Hey, great to see you. Great to be here. I think that we need to incorporate or internalize the fact that Peloton has a great brand. It has a great community. But that doesn't necessarily mean it has room for growth at this point. And so I think what we're seeing now as a turnaround is just that much more difficult. We're watching incremental costs cuts, unfortunately, which are impacting people's lives. But it's also this decision to recognize that to get to profitability, the company needs to recalibrate. And so I think if we can focus on profitability as opposed to growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,75,2022-10-06 19:16:43
2757," back in people's lives. But it's also this decision to recognize that to get to profitability, the company needs to recalibrate. And so I think if we can focus on profitability as opposed to growth, I think there's a story. I think every time the focus is on trying to get a new member, there's going to be another drag. And now their fourth round of layoffs leaves them about half the number of employees they had at their peak. The interesting report also says McCarthy gives him six months to turn this around. If you're a betting man, what kind of chances do you give Peloton to turn it around in six months? Yeah, so fortunately, I'm not allowed to be a betting man right here. So that's the fact. So the fact that they say right now, it's an interesting point. So there were a few different articles out there today. One of them mentioned six months. One of them didn't. My understanding of the Peloton email that was sent out did not mention the six months. So but it's there. And that means we have to ask the question, what does that mean? And so I think that there's been so much of a conversation surrounding the fact that Peloton went from here to here really quickly. Now it's somewhere in the middle or somewhere down here. All the question there is what's the value? Is there an acquirer? And so I think the six month conversation started raising the question again of is there a point in which Peloton management says, you know, let's run a sale process? And that's I think the relevance in the interesting part of that six months nuance comment that you bring up. But we have to remember, even if the company decides they want to sell, it doesn't necessarily mean you have somebody who wants to buy. And I think what we have to still ask the same question, we've been asking it since February of 22 when people first started talking about are there acquirers? At the end of the day for a company that's watching it's the man falter and it's churned grow, does Peloton now that the company is cheaper, look more attractive? Or for these big tech companies that have been named as potential acquirers, wouldn't they have rather bought this company when it was on its way up when it was grabbing that mind share? So I think that it's very interesting. And the comments today are very interesting, raising, re-raising the question of, should emanate you on the table? But I think we still have to figure out just because they, even if they decide they want to put it up for sale, which they have certainly said they're not, do they find someone who wants to pick the stock up or the company up, given where it has come down to? Well, Sidney, what do you think? Because you obviously follow the company so closely, you've been an analyst tracking Peloton's every move now for quite some time. Do you think a sale is likely to be on the table at some point? Yeah, I think that it is hard. And the lesson I can obviously be wrong when it comes to this. But I think that at the end of the day, Peloton, as an entity, we've published a report noting that the downside, Leacy, it can be $5. And the thought process there is, if you have three million subscribers that become $2 million, because the churn goes up and because the people that bought during COVID aren't necessarily your best customers. So if you were, and again, not saying they will, but if you were to lose a third of your base at the current price, you can still just $5.5 stock. We have to internalize that still, right? We're still in the billions of market cap as we think about what that means. So for a company to come in and buy, you have to figure out what they're getting. And right now, what you're getting is an ongoing bleed of your members as opposed to a growth of your members. So I think what the company needs to do is convince themselves in the outside world whether they sell themselves or not, that they can find the bottom, that they can stabilize, that they can say we've got very strong, loyal brand, loyal brand people that are willing to pay are recurring $44 a month, and maybe even more. But the question is, what is that number? We don't know that yet. And I think every dollar that's spent trying to get someone new, rather than committed to focus on maintaining the people that are already involved, I think it's a dollar that's probably not that well spent. And I think that's what we're seeing. And so I think is there a value with where Peloton is worth, yeah, I'm not in the camp that Peloton is zero far from it. I think Peloton offers something very compelling and makes people very happy. But we need to figure out what that level is. And that's, I think, the question that's going on right now. And the companies you often read about, of course, the usual suspects, Apple, Amazon with more cash than most countries. And then of course Netflix, maybe on the undercard, does any of those make sense? So again, way out of my pay grade, but I think it's there to ask the question of, is Peloton in trouble more attractive to one of those companies, at a billion, two billion, three billion, four billion, versus Peloton doing really well at 10 to 15 billion? Because the companies you just mentioned are very large companies with very large market caps. And so what they rather is that incremental $10 billion, I know this sounds absurd, but it's the incremental $10 billion to catch a,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,76,2022-10-06 19:21:23
2758," Companies you just mentioned are very large companies with very large market caps. And so what they rather is that incremental $10 billion, I know this sounds absurd, is the incremental $10 billion to catch a falling knife more attractive than if they would have wanted it on the way up. I just, I think right now we're talking about this as a distressed asset. And the companies you just mentioned are looking for growth vectors. They're not looking to try and get something on the cheap unless they believe it's stable. So that's what I think the company has. I think for their standalone or for an acquisition they need to show they can be stable. Because until then you have to ask that question of what does NAPO really get at this point that they couldn't have gotten better off last year when they thought the trajectory was just going up into the right. So, I mean, what do you think it's going to take for Peloton's turnaround effort to really start to resonate with investors? Yeah, I think that's an excellent question. And I think well, he is all about perspective and where we start from. I think if we internalize what the company did, they went from zero to several billion dollars. That is a tremendous achievement in a very short amount of time. The problem is in between them, they went to 50 billion dollars. And so at the end of the day, it's hard to argue that it's not resonating with investors. It's just not resonating with the investors the way it did over the last few years. And that's been effectively the reason we've had the celebrating. But I do think right now it is still a very, it's valued at a very large business. A lot of the companies that went public later than they did. A lot of companies that are younger than they did have watched up and down as well. So I think for them to get people back on board, people need to be able to create the bottom. I know I've said a few times and it's this idea that once you can create the stable, once you can create the trough, you can start building back up and figure out where you're going to go. But people need to figure out his Peloton growth story or they just a very nice business. And then there's nothing wrong with being a very nice business. But that gets me to that $5 of earnings, which is so much lower than where we are right now. Or sorry, $5 share price. So that's I think this element of figuring out the identity. Every time we hear about another ongoing cut, it makes people think, well, maybe I'm not at the bottom yet. Maybe I don't know where we are. And I think that's the next shoe to drop. We have to find out what the churn starts looking like over the next year. So I think there's still a lot of questions. Indeed, there are. Simeon Siegel answered a lot of them for us from BMO. Appreciate that good stuff. All right. The new developments now in the Twitter Elon Musk saga. The Wall Street Journal reporting that the two sides could reach a deal by Monday. And right now the talks are focused on financing and litigation. That timeline would also have heard a deposition from Elon Musk, which had been delayed until then. The goal it appears from both sides is to stay the Delaware Chance Record trial, which is slated to start on October 17th. And a court filing Elon Musk as the deal could close on or around October 28th. Stay tuned.

2759," People is This time for triple play, three socks that were watching in the final 30 minutes of trading Pinterest, Tesla and Uber. Let's kick it off with my pick and that is Pinterest. Goldman, upgrading the stock to a buy, lifting its price target to $31 a share and playing 25% upside for the stock. And what they call a more positive risk-reward skew. Now, analyst Eric Shardin is optimistic about Pinterest's efforts to grow its user base and also increase monetization, writing in a note to clients that, quote, despite some uncertainty in the near term, we see Pinterest as positively levered to a number of long-term secular growth themes. Now, those seems, including engagement and ad that spend shifting online, also social commerce and the creator economy. Pinterest shares more than 30% in the past three months, but year to date still well in the red. Off just over 40%. So, Jared, we have Goldman getting a little bit more bullish on Pinterest. You can't help but wonder how much of a valuation call this is with the stock off so significantly since it started the year. I think so, Shana. Pictures worth a thousand words. Let's go to the Wi-Fi Interactive where I have a max chart going back to their IPO date. Late 2019, actually, this is just the last three years. If we put a max there, we go. We can see all the way back to 2019. Anyway, we got this Brian Sasi bulging bicep pattern as he likes to call it, but as you can see, no lie, we do a lot of this on the morning show. You should check it out sometimes. There is a rounded bottom here that the stock has been making all year long. 28 looks like a maker break. Level for me, it's right there. A lot of times you might see a little bit of a dip. That would be a massive saucer and handle formation that I'm tracking right there. But I do want to move on because I am looking at the EV space and we have Mizzou making, and actually cutting its price target on Tesla and Neo, though it did keep the firms by ratings on both. Once after the two automakers posted their latest production and delivery data, analysts are still saying strong demand is China moves to electrify and he characterized a quarter and it September as being quote, mostly in line as supply and logistics remain a challenge. Now Mizzou lowered its Tesla target to $370 from $391 in change, noting that effects headwinds. Read the Soring Dollar could weigh on quarterly revenue estimated to be $22.5 billion. From now see, Neo stock, by the way, trading to $40 instead of 42. Let me pull up the Wi-Fi Interactive here one more time where I have our heat map. I'm going to check on Neo first. Let's pull that up. This is a year-to-date chart. You can see mostly range bound since about March of this year, although it did have that big decline earlier. You pull up a max chart going to its IPO date on the IPO date at the New York Stock Exchange in 2018. This has been a slow, steady downtrend right here, not really breaking that trend line, so have a little bit more work to do on a breakout basis. Then take a look at Tesla here. I'm going to narrow this to the last five years. I just want to show the massive consolidations that we oftentimes have in this stock. We are in the midst of another one, have you had to break out of this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,78,2022-10-06 19:29:50
2760," I'm gonna narrow this to the last five years. And I just wanna show the massive consolidations that we oftentimes have in this stock. We are in the midst of another one to have you have to break out of this play either Dave. Jared, you did not explain what the dip bicep is. Is that the blickery bicep? Oh, wow. Is that a fire? Is that a subtle dig here at my chart? Pattern naming authority, or is that a dig on my bicep? I don't know, Dave. What was it bulging bicep pattern? That's what Saazi calls it. A lot of his stocks that have roundtripped their gains throughout the pandemic. That is a big thing. We need to start incorporating that into the show daily. So I'm out bulging bicep pattern. You guys trade market. I will NFT it. We're gonna be rich. There we go. That's all we need tonight. I will stay in the automobile space. My place, Uber, no shortage on the right-hailing giant this week. First, nearly two years after selling its autonomous vehicle research, you that they are back in that space. Uber is sounding a 10-year multi-market deal, a joint venture between Hyundai and Appteve for autonomous cars on both. It's right-hailing and Uber Eats delivery app. That's the key there. Trips are expected to start later this year. We're not exactly sure where, but based on regulations in California, you might expect Florida and Texas to be the first two markets. Also on Wednesday, Uber's former head of security was found guilty by a federal jury in San Francisco of attempting to cover up a data breach that actually saw tens of millions of both customer and driver records stolen. How does it all come out? The wash Uber shares up by more than 2% on the day, but as you know, it has been a struggle those far this year, still down more than 30% year to date, John. Yeah, Dave, looks like investors are a little bit encouraged about the autonomous news. It's interesting what we've seen come from a lift in Uber in this space because both have changed plans as they've been under pressure to more so focus on profitability rather than taking some of these costly chances. So this is an interesting play because it gives Uber some exposure in this space, but it doesn't have to pour all that money into its own research and development to get that exposure. So we'll see whether or not this partnership does in fact pay off. All right, coming up next. At a time when the stock market remains extremely volatile, our next guest explains why you should be investing in the space economy.

2761," massively effective razorure laser magazine. After not some around the world are en route to the International Space Station following a Wednesday launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The crew five mission is the sixth flight for the joint endeavor between Elon Musk's SpaceX and NASA, the mission commander by the way in this flight. Nicole Mann, she is the first ever Native American to travel to space. But what about the space investment space? Andrew Chanan is the Pro Cure AM founder and CEO here as part of our ETF report brought to you by Invesco QQQ. Good to see you, Andrew. We do want to talk about the ETF space, but what significant progress has SpaceX made? So what we're seeing is roughly a launch every week, which is something that is quite unheard of and the pace at which they're sending these satellites up is something that is both an opportunity as well as a concern that needs to be managed as far as space debris goes in the future. But what they're doing is really pushing the space industry forward significantly and it's creating many opportunities for numerous companies throughout the industry. Andrew, speaking of the many opportunities for companies within the industry, what is this through those two investor excitement when you're trying to get investors excited about investing in space is something like this type of space. You know, I think we saw two launches yesterday and expecting a third today. You know, one of it is extremely interesting because Elon Musk is essentially sending a Russian cosmonaut to the ISS. The first time that this has happened on from US soil in decades. So with all of the tensions that we see geopolitically seeing that space is still able to drive forward despite ongoing hostilities. This is something that shows how cooperative the industry is. But when they're sending up these satellites, you have to think about satellite manufacturers and operators. You know, parts, manufacturers for what goes into these. At the same time because they're sending up so many satellites, it's drying up the supply of launches from what space X can provide, well creating opportunities for other launch companies, many of which happened to be in the UFO ETF that are now going to see other clients potentially stepping forward for launch needs, which is something where this rising tide seems to be lifting a lot of ships here. Indeed it is. Nice analogy there. You have three reasons to invest in the space economy. What are the Andrew? You know, it's constantly changing, but one thing that we notice again with the with the Russian Ukrainian conflict going on right now is how important space is from a military standpoint. And from the early days of the invasion, satellites were actually providing us with the imagery showing the Russian troop buildup on the border. And as we've seen the different issues with one website satellites being held hostage and rocket parts not being sent from Russia due to sanctions, there creates all this need for non-Russian companies and allied countries to create these types of solutions that are needed for the space industry. And because space is so key for militaries, we're seeing a tremendous amount of spending coming from militaries and governments around the world. So the percentage of what is being spent from space coming from governments is slowly starting to increase, which is certainly encouraging. But there's also technological changes like reusable rockets that are significantly lowering the cost of entry to space. So we're at a technological turning point, which is extremely exciting. But also so many other technologies that we use utilize space. So transformative technology. And so, we're seeing a lot of things that we're seeing in the space. And so, we're seeing a lot of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,80,2022-10-06 19:38:39
2762," space. So we're at a technological turning point, which is extremely exciting. But also so many other technologies that we use utilize space. So transformative technologies like 5G, the internet of things, it connected devices, even cryptocurrency and cloud computing are starting to rely on space. So if you're looking at any of these industries and you're looking for companies that are literally operating as the digital data, told keepers for this digital data superhighway, space companies become extremely critical for that. Andrew speaking about all the money that's being spent within this industry, what do you think is the growth trajectory for this sector here, looking out over the next five to 10 years? So we're not allowed to make projections, but we can look at various research houses that do put out numbers and Morgan Stanley believes that we're looking at potentially a $1.7 trillion space economy by 2040. Think of America, Merrill Lynch has come out saying north of $2 trillion by 2045. So there are varying estimates, but one of the large reasons that people believe that this industry will continue to grow, it comes from the communication side. So broadband internet connectivity, Elon Musk is sending up basically double the amount of satellites that were in orbit as of two years ago, just in the last year or so. So we're seeing new industries emerge, other industries really starting to heat up, and this is something that hopefully could be a benefit for the broader industry as whole. All right, Andrew Chan, and always great to have you. Thanks so much. Thanks for having me. Dave? All right, some breaking news now, Shana, and some big for the cannabis space. President Biden announcing moments ago, the administration will pardon all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. This folks is a major step toward decriminalization, most believe. Cannabis stocks are jumping at the news. You can see Aurora, Canopy, Curly, Green Thumb, Truleaf, all flying on this news, in particular, Truleaf up 33. Green Thumb 26, Curly, the leader in the space, climbing towards 40% up on this news because of presumed optimism of federal legalization by the instructing health and human services secretary, Xavier Bissera, to initiate a review on how marijuana is scheduled under federal law. Currently, marijuana is a schedule one drug designated for the most dangerous substances on the same level as heroin and LSD, pot stocks, flying on this news. Interesting to digest the other next couple of days and see if there really is optimism towards federal legalization. We've still heard zero Republicans to date in the Senate support any legislation, even safe banking, which has passed the House six times and cannot get out of the Senate. And that does not have to do with federal legalization, just rather the banking space. Shana, it's interesting to see this kind of optimism. It is. It's very interesting to see this kind of optimism, especially when you take a look at how the stocks are reacting to this. And I think they have been waiting for this sort of ruling here or some sort of statement from the White House, from the administration in terms of their plans here, how they are going to deal with some of those offenses. So the fact that we are getting this news, we're seeing the reaction and some of the largest players in this space, David, the roar of just around five and a half percent, Curlyf rallying. Look at that. Up 29% now, 30% green thumb. Truly, if you're all have a massive move to the upsides of the catalyst, I think that this sector has been waiting for for quite some time. Yeah, I'll just be honest here. I mean, this business has been waiting for anything optimistic. I don't know that this changes the equation at all, but I understand that they've been waiting for any sort of good news in this industry. Coming up next, we're going to, we're going to check in with on real estate mortgage rates headed in the right direction. A real surprise turnaround. I'll be at slight good news. We'll also take a look at the rental market ahead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,81,2022-10-06 19:42:30
2763," MUSIC A sliver of good news for potential home buyers today is mortgage rates falling slightly after rising for six straight weeks. The 30 year fixed falling to 6.66%. As you can see on the screen from 6.7 a week ago, that's according to Freddie Mac and their chief economist attributing the drop to quote ongoing economic uncertainty. Rate still over more than double what they were one year ago. In practical terms, that means an average monthly mortgage more than $1,000 per month more than this time last year on a $500,000 loan. Meanwhile, the median monthly mortgage rate is up $800 just since January. A little bit more context, current rates will actually cost perspective buyers around $100,000 in actual home buying power compared to a year ago. Overall though, the story remains unchanged. New listings fell for the 13th straight week. They are down 17% from a year ago. Homes are sitting on the market for longer by an average of six extra days compared to a year ago. The projection still suggests we will see 7% mortgage rates in the 30 year fixed before we'll see 6.5. Obviously, mortgage rates do not rise and fall directly with Fed action more tied to the 10 year, but needless to say, if the Fed goes for another 75 point hike, which they are expected to, we will see rates continue to climb, Shawna. All right, Dave. Let's stick with housing here and take a look at what's happening in the rental market. As inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty are hitting that market pretty hard and your report from real payments, you found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first a three-key drop that we've seen in 30 years. We want to bring in Jay Perth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,82,2022-10-06 19:47:06
2764," Hitting that market pretty hard and your report from real page you found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first a three-q drop that we've seen in 30 years. We want to bring in Jay Parsons, head of the economics industry principles at real page. Jay, it's great to see you. So very unusual for us to see a drop here in the third quarter, which is typically very strong three-month time frame for the rental market. What do you think is behind this massive drop that we saw? Yeah, so I think the first thing I was looking for is signs of affordability concerns, given the number of, given the rate, the rent increases that occurred over the last couple of years. But that's just not showing up. Wages are still up. Rent collection is still very high. In fact, they actually up year over year. And we're not seeing any kind of move down into cheaper units and cheaper areas. And so really what appears to be happening is a freeze in household formation because there's very little leasing traffic right now. And obviously we know people aren't buying houses right now. So it tells me that people are kind of in a weight and sea mode. And they've really pushed the pause button on their housing search for the time being. The pause button. Is that how you describe the entire housing sector at the moment? And is that because of mortgage rates? It seemed like buyers and sellers have back to your word paused. Yeah, no, I think, you know, obviously for renters, it's not necessarily mortgage rates directly, but it's those same kind of underlying factors that are driving up mortgage rates. And that's really inflation, you know? You know, we've been talking a lot about home prices and rents, but you know, one thing everyone feels every day is groceries. I mean, they're up 13% year over year. And so I think with overall inflation, we're seeing consumer confidence is way down. And you think about it, you know, when you don't feel certain about the economy and your place in it, your financial situation, human nature is to weight it out, weight and sea. And so, you know, thankfully, as you know, the job market remains strong for the time being on employment slow. And so that tells me that there's a lot of pent up demand being built up right now. So if the job market remains strong, I do think demand will come back, but it's certainly not happening right now. Jay, how long until you think that demand does return to the rental market? Yeah, good question. So these next few months, you know, winners slow period for housing of all types. You know, you don't see a lot of people moving around in the winter months. And so we really won't know much until early spring. So I think the time we get to out March, we should see that demand come back. Now, of course, if the job market turns, it could be a very different story, but at this point, I would expect to see a lot of that, particularly for rentals. I think we'll see rental demand come back first around that timeframe. What's the inventory story in the rental market? So we saw a huge drop off in vacancies in 2021, record apartment demand, record single felony rental demand. We peaked on occupancy rates in March. It has gotten a little better for renters out there. There's a little more availability. It's still low. You know, while there was weak apartment demand in Q3, it's still a very tight market. We have very low vacancy right now. We have high retention rates, but we, it's gotten a little bit better. And I think the good news for renters as well is we're gonna see a lot of new inventory next year. We're seeing 40 year highs in apartment construction. We're seeing a large number of single family rental communities, build-strength communities are being built. We've even heard of home, home sellers. We're now choosing to wrap their homes with a way out the mortgage market. And so there's definitely more inventory and I think we'll see more next year as well. Jay, what does this do to prices? I guess that there's more inventory and more options on the table. Are we gonna go and you see a pretty big drop then in rentals? I don't think we're gonna see an issue drop in rents from most parts of the country. I think we could see some seasonal cuts here in the winter months, but nothing dramatic and drastic. But I think we can see it more importantly, though, I think we're gonna see a big moderation in rent growth next year. And to be honest, we've already seen that. I mean, the certainly the CPI does not reflect this. And most of the big rent hikes occurred in 2021. And in 2022, we've really seen more moderate rent increases. And I think we're gonna see a kind of more of them return to normal in terms of rent growth next year. All right, Jay Parsons, great to get your take. Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for having me. Come out next, Google, unveiling a slew of new products today, including its first ever Pixel Smartwatch, all the details next. Nytera smiles. Scoot, Scoot Alright.

2765," Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Google unveiling a new flagship phone to the Pixel 7 and showing off its first ever smartwatch at an event earlier. Dan Halley is here with the breakdown of the new products. Dan, you were able to get your hands on these new products at the event earlier today. What do you think? The big news is the Pixel Watch. This is Google's first party smartwatch. They have made the Wear OS or Android Wear operating system before. Those have been used by the likes of Fossil, Michael Cours, Samsung to build smartwatches. None of them really looked all that fancy though. We're talking about the Michael Cours stuff. It's their own style of smartwatch. It looks incredibly elegant when you see it in person. It's a circular design. It's got these large bezels on it, but you can't really see it that much. So it just feels like the text is floating there in space. It's a 41 millimeter watch face itself. So just to give you a sense of what that means. The standard Apple Watch is 41 millimeters and then there's 45 millimeters for the larger size. This is going to fit on anybody's wrist that might be a little bit smaller. My wife, for instance, has a small wrist and that looks totally great on her. I tried it on and it looks great on me too. But everything does. I think that this is going to be something that is going to help get Android smartwatches up to speed with what Apple's been doing. Because Apple has just been straight crushing it for years. So this is potentially a way for them to get in. That's interesting because I didn't know how I would feel. But full disclosure, I'm not an Android user. So I'm not necessarily having ventured in to their products. What do you think of the phone now? The phone is really interesting. So it's basically pure Google. It's their design, their take on the software. What they think the software should be. The big stand out here is a camera. The one with the third little dot there, that's the pro. That has an ultra wide angle. An angle, a standard camera. Then it can do two times optical zoom, five times optical zoom equivalent, five times actual optical zoom, and then ten times optical zoom equivalent using different types of cropping. So it looks great. I mean, you're going to be able to see things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to zoom into with other phones.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,84,2022-10-06 19:55:12

I'm a big Apple watch believer, so I don't know, I'm a little skeptical. All right, Dan Halley, thanks so much for bringing that down, Russ. Dave? And yes, everything looks good on Dan Halley. That's a big thing. Oh yeah, of course. No one's arguing with that. Don't forget. Google speaking of recently closed its $5 billion dollar buyout of cybersecurity firm, Mandient and the companies, now sounding off on it. Yahoo, finances, Ali Garfinkle here with what's next for Google and their cyber strategy. Hi there, Ali, what are you hearing? Hi Dave, great to see you. So Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil Venables sounded off this morning this afternoon, actually. And the message I was getting was really clear. Google cybersecurity ambitions are massive. This deal, as big as it is, also massively increased their threat intelligence capabilities. So they want to get this right. And I would say there are two important things for a member here. First, this is happening in a moment when cybersecurity risk is higher than ever. That's what experts have been telling me. And it makes sense that in this environment, we're seeing Google really shore up its cybersecurity position. But also the other thing too, and the second thing, the thing I'm watching is that this is their biggest deal in 10 years. It's even bigger than actually Fitbit, which actually made those watches possible in part. And I'm looking for Google to spotlight this going forward. We could see that as soon as next week, when the Mandient Deal is reportedly set to be a big part of Google Cloud's major event. So that's what I'm looking for here. All right, good stuff, Ali. Garfinkel, excuse me, I appreciate you joining us with that. Stick with us here on Yahoo Finance Live.

2767," All right, just a couple of minutes to the closing bell. Let's bring in Jared Blyckery with a chance to check out these markets as they are little red on the board. Hey, Jared. Little red on the board, but we're going to redeem ourselves here with an interesting look at the cannabis sector. But first, we do have markets under pressure down over 1% Sozi S&P 500, Nasdaq down 3 quarters of a percent in the Russell 2000, a little bit less than that. Let's skip straight to the action. This is the cannabis heat map that we have working here. We can see a number of issues up over 30% a lot of these Canadian issues, but also Tilray, the American ADRs traded almost 30% right now. CGC canopy up 20%. This is after Biden proposes to decriminalize, not decriminalize. Basically, it's a get out of jail free card for anybody who's been arrested for possession. Hope that goes through in the States. Take it up as well. Besides that, we are seeing a lackluster day in the stock action. Energy in the forefront, we see crude oil topping $88 per barrel to the downside. Utilities, real estate extending their losses, both of those off more than 3%. Pretty defensive sectors, so not really getting too worried about that. But we will take a look at the travel sector as we head into the frozen bell. And here we go. Another day of declines as we wrap up the training day, all three of the major averages ending in the red, the Dow off 300 and 47 points as we shake out the final trades of the day, S&P off just around 1% NASDAQ off about 7% of a percent. The sector action, energy, the only sector closing the day in positive territory, the worst performers on the flip side, real estate and utilities, both of those sectors off just over 3%. All right, let's make sense of the action that we saw today. And for that, we want to bring in Matt Stucky, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, Senior Portfolio and Strategist. And we have Jeremy Schwartz, Wisdom Tree, Global Chief Investment Officer, great to see both of you. Matt, let me start with you just in terms of the equity moves that we're seeing today. Once again, another day of declines coming off a very strong start to the week. What do you think of the action that we've seen over the past four days? Well, good afternoon. Thanks for having me on the show. I think this is just really a continuation of what we've been dealing with all year in terms of an elevated volatility profile for the market. The market is hanging on to every kind of whiff of inflation reports out there. Good reports are being met with relief rallies in the market while hot reports on inflation are just furthering the pain and increasing volatility even further. And we have a job support this tomorrow morning, which we'll wait and see how it looks. But it's just going to be another data point that markets are going to probably trade off of significantly as we look to see how the employment market is functioning here. Jeremy, do we learn more from the strong start to the week in the quarter or the last two days in the pullback? You know, we've all been bond traders as Matt was talking about where it's all pivoting on rates and the Fed and sort of you had rates fall. It started with the Bank of England stepping in to support the markets and the bond markets. Now, it was already a temporary measure. So the question is do they think things can go beyond that? I do think sentiment was very washed out. So there was an element of just sentiment being so negative that there was some measure saying sentiment was from a zero to 100 goes out as zero. And so can you go up from there? So I do think there was some relief rally from that relief from bond pressure coming off. We do think the Fed should pivot in their November meeting. We think they should go more like 50 instead of 75. But we'll see, you know, as the next month comes, is true. That would be another further catalyst for the beginning part of this week in the last few days. It's true.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,86,2022-10-06 20:04:23
2768," or catalyst for the beginning part of this week than last few days. But it's certainly all trading off of what's happening in the bond market is the key driver here. And Jeremy, how are you, I guess how are you managing some of the risk there in the bond market? Because we certainly have seen a ton of action, 10-year yield up once again today, up another six basis points to 381. How are you adjusting your portfolio as a result? Yeah, we manage model portfolios for and help give some guidance to clients on how do we think about that. We've been very underweight duration for a while. And coming into the year, yields were so low there was just no cushion to offset any rising rates. This is the first quarter where we've sort of upped our duration. So we have two strategies, one is the floating-reachered U.S. of FAR. It's been the best play for rising fed. We've also had a yield enhanced core, AGGY, which is just a little bit longer duration than the ag. We sort of moved some from the floating-reachered to the yield enhanced core at our recent rebalance across a lot of our models. We're still underweight duration. We're saying we're not ready to fully join the duration party. We're still short duration versus our benchmarks. But we sort of cut the gap in half because we do now think yields are very different. You've got a few hundred basis points increase in real yields. There's really now yield back in fixed income. The high yield market, you get 8 to 9% yields. So it's just a very different story than what you started the year. And so we did cut that duration gap in half in a lot of our model portfolios. And Matt, you said you still expect a couple of elevated CPI reports based on the back of housing Y. And what are you seeing overall in the housing sector that gives you a sense of where the entire economy might be headed? Yeah, this is a really critical point to make here about housing is that housing flows into CPI with about a year and a half lag. So what you're seeing in CPI right now in the services component, a third of which is housing is what we saw in the housing market in 2021. And we all remember what housing looked like last year where annualized gains were 20% or higher. But it's a very completely different story as we look at what the housing market looks like this year. From where we started this year up until this week, mortgage purchase demand is off 37%. And the month on month gains in the housing market are history. We've gone from a month on month gains of 1 1 1 2% to negative territory over the summer. And considering where affordability is and where mortgage rates have been trending this quarter, it's likely that we're going to see further declines. And so that's going to take some time to filter into overall headline inflation and core inflation. But the question is, is whether policymakers at the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world will look to more of a forward looking indication of where inflation is going, not the stale inflation that we're likely to see, which is going to be elevated for the next couple of quarters because, again, housing moves into the numbers with about a year to year and a half lag. Matt, given all the uncertainty that you were just talking about in the market, some of the challenges that investors are facing right now, what do you like? That's a good question. I think the diversification is your best friend and volatile markets. And we agree with Jeremy that a lot of value has been restored into the bond market. And so while it's been a painful reprise this year, invests with great corporates around a five-year mark or trading between five and a half percent, that provides you some cushion against traditional equities. Within equities, the position we've had for the last couple of years is to be tilting our portfolios towards cheaper parts of the market. And we think that's still an attractive place to be invested. Value spreads continue to be historically wide. And so if you think that a recession is coming in 2023 and our base cases that we do have some sort of a mild recession, there's a lot of cushion already built into the price. A sector neutral value implementation, the large cap space, trades less than nine times for looking earnings. And so even if estimates get cut significantly for that basket of equities that I just mentioned, you still have a lot of cushion because it's only, like I said, nine times earnings. All right, good stuff. Matt Stuckie, Jeremy Schwartz, appreciate you both being here. Wonderful breakdown there. Coming up the best drama in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,87,2022-10-06 20:08:57
2769," Thanks. All right. Good stuff. Matt Stucki, Jeremy Schwartz. Appreciate you both being here. A wonderful break down there. Coming up, the best drama in the world of business, the latest in the Elon Musk Twitter saga right after a short break. Good food. All right, the latest in the juicy Asalga in the business world, that of course, the back and forth between Elon Musk and Twitter will he or won't he? Elon's lawyers now asking a Delaware court to halt the upcoming trial, which starts October 17th over his deal to acquire Twitter at 5420 per share. We have senior reporter for the Wall Street Journal Carol Lamartha with us to discuss what's next in this deal. Caraguthus here, you've been all over this deal. Will we see Elon Musk deposed as early as Monday? That's currently the big question. I think that's why the two sides are deep in talks. They're hoping to, I believe, reach an agreement before them. I don't think either side wants to go through with that at this point, but still a possibility as of this moment. Karen, you've done some reporting here. You're now saying that Elon Musk reporting that Elon Musk is now saying that he wants this all contingent on whether or not he receives the necessary jet financing. What can you tell us about that? And I guess just a likelihood or unlikely, that that's going to happen, given how different the market is today compared to how it was when you initially struck this deal. So that wasn't a condition of the initial deal, but interestingly when his lawyers sent a two sentence letter to Twitter on Monday, surprising us all and saying, let's just do the deal on the original terms, he threw in this new financing condition. And so that is where the talks this week have really centered around. Now as far as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,88,2022-10-06 20:13:07
2770," the deal on the original terms, he threw in this new financing condition. And so that is where the talks this week have really centered around. Now, as far as the idea of the banks having an out, that is not something I'm hearing and awful lot about. I think that would be very unlikely. They have a reputational risk. They would need to deal with it. They were to try to pull out of this deal. I think it's more that it's just another bargaining chip for him in these negotiations at the moment. How short are estimates that Elon Musk, how short is he of the 5420 per share? How much Tesla shares do we figure he may have to sell? That's a great question. He's already sold a large chunk, as you know. And to finance his equity portion, he's personally on the hook for over $30 billion worth of equity. Now he has a few friends and business acquaintances that have agreed to help with that. But they're not obliged to do it the way he is. So he may need to sell even more shares at the end. Kira, what's your best guess just in terms of whether or not this does go to trial? How long could potentially take to close and whether or not you have confidence? That it will, in fact, close and go through this time. So right now, the two scenarios that I think people are looking at are the following. One, they could reach a deal this weekend ahead of Monday, in which they agreed to put the lawsuit on hold and hopefully close the deal by the end of the month. The other scenario involves they don't reach a deal. They go to trial. That's five days starting the week after next. We'll probably get a decision within a few weeks. You would assume that if the decision is bad for Musk, he would probably appeal it. That would take a few additional weeks. We would probably have clarity by the end of the year. But then we'd still need to hold a potential vote on it if any of the terms changed or get all the conditions in place for the deal to close. So that would be a much more drawn out close. Any sense if Elon is still trying to reduce this deal from the $54.20, the $44 billion price tag? So that's an excellent question. As you know, we reported before his letter on Monday saying let's just do it at the original price. They were in deep discussions about a price cut. So anytime there's negotiating going on between two sides, I just assume any term is any possible term changes still on the table. I wouldn't rule it out as things move around, but I haven't heard that it's a focus of the discussions as they stand today. Karen, we've been following your reporting very closely. We will continue to follow it. Thanks so much for having on with us and giving us the latest. Karen Lombardo, the Wall Street Journal.

2771,"és Well, if you're in the market for a Ford F-150 Lightning EV, the task is getting tougher and the price tag higher, Ford raising the price. The second time in as many months, this week by $5,000, the starting price now, $519,740, up 11% from the previous price hike and 30% more than in May of 21. Senior Auto's reporter, Prouds, who remaining here with more on this story, Prouds, good to see you. What are we learning? Dave, you mentioned that second price hike there for that base model, the Ford F-150 Lightning EV. Ford announced that truck had a sub-40,000 price tag, a shot across the bow to the industry that we can make this truck for cheap. But you know what, it seems like things are getting in the way, namely inflation. I spoke to an auto analyst named Sam Fiorani at AutoFourCast Solutions. He's a big car manufacturing expert. He told me that Ford had no choice but to do this. It wasn't sustainable for them with inflation and part shortages. He said it was an in-ocertune time when Ford came out. He said, I'm from F-150 Lightning because of the fact that we started having inflation hit the economy. You know, you can't, you also, you said you can't blame Ford here because it's not an execution problem. GM and Tesla also having problems at pricing. We saw Tesla Royce prices. We saw GM say that their Ford Equinox is not, I'm sorry, there are seven Equinox. It's not going to be below 30, but around $30,000. So, you know, you can't actually blame Ford here because of what's happening as an industry by a problem. But there is a silver lining here and he said that perhaps by raising prices, Ford can actually invest in their EV transition more fully. And then also potentially, we might be able to see cheaper EVs down the road. But you know, it's hard to say right now to Ford F-150 Lightning Reservation holders were going to see a bigger price tag when they finally get that truck. Yeah, with that demand, they've got a lot of pricing power there. Prowse, thank you. Shana. All right, Dave, access to funding and concerns about credit availability are two big challenges. Minority business owners are facing today. And so, according to a new report from Bank of America and Shark Tank's Damon John is looking to help his announced plans for the third annual Black Entrepreneurs a day that will feature big names, including Spike Lee, Venus Williams and Shaqille O'Neill. We want to bring in Damon John, the Shark Group, a CEO and founder of Black Entrepreneurs Day. Damon, it's great to see you. Once again, and have you back here on Yahoo Finance. Congratulations on the announcement that you made today, the third annual Black Entrepreneurs Day. Just give us a sense right now. This of course happening later this month at a time when the economy is slowing down, business conditions are changing very rapidly. Give us a sense of just what you're hearing from business owners and entrepreneurs today. Yeah, I think, I mean, listen, you report and I'm hearing it a lot from watching you. You know, with inflation and everybody being squeezed and we're just looking at the challenges with Ford Tesla and everybody else. The supply chain is still being somewhat bottlenecked and figured out. It's getting tougher out there. You know, and that's the challenge and that's why as I launched Black Entrepreneurs Day for the third year, it's about access to capital and it's about more information on how to operate a business these days because we still have to start cutting and the cutting is not over.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,90,2022-10-06 20:22:09
2772," the day for the third year, it's about access to capital and it's about more information on how to operate a business these days because we still have to start cutting and the cutting is not over. I think we have a we have some time to keep cutting because these prices in inflation and the supply chain is problematic. Yeah, shocking. A day to see 40% of black business owners say they think they'll never have equal access to capital. Is that problem getting better and the people that might be at your conference? Shaquille O'Neill, Venus let alone her sister Serena Spike Lee, how are they changing that atmosphere? Well, it is somewhat getting better in one sense, but on the flip side, you know, it's not. You know, a lot of people, a lot of corporations after George Floyd had donated a lot of funds and it was an internal mandate to go out there and to address some of these matters. That's why we love working with JP Morgan Chase, Walter Management and they have their criteria as to deploy 30 billion over the next couple of years, but a lot are pulling back, you know, they're pulling back because they're looking at these things in line item. I'm not taking it personally. They're saying, hey, if we got to reduce our, you know, a lot of stuff we're doing by 30%. Well, something like these type of programs, they're just looked at as line item. They cut them when we always say that the people who need the most get cut the first and that's something that needs to, that needs to be readdressed because when more issues come around, they're going to be the ones with their pants down and the press and a lot of people are holding them, you know, holding them to their word of what did you say about two years ago? Now, why should Kilo Neal Spike Lee and Venus are honest to have people identify with people who are in great positions, but to talk more about their losses and where they failed and how they overcame those things and how they had to continue to educate themselves because many of us African Americans did not come from what legacy wealth. So our parents and grandparents could not share this information or wanting to, you know, scale back and deal with tough times like this. And David, talking about empowering these business owners, showing them what success looks like. I guess, how do you better prepare them for the future? We talk about the fact that access to funding is so, is so tough for many minorities that the numbers are pretty drastic, just the gap between access to funding. Guess what do we need to do in order to close that gap? Well, the challenges, what you need to do is any entrepreneur, whether African American or not is you have to constantly educate yourself on how to improve your business. And often that is the structure of your business. A lot of times when I meet with entrepreneurs, they literally cannot take in the capital because they don't have quick books or they don't have other sources so I can really trace where the money came from and where my money is going. A lot of times is internal structure and then it's always like any other business going back to what is the core of your business. I know, you know, I believe that we should always spend 20% on looking forward into improving the business and then, but at times like this, you need to go full out on who is your customer, why are you and how you offer providing for them? Where can you cut the fat and make it through these times? You get as lean as possible. You have a restaurant stop becoming a ghost kitchen in various other things like that. And you got to recalibrate your business because you got to get lean right now because winter is coming. You built the iconic clothing brand Foubu. Another icon, frankly, has been Kanye West, what he's done with Yeezy up 30% in 21.1 billion to a deed is alone, let alone his partnership with Gap. He's been very critical of both those relationships, Damon. And today we learned from the Wall Street Journal that his partnership with Adidas has been put under review. The problem is certainly not access to capital for Kanye. What is do you think? I think there's a communication through what Kanye expects, you know, and is everybody on the team from the top down in line with that and did they agree upon that? You know, businesses, it's moving often, right? And when the things were good and everything was going great, that's fine. But when supply chain issues come and or maybe they have over inventory or they order too much, well, they're going to have to adjust those numbers. And as much as Kanye is, you know, somebody who's leading it, you know, the theory of business who pays the most says the most, you know, and if Adidas and those people have massive amount of inventory, they have to let go or they have to start cutting prices to retailers or not, you know, they don't have the people walking through their doors anymore. You know, you've got to make adjustments. So I don't know what those agreements are and I'll leave it up to all of them, but it's not always as one side is what we see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,91,2022-10-06 20:26:15
2773," all into their doors anymore. You know, you got to make adjustments. So I don't know what those agreements are. And I'll leave it up to all of them, but it's not always as one side is. What we see, Kanye happens to have a loud voice, but we haven't really heard from the people who are dealing with the supply chain and all the other things that they have challenges with. Damien, sticking with retail, another consumer facing brand I want to ask you about is Peloton because once again, today they're in the news announcing another round of cuts, a fourth round of job cuts this year. From your perspective, I guess, what does a company like Peloton? What do they need to do in order to turn things around and get investors back on board? That's a really good question. I thought Peloton would have been sold a long time ago because they happen to have a captivated audience, 45 minutes to an hour on viewing the screen. And I would have thought that one of the Netflix of the world, the Amazon's of the world would have just grabbed them due to eyeballs. So that's still not off the table at the moment, but I really don't know what they could do right now. I think that's over my pay gradient because they are suffering and I did invest in Peloton not after the bump, but after it brought it back down, but it kept going back down. And I'm like, what the hell did I do? So I wish I had the answers to that, but I don't have the answer to that. It has been interesting watching, just sipping from a fire hose, the amount of news coming out of there. Damien, you often quote Elon Musk and talk about his leadership style and his innovation over the recent years. What do you make of the latest twist in turn? Suddenly he's back in on buying Twitter. I think he's a sharp negotiator, and Elon has always three or four steps ahead. He's already had, he has a plan for this thing and I think he's just basically doing what we all do. You go to the house, you put a bid on it, you get everybody out of the way and then you start setting the engineers in there and you find out all the things that you would like to have adjusted sooner or later, before the seller gets seller's fatigue or you get them to go down on pricing and you get them where you want them. So I think it's just a negotiation and the crazy thing is he's using the same exact platform that he's purchasing to help negotiate what he wants to do. He's brilliant, I will never try to think ahead of Elon Musk. Yeah, Damien, I guess just your reaction now has handled this acquisition so far and also heading into a company where the culture is obviously has gone through many rollercoaster rides to say the least over the last several months as someone who has a very successful track record. I guess how do you kind of write that ship? How do you write the ship of their culture? Yes. Challenging at the moment, you have to almost get to the theory of crashing and burning or slashing all leadership because it really comes from a leadership standpoint and getting all the old guards out of the way. And because today is very hard to get at workforce that really wants to work for you. They want to work for culture, they want to work for purpose. So I believe that it's really going to be cleaning house and you get there of all the people that are at the top. All right, Damien, John, wanted to say you did a great job on Mask Singer. You're looking spelt, Matt. And you look like you have really been working it out, brother. Good to see you. Black Entrepreneurs Day, October 27th at New York City's Apollo Theater, the website blackentrepreneursday.com. Please check it out the deadline, the 12th. Good to see you, sir. All right, come on up next. We're going to take a quick break here. When we come back, OPEC plus cuts on the rise in the Biden administration reported looking elsewhere from oil will tell you where next. Drink some water today up to the stage,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,92,2022-10-06 20:30:46
2774," Sorry. All right, with OPEC Bloss following through with historic production cuts of two million barrels a day, where will the United States go to offset those cuts? According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the answer just might be Venezuela. That will involve the loosening of sanctions with the Maduro regime. Scott Bauer is the CEO of Prosper Trading Academy. Let's talk about this with him good to see a Scott. So first, the White House pushing back a little bit on this this morning saying it's premature to suggest sanctions relief. What's your reaction to the cuts and the potential for dealing with the Maduro regime to offset them? Well, I think it's very dangerous and it's dangerous because they've been in talks or at least they started talks at the beginning of the Russia, Ukraine, war back in March. So we're talking it's been six or seven months. I don't even want to say negotiation, but since those talks have started and we haven't really gotten anywhere and it sure seems that this is an afterthought, almost, in a reaction to the cuts that we saw yesterday from OPEC Plus. So maybe this is going to happen, but it certainly puts the United States in my opinion in a position they don't want to be and something that they don't want to do in terms of giving up sanctions or quite frankly having to trust Maduro and the regime that they're going to come to the table and that they are going to meet the opposition and talk about legitimate elections in the future. So I think we're not in a great spot with this. So Scott, they're looking at doing this in order to boost supply. I guess how much of an effect do you see this potentially having on prices? Right, so that effect is not going to come quickly either. The state of drilling is in shambles in Venezuela. There has been a very long time where there hasn't been anything going on and even Chevron, who's the big driller going to have to get in there, it's going to take them months to get up and running. So in the near term, it has no effect whatsoever on adding any supply to the marketplace. We're talking probably three to six months down the road. Now, maybe if it happens, maybe the market looks at that and says, okay, that's good enough. We know that there's going to be some pain right now, but maybe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,93,2022-10-06 20:35:00
2775," the six months down the road. Now, maybe if it happens, maybe the market looks at that and says, OK, that's good enough. We know that there's going to be some pain right now, but, you know, maybe by the end of the year or first quarter next year, we know there's going to be this supply coming back on. But even when Venezuela was in their full production, that was 3 million barrels a day. So, you know, let's say we get a third of that back, maybe half of that back, you're looking at a million to a million and a half a day, what's that is up and running? Of course, all this matters depends upon your interpretation of those OPEC plus cuts, which they say are around 2 million barrels a day. Again, Amos Hoxtine told CNBC this morning, he thinks it's closer to 900,000, but he said he'd actually be surprised if there's any net cut at the end eventually anyway, and it shouldn't have a massive impact on prices. What do you make of that? I actually agree with that, and that's because they haven't hit their quota. So, that 2 million number that they're floating out there, because they haven't hit their quotas now, that's why we see that actual reduction, if you will, the 900,000 or a million. Quite frankly, I'm surprised that the market reacted the way it did, that it's not more of a buy the rumor sell the news type of event. I understand why crude went up after the announcement yesterday morning. I would have thought we would have actually seen it fall back a little as the market really digested, what you just mentioned, that 2 million number is really not 2 million. Scott, what do you think this all means for gas prices going up, looking down the line here? The average national average today is 387 up about 4 cents from yesterday up 9 cents from the last week. Are we going to be back above $4 soon? Yeah, I think we're going to see that probably within the next couple of weeks. And, you know, it's that chicken and egg thing when we see crude prices go down, yeah, gas prices go down a little bit or takes them a long time. Now, all of a sudden, you know, over the last week, 10 days, we've seen crude prices rising. And man, we've seen, at least where I live, probably 40 to 50 cents a gallon higher. It just the last week. So, yes, I think sooner rather than later, I would bet even by the end of next week, we're back above the average of $4 a gallon. Bad news here for consumers. All right, Scott Bauer, great to speak with you. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a good day. Thank you, Sean, for some big breaking news now on cannabis reform. President Biden announcing about an hour ago that the administration will pardon all federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. They'll also urge states governors to do the same and ask the HHS secretary and attorney general to reexamine how cannabis is scheduled. As you might expect, shares of marijuana stocks soaring on this news. We are talking a minimum increase around 20 percent for a lot of the big names and check it out here. Or a canopy cure leaf, green thumb and true leaf. And the biggest gainer on the day is with us now. True leaf up 36 percent on this news. We're joined now by the CEO of True Leaf, Kim Rivers. Kim, nice to see you. First, there had been a lot of negative sentiment regarding the abide administration and how they handled cannabis just your reaction to this U-turn. Well, I mean, better late than never. That's what I would say. And I'm really thankful that President Biden did step up and fulfill one of his campaign promises, which was, of course, as he stated early on that no one should be in jail for cannabis use or possession. So we've gotten the possession side of things at the federal level today, which, of course, is historic and is very, very important. And so I do want to pause and say, you know, thank you. And hopefully this is the first of many steps in the right direction as it relates to reform. I'm also very hopeful that, of course, the governors will follow suit at the state level as there are many, many more folks incarcerated at the state level for possession as well. And so hopefully that will, this will, this will start a movement there. President Biden tweeting, as I've said before, no one should be in jail for just using or possessing marijuana. Today I'm taking",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,94,2022-10-06 20:39:05
2776," This will start a movement there. President Biden tweeting, as I've said before, no one should be in jail for just using or possessing marijuana. Today, I'm taking steps to end our failed approach. Let's talk about the third aspect here, which is examining the scheduling of cannabis. How significant is that news? You know, that's again, that is historic and monumental. As President Biden correctly pointed out, currently marijuana is scheduled the same as heroin. I think we can all agree that that is simply laughable at this point. There are millions of Americans who utilize cannabis legally under state programs today for health and well-being, and of course, also recreationally under adult use programs as alternatives to alcohol as an example. And so, you know, certainly it sends a strong signal that this administration is taking proactive steps to re-examine how this country has categorized marijuana historically. And again, hopefully this is the beginning of a conversation that is long overdue as it relates to significant and substantive reform. Kim, clearly investors are optimistic of federal legalization. We mentioned your stock popping 36% on this news. Are you more optimistic of legalization than you were a few hours ago? You know, I think that this this market in the sector has been fairly held back as a result of the lack of federal action. I think that, you know, coming into a democratic controlled house in Congress coupled with a presidency who ran on promises of cannabis reform. The sector has been stagnated and waiting for, you know, a substantive step forward, which I think was provided today. So, you know, there has been a lot of work that's been done in both chambers and actually by bipartisan work that's been done in both chambers and conversations around substantive frameworks. And again, this is going to take some work. So I do want to say that because it is a complex issue and we do need to make sure that we get it right and that we are thoughtful and comprehensive and that we are and have a resulting ecosystem that is encompassing and is one that is sustainable. But certainly I am encouraged for sure that this is that first step that I believe that the market and certainly that we have been we have been looking for. I'm hearing cautious optimism. Give me a time frame. How long do you think we are before federal legalization? And the biggest obstacle here has been just getting safe banking through the Senate past the House now a half a dozen times. When can that get done? Well, so, you know, certainly safe banking is is teed up and ready to go. It has been for quite some time. It's been past numerous occasions on numerous occasions in the House. Of course, on the Senate, there's been a lot of conversation around, you know, safe banking as a standalone or safe banking paired with some sort of additional criminal justice reform. I'm actually expungement is it was a was a and certainly making sure that we have we have remedies for folks who are in prison to this today actually is a big step to help that. And perhaps will then, you know, is for an action on safe banking, which we certainly were hopeful would happen before the end of the year. I can tell you that in terms of full blown legalization and again, that is going to take some work. We do need to make sure that it is a thoughtful program that is, you know, does ensure that folks who are currently utilizing cannabis are able to continue and that we are we are thoughtful about how that product is regulated and that is safety, of course, is a paramount concern. And then also again, the ecosystem that's developed as one that is inclusive and diverse. And again, I just I think that we do need to make sure that we can all stand behind that result. But in terms of when that can happen, and there are a lot of measures in the legislature that have been drafted, and there are bills that are literally sitting and waiting waiting to go. There's framework bills, there's bills that address, you know, research and safety. And so there's there's a lot of work that that is ready and can come to fruition quickly. If the political will is there to actually dig in and lean into this issue and begin and begin to get some things passed out. So I think that again, press.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,95,2022-10-06 20:43:20
2777," If the political will is there to actually dig in and lean into this issue and begin to get some things passed out. So I think that, again, President Biden's support in his signaling that he is willing to spend some political capital on this and to – in a signal to Congress that this is an issue that's important, which it should be because it's important to the American voters. You know, the American acceptance rate, as it relates to cannabis, has only increased since President Biden has been in office. Pull after pull shows that Americans want legal reform and legal access to cannabis. So no surprise there. And again, hopeful that this is the first of many steps to come. Been searching for Republican reaction. Can't find much. Congresswoman Nancy Mays did tweet, applaud the administration for their necessary big step forward and bringing justice to so many. She is one of the few Republican supporters in the House of cannabis legislation still waiting for some Senate comments. Truly CEO Kim Rivers. Nice to see you as always. Thank you. Thank you. All right, coming up. The auto is using AI to help people level up their skills and advance their careers. The company CEO joined us next to tell us how they're doing. All right. Advanced in your career or moving to a new industry can be confusing and stressful. But what if artificial intelligence could assess your skill set and connect you with the training and certifications that you would need? That's precisely what our next guest company, Otto, aims to do, joining us now for more on that we want to bring in the founder and a CEO of Otto Milan of Cortistani for today's installment of Career Control brought to you by straight talk wireless. Milan is great to see you. Just talk to us, I guess, first just give us a groundwork of what exactly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,96,2022-10-06 20:48:00
2778," for today's installment, a career control brought to you by straight talk wireless monitoring. To see you, just talk to us, I guess, first, just give us a groundwork of what exactly auto is and how the AI exactly works. Thank you for having us, Johnna. I'm really excited to be here. So basically what we do with the AI is, we have to start by understanding who you are as an individual. So we assess you on your personality and it's all sorts of traits from how artistic you are realistic and enterprising. And then the next component is understanding what past experience you have. It could be being a waitress, it could be being a farmer, which is what I did before I went into, you know, working in tech, but truthfully, whatever it is, we understand what your experience is and we run all of that information against a massive database of resumes to see where is their overlap in, where you are today, with where you want to go and how can we help you understand what those skills are that are monetizable and in demand in today's marketplace and recommend the right curriculum from across the internet and our partners to be able to recommend the right courses to quickly up-skill you and make you valuable again in the marketplace and competitive. Well, who's your target audience or these people that are just entering the workforce have only been in the workforce for a few years or are also people going to use auto that have been in a job for maybe 10, 12 years and they're looking to change what they're doing today. So our focus today is on 18 to 24-year-olds, individuals that are currently trying to find more alternative solutions than the current university and college route. However, the truth is as we start to scale out and our AI becomes more intelligent at realizing what success looks like at different stages of people's careers, we'll be able to take anyone and even an individual that may have been out of the workforce for say 10 years after being some expert of a sort and helping them identify what are the one or two skills that we could help you find and train to then be really competitive in the job market. Milan, presumably there was a problem with the way this is happening now that you were looking to solve. What is the breakdown in the way people are choosing careers where we stand today? Sure. So right now there isn't much clarity into how an individual that is going on after high school to figure out where they want to go with their career and what it is that they want to do beyond a college advisor or the SAT kind of helping determine which school you could get into. And likewise, when you're on LinkedIn or indeed or any of these platforms really where you keep all of your information about your past experience, that information is never used to help you understand what you're missing when you don't land a job. And that's what we want to do. We're here to use data for good and gamification to basically help you understand why it is you don't land a job when you apply for it. By knowing what a competitor that did land that job, what it was that they had as a skill and what we can do to help make you more competitive the next time. So say someone out there right now wants to get started. Where do they start? How much does it cost? How involved is the process? So if you're interested right now in one of the three career tracks we offer, which are in digital marketing, software engineering and graphic design, you could come to auto.com and you sign up and you'll be able to, after joining our wait list as we're in beta right now, you'll be able to essentially take our AI assessment and we'll start by figuring out who you are and then recommending the courses for you to get started. We have a membership that starts at $12 and that helps you get significant discounts on all of the curriculum we offer. But even for users who are not members of ours, they can come to auto and they can take courses at the same price as any of our partners online or better guaranteed. All right, auto founder and CEO Milan Kordistani really appreciate a good stuff you're doing there. Thanks. Shout out over to you. What's moving after hours, my friend? All right, Dave, we have two stocks here in focus. Let's kick it off with Levi's and talk off just about 5% the company lowering its full year forecast citing the strong dollar supply chain disruptions two things that are clouding the company's outlook right now. They cut their full year adjusted EPS and net revenue growth guidance for the year third quarter numbers though, we're actually not that bad. EPS coming in better than expected 40 cents. The street was looking for an estimate of 37 cents revenue just a bit like 1.5 billion estimate there was for one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,97,2022-10-06 20:52:10
2779," That bad EPS coming in better than expected 40 cents. The street was looking for an estimate of 37 cents revenue just a bit like 1.5 billion estimate there was for 1.6 billion in terms of the three month movement in this stock. Not too bad up about 1% relatively speaking. That's actually pretty strong here to date though. The stock in the red off just around 36%. Let's take a look at AMD here. AMD under pressure after hour. There are some of its competitors, a company coming out cutting its third quarter revenue guidance. They cited the weak PC market and also quote significant inventory corrections throughout the PC supply chains. We're seeing AMD off just about three and a half percent right now they now see third quarter revenue at 5.6 billion. The initial estimate was for 6.7 billion. Certainly has been a tough couple of months for AMD because you can see the stock off 33% in just the past two months alone year to date of just over 52%. Right after we got this news from AMD after hour some of its biggest competitors and video Intel are also under pressure after hours following the news. So AMD cutting a third quarter revenue guidance was shares off just over 3%. Dave. All right. Thank you. Shout out to you. I'm watching for tomorrow and what the Fed is indeed watching tomorrow. All these September jobs report, the forecast is for 250,000 jobs created. The unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7%. That's all according to definitive. Now 315,000 jobs are added in August. Still a very strong number but well below the average of more than a half million over the last 12 months. The ADP data we got yesterday and I showed private companies created 208,000 jobs in September. While earlier this week we got the Joel to the number of open positions slipped by more than 1 million. The September report also expected to show hourly earnings growth has decelerated albeit slightly to 5.1% from 5.2. And lastly we will focus on that all important labor force participation rate most recently clocking in at 62.4 as you can see below the pre pandemic level. Taking a break here but when we come back consumers may soon learn a lot about what's inside the alcoholic beverage they're consuming. Find out when we come back.

2780," We want to get to some breaking news here. Following the reporting say is going to submit for personal currencies. And then saying they had so for 20 a share this month saying that, quote, Twitter will not take yes for an answer. So again, Twitter responding here after hours, you're seeing the stock up just around 710s of a percent. All right. Well, it is about that time of day where we start thinking about what we might be drinking tonight. And it's Thursday, maybe about what you're going to be drinking this weekend. Reportedly, the Treasury Department wants to know what's in what we are drinking, responding to a lawsuit by the Consumer Federation of America. The Department may push for beer wine and spirits companies to display calorie counts involving sizes and ingredients on their labels. Indeed, there are some beer industry, some players in the beer industry that do this on a voluntary basis. There's been some pushback from wine makers. Josh, our producer, looked up, Avaco soda. That's what I like to drink when I'm out having some fun. Has 133 calories for 225 grams serving. That's a lot more than what I was expecting to be. I don't think I'm a fan of this labeling for alcohol. What do you think? I'm a huge fan of this happening. I think this is long overdue. 95% of beers already do this voluntarily. I have a problem with the spirits industry in particular, although I texted it to Stiller in my area. He said, oh, this will increase the cost of doing business more regulations, slow down product development. Here's Koss Amigos, the leading Tequila brand on the market from George Clooney. And if you turn it around, we don't know what's in it. And I talk to a lot of liquor store owners who are concerned. They want to know not only the calorie count, they want to know the ingredients. Here's another one. This is the rocks brand, Taremana, very different on the backside. He breaks it all down from what's in it to the amount of alcohol per serving, serving size. I think this is long overdue. But David, it has not stopped you from drinking. Both of those bottles almost gone, very, very little bit left. All right, that'll do it for us. For Shana, I'm Dave.

2784," The super sweet stuff. Thanks so much, Bill. Good to see you. Constellation, Brancy. Thanks. Good to see you. I want to bring you some quick breaking news on CBS. There is a report from Bloomberg that CBS is now in exclusive talks to buy Kenoe health. That's the health care provider that has clinics that is backed by Barry Stern, like the billionaire here. And there have been a lot of reports about who was in the running to buy the company. And indeed, Humana has first right of refusal through an agreement that it made with Kenoe in 2019. So that's something to keep in mind as well. But you see the Kenoe health shares are up 10%. CBS had already been following after some news on some new Medicare star ratings and how that might affect the company's profitability. But nonetheless, that move upward and I believe Kenoe is actually halted right now because of volatility after that big spike up in those shares. Coming up, Jared Bluckery is going to give us a deep dive into the out of finance interactive on this jobs report Friday as the NASDAQ leads losses down by 2%. Almost 20 minutes into this Friday's trading session here on this jobs Friday, I might add. Taking a look at the major averages, you're seeing us down across the board for the Dow, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ here in the US major averages there with the deepest declines on a percentage basis on the NASDAQ, the tech heavy average, but the largest point decline on the Dow down by about 1.4%. For much more on today's take, let's get in with Yahoo Finance as Jared Bluckery. Yes, well, maybe a little bit too hot to handle on those jobs numbers. We're seeing red across the board here for the day. Let's check out for the week. Now we had some big gains on Monday and Tuesday, which we are now giving back, but maybe only about half of those 2% isn't bad for the first week of October. I think investors will take that. Here is the Dow up about 2 and 3% and then S&P 500 somewhat in the middle there. Let's take a look at the sector action for today. Energy has been in the forefront. Crude oil had a bid all week, but tech consumer discretionary, those two mega-capillated sectors, those are in the red for over 2% communication services, also housing a lot of those big names. That's down almost 2% followed by financials, materials, etc. Too hot to handle, I don't know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,1,2022-10-07 13:52:32
2785," Over 2% communication services also housing a lot of those big names. That's down almost 2% followed by financials, materials, etc. Too hot to handle, I don't know, but a lot of Fed mispricing. Let's remember the Fed doesn't want to see stocks going up too much right now. So this is actually in line with their plan. Nasdaq 100, Microsoft down 3% Tesla also Amazon also in that boat down 3% and Vidya down almost 5% Chinese stocks looks like they're taking it on the chin right now. Quick look at that board. I do want to show you something though. This is interesting. We got that news on the cannabis sector yesterday with Biden potentially pardoning a lot of people throughout the US who have been arrested for possession at least on the federal level. And we did see a big surge earlier yesterday. And we can see for the week we're seeing some nice gains right here. Other than that, let's check out our sentiment and leaders board right here. And we can see cannabis for the week. That's MJ. That's in the lead here followed by meme stocks gambling, Korean stocks, home builders. So still sitting on some gains. But let's not forget this is today's price action. This is what matters. This is jobs reports. We got to figure out where we got to think about what could happen in the days and weeks to come guys. Yeah, we'll find it soon. Jared Blicker. All right. Thanks so much, Jared. Let's get on our stab the day here and stick with a little bit of a market gloom angle. 3150. That's how low the S&P 500 could go if the Federal Reserve doesn't engineer a soft economic landing at the same time it aggressively lifts interest for a says the folks at Goldman Sachs if that level is hit, it would represent about a 17% plunge for the S&P 500 from current levels. All right. So to calm the midterm elections are going to be here before you know it will break down what history shows about investing and the midterms next. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,2,2022-10-07 13:57:20
2786," If you're going to have a job, the midterm elections will be here before you know it on November 8th. The Democrats are expected to win the Senate. The Republicans are seeing winning the House, but of course they think it could happen ultimately. And before the midterms, there will be a federal reserve meeting on interest rates on November 2nd. That decision and the stock market reaction could then affect election turnout and influence how stocks and the year. Saasie has more numbers behind all of this on the stake. Like forget about jobs, we're all focused on jobs today. You're always a step ahead Brian Saasie. Yep. Yeah well when everybody zigs I usually try to zag. So I might be the only one in financial media talking about the midterm election state, which is good because that's what we're here for. Y'all, Vance, prepare investors for what might come three, six months down line or in this case November 8th. So we're looking at the midterm elections and of course before that you have that fed meeting on November 2nd. But here's what we have up for grabs here just to set the scene for those midterm elections. Lots of for grabs and hence you will probably see the market really focus on all things midterms. We have an interesting chart too just to get a get a vibe of the economy into election day and is it it's the misery index that comes compliments for the team at Jeffries. It is essentially the unemployment rate plus the inflation rate and you've seen that spike as a result as consumers battle obviously high levels of inflation. Now in terms of stats, you know I want to just zoom in on a couple interesting ones here from US Bank that caught my attention. The S&P 500 has historically outperforming the market in the 12 month period after a midterm election with an average return. Get this guy is about 16.3 percent that is pretty good. I will also note the last time the S&P 500 produced negative returns during the 12 months after a midterm election was 1939 while was going on there as a reminder because we were not on this planet that was the great depression in World War II. So I think the market is going to become against a lot of headwinds and concerns regarding this. You know we talked to Laurie Calvin-Cyniastariate, RBC saying you know that when she talks to her clients they wouldn't mind Republicans getting a little more control of things here. Maybe some divided government, maybe some of those more aggressive areas of the Democratic agenda don't get through, maybe markets like that. But again that's a lot of ifs and that's a lot of whens and my take here going back to a lot in old school James Carvell quote it's the economy stupid and I think it will be very interesting to see how voters come out here on the eighth. Do they vote with the economy or do they find something else or another issue they're very focused on. All right a lot to continue to watch their saws. Guys appreciate that take this morning saws coming up next though everyone we're going to reset the show breakdown how the market is reacting to this in September jobs report you see it there on the screen but that's just a brief glimpse there's more within those numbers on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,3,2022-10-07 14:01:17
2787,"沒事 Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live, everyone. We've reached this, the top of the 10 AM hour Brad Smith here in studio with Julie Hyman, Brian Sasi on assignment, as we'll say, from home today. Happy Friday to you all here on this jobs Friday. Let's take a look at where the market's saying following that jobs report earlier, which was just a little bit hotter than expectations. We're taking a look at the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, all lower on the day. The Dow is lower by a little more than 480 points to the downside of about 1.6%. The S&P 500, they're also seeing that deep in the red right now by roughly 2% that looks like, and then additionally, the Nasdaq composite, you're seeing that down by about 312 points. And taking a deeper dive into that jobs report, of course, later on in this show, we're going to have set criteria of labor, Marty Walsh, going to join us momentarily to get reaction from the White House. So stay tuned for that conversation. Plus, it's Jeans Friday, wherever you find yourself in the world. But Levi's under pressure this morning. After the denim maker cut its outlook, we're going to speak to the company's CFO to discuss its latest earnings report as you get ready to put the jorts away. And an unprecedented move in the movie world, Netflix, is set to show the knives, out sequel, and major theaters one month before its streaming release. We're going to discuss what that means for the streaming space. All of that, much more coming up during this 10 AM hour. But for much more on today's markets, let's get on over to Yahoo! Finances and Nez Faray is about 30 minutes into today's trading session and Nez on Over To You. And Brad, you mentioned the losses after that jobs report. And we are still seeing the S&P 500 down 2%. But if we just pull up a five day chart because of Monday and Tuesday's rally, we are set to end the week in the green for the major averages because of those days if we stay at this space. Let's see what happens throughout the day. Looking also at the 10-year treasury note, that's higher up 7 basis points at 3.9%. We saw that 10-year treasury yield go higher after that jobs report. Also the US dollar index, that moved higher after the jobs report as well. Want to point out what's happening with Bitcoin because we did see Bitcoin moving to the downside earlier. And then looking at the sector action, we're watching the high growth names that are really under pressure. So you're watching tech, consumer discretionary, materials are leading to the downside. Over on the NASDAQ 100, the mega caps, as I mentioned, Tesla down 3% Amazon also lower, Nvidia down 5% and the semiconductors are really seeing some pressure today after that revenue warning from AMD. Finally, I want to mention what's happening with the home builders because of higher interest rates and what this how this affects the home builders. Well, you're looking at them in the red right now, especially home builders and also companies that have to do with mortgages, guys. Yeah, definitely anything, interest rate sensitive is in focus here today. Thanks so much, Inez. Well, let's continue our conversation on the job.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,4,2022-10-07 14:06:09
2788," with mortgages guys. Yeah, definitely anything interest rate sensitive is in focus here today. Thanks so much, Ynez. Well, let's continue our conversation on the job report and the market implications. Joining us now, John Tobin, Epic Investment Partners, Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst. John, it's good to see you. So as we look at this, good news is bad news, kind of jobs day. I mean, that's just very simply how we should look at it here, that the Fed is going to be raising rates for the foreseeable future. I think that's right. I think the market it sees in certainly the past few days, we've seen evidence of it. It's looking for some reason, something to latch on to to justify the rally. They're hoping for some evidence that the Fed's about to pivot. The Reserve Bank of Australia's move early in the week ignited that hope. And even though the Fed speakers all week long, pushed back on that pretty hard, I think the evidence today is from the jobs report, the jobs market still remains strong, and the Fed still has work to do. Now, as we've talked about it in our shop this morning on our morning call, there is clearly evidence of deceleration here. So if you're trying to find some good news here, that the numbers are moving in the right direction. This is a 263K increase in jobs, but it shows continual deceleration over time. Average hourly earnings are up, but again, evidence of deceleration. So I think the main takeaway is, things are moving in the right direction, but the Fed still has a lot of work to do. Rates are still going higher. So John, should the other takeaway here, just looking at the market action in the early going is for investors to fade any rallies? Well, I think that's, I mean, that would be my personal view that with each attempt to rally into this, I've continued to make the case that I don't see what the foundation is, for a strong rally, for a sustainable rally. I mean, if you think about what the drivers of equity market returns are, its earnings growth, its dividends, and its multiple expansion, and if rates are going higher, that's a headwind from multiple expansion. And if the economy is slowing down and maybe headed for a recession, that's a headwind for earnings growth. So the main underpinnings that would support a sustainable rally just aren't there. I think to me, this is a market environment where investors need to keep some defensive exposure in their asset allocation. We've had a conversation, especially around the shift in the types of jobs, the employment situation really lays out, kind of sector by sector here. But for some of those businesses that are looking at the amount of people that post pandemic, they've realized they actually need to run the business, it also becomes a question of where some of those employees will find employment elsewhere and in different sectors as well as many people have upskilled over the course of the pandemic. I mean, does that drastically shape everything from wages all the way to what a solid baseline sector by sector actually looks like? Well, you're absolutely right. There are some sector trends that we're noticing here, where there's strength, where there's weakness, there's strength in leisure and hospitality, there's weakness in other sectors, there's weakness in energy, there's weakness in things related to building and construction, of course. But and it's disruptive for the economy, as you point out, that people are looking for jobs and looking to move perhaps into new areas where there is job growth. So there is that friction, but that's not really something new, that's a or necessarily a post pandemic phenomenon. I think that's historically bending case. There's always a friction as people move and try to direct themselves into the areas where there's greater employment opportunities. John, bottom line when it comes to these markets, I think people are trying to figure out what the heck to do right now. And you have some interesting stuff in your portfolio, including consumer staples, things like Home Depot and Walmart. Do you think that a company like Walmart, for example, has gotten past its inventory troubles and is still going to be able to benefit as we head towards the holiday season? So it's absolutely true that the retailers have inventory issues to grapple with. And I wouldn't want to say that for Walmart, that it's all said and done and they're behind it. I think our view on Walmart is more of a basic fundamental view that this is a business that historically is resilient in economic downturn.��릥",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,5,2022-10-07 14:10:07
2789," I think our view on Walmart is more of a basic fundamental view that this is a business that historically is resilient in economic downturns. And if we're looking at a slow economic environment and we're looking at the possibility of recession and we think about where are we most likely to have the stocks and the companies that are most likely to hold up best in that environment, it is some of the defensive sectors, the traditional defensive sectors like Staples, the Walmart's healthcare, for example. We have utilities, another area where we have exposure even, but at the same time, even some financials will hold up better regional banks. There'll probably be some evidence of weakening low demand and some pick up in credit quality issues, but we think that they're at a very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure to and we think these are sectors that won't mean that they won't feel any pressure from a slowing economy, but rather that they will be more resilient in the face of a challenging market environment. Just trying to tie both inflation and employment together because one of that is an input cost into the prices that consumers are having to pay as well. For consumers and of course everybody who's in this economy and is working, there's still money that is going out the door out of your pockets both on a necessity basis or on a discretionary basis. So with that in mind, where then are we going to expect to see kind of wages stabilized at the same time that the Fed is trying to see inflation stabilized? Well, Fed is clearly trying to get inflation down and trying to get a way to growth down. And what that really means even though they don't like to say it so much out loud is they need the unemployment rate to go up and they need jobs growth to slow pretty dramatically. So but you're right, this implies pressure on the consumers. So there'll be pressure on the consumer in terms of weaker jobs growth. There'll be more people unemployed. There's more pressure on consumer pocketbooks because of inflationary pressures, what people are paying at the pump for gasoline, what they're paying for their energy bill when they get their content bill every month. So there's pressure on the consumer. This is all part of the narrative of an economy that is being forced to slow down by Fed policy. John, if I'm correct, you have some exposures to some big cap tech names. Apple, Microsoft and IBM, even a broadcom, but in light of this AMD warning, which is pretty shocking. I mean, I missed their expectations by a billion dollars on sales or even trying to rotate out of big cap tech or you're going to just try to just survive this volatility. Well, you know, the truth is in the strategy that I help run, tech is a significant underweight for us. We actually have a hard time finding tech names that fit the characteristics that we see. We're looking for companies that have growing cash, they'll pay attractive growing dividends and otherwise use cash to distribute to shareholders through share buybacks. So we do have exposure to some of those tech names that you mentioned, but we are underweight. We're underweight those names by definition underweight Apple apples over 4% of the index. So while we have Apple in the portfolio, it's an underweight apple and while we have tech in the portfolio, it's an underweight to the tech sector. I'm sure that we some names that we look at and will probably trim them and maybe even exit them. There's nothing that we're thinking about doing right this minute. All right. We'll leave it there. John Tobin, Epoch Investment Partners, Managing Director and Profoli Manager. Good to see you. Have a good weekend. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it. Yep. All right. Before we head to break, let's pull up shares of Target, which are getting a bullish call by Goldman Sachs retail analyst, Kate McShane. Shane is reiterating and bywriting on Target and issuing a $205 price target. The upbeat call comes as Target is warned on sales three times since March 1st, only to the economic slowdown. It says McShane. We think despite the missteps, Target has taken this year on both merchandising and guidance. It remains a retail, secular winner, which should support the stock. We'll take more into Target on October 17th when Target Chairman CEO Brian Cornell chats with me at the Yow Finance All Market Summit. Definitely looking forward to that chat in that day. All right. Coming up, U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh will join us to talk all things. Just as Joe's report, don't go anywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,6,2022-10-07 14:14:14

2791," Seeing more and more companies want to create more and build more here in the United States, we're seeing the president really focusing on that as well, doing more in the United States. We're seeing in this particular drop month, we didn't see, we saw actually a decrease in government hiring around education. So that's one number that was low. But companies are still looking for people. You're still hearing it every day. I mean, as you mentioned earlier, I think we might have been Julie saying, some people do eye-cutting back on their employees because they're anticipating what the future might bring, but a lot of companies are still hiring. And so with a cut back on employees yet hiring also kind of decreasing or decelerating, if you will, what does that spell out for the people who, during the great resignation, had kind of put in that two-week notice and said, I've got another offer somewhere else. I've got a greater offer on the table. Is this still a job hopper's market or from your perspective, is it something where that is decelerating so much to the point where it's very much shifting and employees should be considering exactly where they make those moves? I still think it's a good market for employees to look at for better opportunities, but I think what's happening is employers are realizing now they have to do a little more to keep their employees. Employers don't want to hire somebody and then have to six months lose them to another place for higher salary or better benefits. So I think employers are starting to, when I go around talking to companies, they're really looking to hybrid work, how does that work? They're looking at opportunities, childcare, and other things to encourage people to come into their companies. And I think companies are adapting to the change in the environment around workers today. And some of the folks we're talking to are saying some of these changes are going to be long-standing, right? That we're seeing a more profound shift in the workforce because of increased flexibility of being able to work from home, because of sort of life decisions people made during the pandemic, maybe some people taking early retirement, et cetera. How is the administration thinking about some of those longer-term changes and addressing some of those longer-term trends? Well, I think one of the biggest things that President did in the bill back by the legislation that didn't go to the Senate, child care, paid family leave, sick time, medical leave, all of those issues are very important to families today. And I think a lot of companies, some of them, are getting there on their own. But child care is a very complicated issue. And I think that we as a country have to think about and rethink about the way that our child care system works because it's expensive. And we're having a high time retaining workers in that industry because we don't pay them enough to take care of our kids. So I think as we think about long-term, that's going to be one investment on a federal level, but also on the private sector. So I think, you know, pre-pandemic, we didn't hear about the changes in companies. These companies would change the way they did office space, open areas, things like that. But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future. And what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. That's not my role. My role is to try and assist them and help with them and share best practices where I can and what other companies are doing. Mr. Secretary, last time we spoke to you about a month ago on jobs day, we're still looking to and analyzing the quiet quitting movement. Now a month later, I have a big problem is this in the country. I don't, I mean, I haven't really heard about it from companies. I know that it's being reported in the press. I've talked to a lot of companies in the country and I haven't heard about that. Certainly that's a concern if it continues on because when people hire people, they expect them to do a day's work for a day's pay. And I think that that's something that we have to continue and encourage. But when I talk, as I've gone around the country this last month and I've done a lot of trips, no company has approached me on this quiet quitting idea. And Secretary, I want to ask you about the real strike in which you intervened last month and helped avert that strike. That was sort of an 11-hour agreement. I know it was sort of a marathon process, right, of working through it with them. What are some of the lessons learned from that? For example, would you get involved earlier in the future to sort of not have a down-to-the-wire situation? If I'm asked to get involved earlier, I would certainly in the potent negotiation. I'm not involved at the table, but I certainly am talking to both sides to make sure that encouraging both sides, and they already asked them to encourage them to stay at the table and get this contract done. In the real strike, this was a two-year period that they weren't able to get an agreement where the president had to appoint an emergency board to come up with a P.E.B.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,8,2022-10-07 14:23:15
2792," Strike, you know, this was a two-year period that they weren't able to get an agreement where the president had to appoint an emergency board to come up with a P.E.B. They came up with the recommendations and we built off of that. But certainly, you know, I think when you get to that point, there's a breakdown. So I've offered to anybody, anybody who wants if they want me to get involved or get us involved. But I think mediation is important as well. If you have two sides that kids can't get to an agreement, my recommendation is try and bring a mediator in. This is not to be me, but bring a mediator in. It's just to keep the conversation moving forward. And Labor Secretary, just while we have you, we do know that President Biden issued a presidential proclamation pardoning federal convictions for simple marijuana possession's offenses. These are people that have been barred in some cases from getting back into the workforce because of these convictions and offenses. Where will the Labor Department continue to do work at the state level, even, to ensure that there are opportunities for people to get occupations within the workforce? Yeah, we have to make sure what the President did yesterday is carried out. And too many of the people that are being pardoned by the President yesterday are people of color, and particularly the African-American community. And this has been the challenge in our country for a long time, where people were convicted of a minor marijuana offense that had a record. And I commend the President for his actions yesterday. And the folks that are out there, we're going to work with them to make sure that they can get into good employment, that this is not an impediment to their ability to get into the middle class and get a good paying job. U.S. Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, pleasure to have you on the show. And thanks as always for taking the time. Thank you. You guys coming up.

2793," Here are some other headlines that we're watching right now. Bite Dance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok. So it's operating losses more than triple last year to $7 billion, according to a Wall Street Journal report. But Bite Dance produced an operating profit in the first quarter of 2022, signaling the company could be turning a quarter after years of losing money. The privately held company, Basin Beijing, has long closely guarded its finances. It doesn't share financial results publicly. This report, which the Wall Street Journal says, was shared internally with employees, covers the full years for 2020 and 2021, as well as that first quarter of this year. cryptocurrency exchange finance, temporarily paused its service yesterday due to a cyber attack, with hackers making off with an estimated $100 million worth of cryptocurrency. Nancy Yo, CZ Zhao tweeted this morning confirming the exploit on its cross-chain bridge and said that customer funds are safe. Cross-chain bridge hacks have become a top security risk recently. This incident is the latest in a recent rise in blockchain hacks. And Impossible Foods has laid off 6% of its workforce as part of the company's restructuring to focus on future growth, according to reports. CEO Peter McGinnis reportedly said in a memo that the reorganization has been the works for the past few months and has, quote, created clear supply and demand functions with an emphasis on research and development. Several employees will receive 12 weeks of salary, the folks who are leaving, plus an additional week for each year of tenure at the company and a one-year extension for exercising stock options. Socks? September was a rough month all around for stocks, and one company in particular saw a significant drop after withdrawing its 2023 forecast, something evolved, operating, and environment. We're talking about FedEx here, folks, and that's what Yelphine's Jarblickery joins us with today for another edition of Then and Now, Jarb. That's right. Let's turn the clock back to the 1970s where FedEx, where Federal Express got its start founded in 1971 in Little Rock, Arkansas. The company officially began operations out of Memphis in 1973, and fun fact, the name Federal Express, it actually came about because a founder hoped it would attract the business of the Federal Reserve. It always comes back to the Fed, doesn't it, guys? That original Memphis team consisted of fewer than 400 people, yet in its first night of operations, FedEx delivered 186 packages to 25 different countries. Or cities, excuse me, by 1975 FedEx started installing drop boxes, and we began accustomed to seeing those in businesses. The overnight letter was introduced in 1981, and by 1983 FedEx made American history by becoming the first company to make $1 billion in revenue within 10 years of startup, without mergers or acquisitions. In 1978, FedEx went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker that we know FDX, and at IPO, at $24 per share, split adjusted, you got to divide by 32, it is 75 cents. Now, back to the present, we had that drastic mid-September drop of more than 20 percent, and now FedEx is trading around $155 per share, down more than 50 percent from its May 2021 record high, near $320 per share. So let's take a deep dive into where the company is right now. And on our Dow Jones heat map, actually this is a transports, Dow Jones transports, year to date, we can see FedEx down about 40 percent if we sort by performance. We can see kind of towards the downside, in fact only jet blue, not really appear, is down more than that, but you compare it to UPS, which is down 24 percent, and we do possibly have some execution issues. Now, Brian, I know that you've been really following FedEx, and especially it's, especially its guidance as of that last huge drop right here, and what it foretends for the earning season that we are about to jump into right now. Yeah, Jerry, you really got the sense, Alfred at FedEx, worrying that the economy is slowing down pretty sharply, but to your point, execution has been a big problem with this company, maybe to an extent that hasn't been seen over the prior 25 years. I got to tell you, you cover this space in these companies better than I do, and more closely, but I just know that FedEx kind of releases outside the normal earnings window, and perennially, quarter after quarter, they cite these dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,10,2022-10-07 14:31:37
2794," companies better than I do and more closely but I just know that FedEx kind of releases outside the normal earnings window and perennially quarter after quarter they cite these dollar effects problems and that's just not just this year this is going years back so I think there is a temptation to perhaps say that this is an idiosyncratic event this is particular to that company but you can't ignore the weight of the evidence with what we'll excuse me with what we've seen of the earnings and the projections for them that we've seen so far AMD the latest shot off the bow great work here uh... jarrely enjoy these and a lot of work goes into them thanks so much are Levi's the top training ticker on the alfine's platform this morning after cunning its outlook will go inside that outlook with Levi's cfo harmingt sing next g Leave I strut us out with the beat on earnings in its latest quarter. We're a stronger year's dollar, weakness in Europe and ongoing supply and change disruptions, let the jeans giant to cut its outlook. With more on this we have Harmeet Singh, Levi Strauss, CFO for more on this quarter. Harmeet, great to get some time with you. I want to go across the pond on Europe. I would say some surprising results at a Levi's Europe. That business, how it performs, sales and repression, that's a prize you? You know, as the high brand, good morning, as the quarter progressed it did surprise us. And as you know, we have a very strong brand. As you think about the quarter overall, our quarter was fairly solid, despite all the incremental headwinds who were up 7% in constant currency with BDPS. And the Levi's brand, just to the strongest quarter three revenues in a decade. And so as you think about our European business, the weather was fairly warm and the consumer there is under pressure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,11,2022-10-07 14:36:00
2795," And so as you think about our European business, the weather was fairly warm, and the consumer there is under pressure. And so what we did collectively as a team is we quickly geared up into action, and looked at discretionary costs. We focused on our direct to consumer business, because we have a diversified business model. They are parts of the world that are really strong, like Asia and Latin America, and they resisted strong growth. We also had some supply chain disruptions, especially in the US, which impacted the business. And so as we thought about the year, we said, okay, let's think about three things that impact the results. One is stronger dollar. The second is supply chain disruptions, and the third is softening consumer demand in the western part of the world. But if you think of Europe, Brian, there are parts of Europe that were fairly strong. UK and Spain were actually countries that grew. I think where we were softwares in Germany and France, the brand still fairly strong globally, as well as in Europe. When you talk about softening demand, Harmeet, is there a relative point that you think back to where this period is analogous to? You know, I would say, we've been as a company, we've been through good times and tough times. And I would say, as you think about softening demand, I was not here in 0809, but the financial crisis at that time did have an impact. As a company, our toughest period was during the pandemic, where all our stores were shut for about 90 days, and we lost a billion dollars just like that. But as a management team, and I'm really proud of the management team that's been around for a while, we actually geared up into action and said, okay, how do we manage through the crisis? But more importantly, how do we emerge stronger? And then in 2021, we registered our strongest financial year in a decade. So as we think about the next few quarters, and if things do tighten, that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about, how do we manage through the immediate crisis, which isn't a near term. But as a company and a brand, we will get out of it and we get out of it stronger. Some of you that I invested in June, we laid out longer term targets. These are what we call not start targets. We still get to and focused and delivering them over the longer term and emerging out of this as a stronger company. I mean, I appreciate the focus on the longer term. I want more shorter term question, which is after the inventory build, which I believe was above 40% for the last quarter, are you putting things on sale? How are you guys planning to clear out that inventory? Yeah, so the inventory build has something that we have flagged externally as well as internally. So it's intentional in a way. It's basically comprised of three things. The third of the inventory growth is driven by the fact the last year was a very low base tight inventory. And the fact that inflation has increased the cost of inventory, a third is inventory that is driven by the fact that we're bringing, because of the longer lead times in supply chain, we're bringing stuff early and we're getting ready for our ERP installation in quarter two of next year. And a third is largely goods in transit. Two thirds of our inventory is core. So think the 501s, think the 511s. And we can carry that through multiple seasons. And so there's no reason to discount that. We don't have a lot of obsolete. Where we do have obsolete, we are discounting that so that we can clear it. But overall, if you think of our gross margins, our gross margins and Q3 were still, you know, 400 basis points higher than 2019. It dipped a little relative to last year, but that was, you know, largely driven by foreign exchange and a little bit more discounting. We do expect the holiday season to be a little bit more promotional. And we're going to balance growing revenue and discounting because the brands never been this strong. And that's, you know, evidence by the fact that Q3 revenues for a levi is the strongest in a decade for quarter three. When you acknowledge discounting, it's hard not to think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,12,2022-10-07 14:40:21
2796," who's for Levi's with the strongest in a decade for quarter three. When you acknowledge discounting, it's hard not to think about the strongest brands right now needing to move through inventory and plowing some of the promotional elements. And so when you think about the percentage of full price that's selling versus the percentage of what would actually be discounted during this period of time through the holiday season, and even perhaps thereafter as well, what does that breakdown really look like to you? Yeah, you know, still a lot of what we sell is on a full price basis. We had estimated that gross margins in the second half of the year, because we'd be selling more below full price, you know, would be impacted about 100 basis points. In quarter three, there was a little bit more, about 130, 140 basis points. We have built that into our guidance in Q4, but overall, we still think we'll end the year at about, you know, 400 basis points higher than 2019. And that just evidences the strength of the brand are AURs, for example, which is the average unit retail price in quarter three was still up in the mid to high single digit. That means pricing that we have taken to offset cost is ticking. And our revenues were up slightly, sorry, our unit growth was up slightly. So overall, the brand's really strong docker as we have diversified also grew a lot double digit. And beyond yoga is just starting. We just open our first store in Santa Monica in LA, and if that, you know, does well, then, you know, we can add a lot many stores in the active way segment. So overall, our business is fairly diversified, Brad. And our thinking is that we will, you know, you know, move through this promotional environment by ensuring that brand continues, brand equity continues to build. Hey, Harvey, it's Brian here again. You know, I'm a loyal Levi's consumer, but I don't know. I don't know if I'm buying these new baggy dad jeans that you're bringing to market. I don't know if you realize how strong I work for this physique and those pants are not going to show it off. I got to be honest with you. And, you know, the fact is that we are a democratic brand. We have something for everybody. So if the baggy dad, you know, jeez is not what you like to wear, it doesn't fit your style. You can wear the tapered look, you can wear the slimmer look. There is something for you, Brad and for everybody else, across all age demographics. You know, I'd Levi's and that's what, you know, we are proud to ensure that every consumer gets what he or she needs. Yeah, Brian, the size has got to rock the jorts to show off the gas. Also, the shoes got a sharp, the leg. I'm still the skinny, skinny jeans guy. I mean, you got to show off the glutes. You put that time in. I want to show him off for a nice, nice, nice pair of jeans. I don't know. I don't know. There's a little out of fashion here, so we'll take this offline. We'll take this offline. It's not only jeans that you can get from Levi's. You can get more of a head to toe look. I'm wearing a wonderful Levi's shirt, gives a casual look. Because we continue to bleed those becoming more casual. And the worst becoming more casual brands like ours that offer more of a head to toe look. You know, other ones that will eat the charge. Yes, no matter which of the numbers of the models that you wear on the bottom, I have to say we were expecting either the leather jacket or the jean jacket, Harmeet. So it's good to know you're still wrapping on top with the white shirt. Harmeet's saying great for catching up with the Levi's Strauss CFL. Thanks, Julie. Thanks. Coming up, clock the talk, insight into the needs and wants of workers punching in and out of small businesses every day and the interview with HR Software Specialist Homebase. Thanks.

2797," Drink and love. Stocks continue to push lower right now after we got that hotter than estimated, better than estimated jobs report, but that implies that the Fed is going to have no reason to stop raising rates in the short term if inflation, especially if inflation, keeps up as it has been. And indeed, we saw year over year average hourly earnings rising by 5% as part of the jobs report right now the NASDAQ leaving the declines down by more than 2.5% that is really characteristic of what we've seen as of late with big cap tech suffering on days like this. And as I just mentioned, indeed the jobs report showed continued strong employment. Let's take a front line look at those numbers and especially what it means for small businesses joining us now is John Waldman, home base founder and CEO, home base, which is a software platform for small businesses essentially manages time clocks, HR, etc. John, thanks for being here appreciate it. It's really interesting you guys did some recent survey work and you found 64% of the small businesses you talked to said their financial performance would be better a year from now than it is right now. That seems to fly in the face of everything a lot of what we're hearing right? Yeah, good morning, Julie. It's good to see you. So we did find that we serve over 100,000 small businesses we serve over 2 million workers. And when we surveyed those small businesses, they were in fact more optimistic now than they were over the summer by 6% edge points in terms of thinking about their expansion over the next year or two. Now that seems kind of weird in the face of everything that we're reading in the headlines. But when it comes to small businesses, you have to remember this is in the context of such a hard two and a half years, first with COVID and forced closures and then into this just truly dramatic labor shortage that they've been living through over the last year and a half. So it is actually great to see those signs of optimism from small businesses. What is the experience that you have with those small businesses in terms of how they are navigating this environment?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,14,2022-10-07 14:49:07
2798," Great to see those signs of optimism from small businesses. What is the experience that you have with those small businesses in terms of how they are navigating this environment right now, especially as many of them are trying to best protect the business profitability while at the same time also trying to make sure that they are competitive with wooing the next generation of talent or just workers employees for their businesses? Yeah, I first as much as we've been talking about the labor shortage over the last year, I don't think we can talk about it. This is truly been an incredibly difficult thing for small businesses to deal with. And we see that on both sides. You have small businesses that are really healthy that can't expand in the way that they used to. You know, when we look at our data from across over 100,000 businesses, small businesses are not expanding at the rate that they were in 2019. On the flip side, it's actually gotten so bad that we've seen small businesses closed out because they can't hire. It was talking to one of our customers up in Seattle. Runs a restaurant, owns a restaurant that had been operating for 10 plus years and she shut it down, not because the demand wasn't there, not because of inflation. But because she could not hire people to work this business and she was tired. She and the other owners were tired of filling all the extra shifts. So this is real. This is a real challenge to small businesses. And if we're going to solve this, it's going to take a lot of different things, including making these jobs more attractive. John, have you had to slow hiring at home base? Yeah, that's a great question. But we like a lot of tech companies had to revisit some of our plans, hiring plans coming into this year. We haven't done a layoff or anything like that. But we certainly looked at next year and thought about our own, what can we do? How do we do more with less? You know, we see and our customers do in that for the last two years and we were asking ourselves the same question. So yeah, we slowed down our hiring plans. And John, what you just mentioned that Seattle anecdote is interesting to me because Seattle is one of the places that passed a minimum, a higher minimum wage, right? So you would think that among other things, higher wages would be getting those workers back in. Is it just not working like it used to in? If it's not, what are you hearing from your customers about why it's not? Yeah, well, we're hearing it from our customers and we're also hearing it from workers. I mean, we're serving two million plus workers and we're serving them regularly. Listen, you know, wages are always at the top of the list of things that hourly workers care about, but it's not the only thing that workers care about. And we're all staring at the same data on labor force participation and seeing that continue to take down. And I think we all have to take a hard look at this on how are we making these jobs more attractive? Wait rate is part of that and we have seen that go up with inflation. We have seen that go up in the job posts that are going out and the new hires that people are making through home base. We have a hiring tool that allows people to post jobs so we can see all of that data. But what we also see in talking to workers is it's not the only thing they care about. They care about flexibility. They care about their opportunity for learning and development. They care about the connection to the business and this is something that actually small businesses have a great advantage over larger businesses. And finally, John, full disclosure here, we were at a work dinner recently and I heard you talk about that this is not a short term problem that this sort of, especially entry level workforce is going to be a problem for. Decades, right? And I guess part of it has to do with population growth, but talk us through that. Yeah, we have been through a pretty traumatic, dramatic two and a half years in the labor market here. You know, we have seen millions of people die. We have seen immigration slow down. We have seen a lot of people leave the labor force. That is a pretty profound impact. But the net result of this of a labor shortage is not going away if you are reliant on entry level work. In 2027, we reach peak high school graduate in this country after that demographics are not on our side here for entry level work. But what that means is that the challenges that small businesses and every business are going through now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,15,2022-10-07 14:53:17
2799," After that, demographics are not on our side here for entry level work. What that means is that the challenges that small businesses and every business are going through now, we're going to be dealing with that for a long time. And so it comes back to how are we making these jobs more attractive? You know, there's only a couple solutions for this. Obviously, technology is one of them. How are solutions like us at home base helping teams do more with less? Obviously, immigration, but there's also labor force participation. So that's what we're really focused on. How do we make these jobs more attractive? How do we help small businesses recruit folks back into the labor force? Because ultimately, we're going to have to do that in the face of declining demographics. Absolutely. John Waldman, home base CEO and founder. Thanks so much for taking the time. Here with us this morning on Yahoo Finance. You guys coming up? The sequel of Knives Out is coming to the big screen. You've got the details on the other side. The short break. You hear the music. You know what time it is. Time for a couple of times. Two stories, one minute each. We start with this Netflix heads to the big screen. The sequel of Knives Out will be released in theaters for one week around Thanksgiving before debuting on the streaming platform. This is the first for the company which has long been against giving theaters and early release here. However, it's done tandem releases in the past. Mudbound was one of those theatrical productions that also released in tandem on Netflix. One of the first I believe they actually tested with that. Knives Out, I've seen the first one. I think this is so good. Yes. I'm excited about this. I don't know if that'll go and see it in the theater, but it's coming out one week. Right, exactly. So I don't know what the impetus is. Soz? Hey, if the James Bond guy's in an on-watchin' never heard of this thing before but of Daniel first, you never saw the last Knives Out? Never even heard of it. You guys see that. I'm excited about this. I like James Bond. I like Daniel Craig. He's a very far cry from James Bond in this movie. Let me just tell you that. I got you. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Up. That was it. Okay, sauce. All right. Let's, I think I'm doing the attessa and trucks for the holidays.

2800," All right, let's, I think I'm doing the attessa and trucks for the holidays. Elon Musk says Tesla will deliver for semi truck ever to Pepsi Co in December. Pepsi ordered 100 trucks in 2017. Our production was expected to begin in 2019. And this is quite the truck. I remember when Tesla initially unveiled it, believe it, it's supposed to get 500 miles in a full charge. It is very, it is very intimidating looking truck. But I think really it's going to give a good snapshot to what is possible with electric trucking and how much perhaps more infrastructure charging infrastructure. We still need in this country. It's coming, but we still need it and we need it now. Yeah, and this not to be confused with the cyber truck that had a rock thrown at it and still had the window cracked. This is the semi version that Tesla back in 2017 had racked up early orders from the likes of JB Hunt, I believe it was Pepsi Walmart. They had some major purchase orders. Then it just came down to delivery. And at first I believe that timeline was more closer to 2020 that eventually got pushed out. Yeah, and the cyber truck VT's was coming too. So that's, there was also a little, a little bit of baby news on that, I guess. All right, coming up in the next hour, you got lots more jobs coverage coming your way. Even as we watch the markets go down, we will all be back in the same location on Monday as we will see whether this selling continues. I hope it's not Nikis. Yeah. Let's do that. All right. Welcome to Yahoo Finance. It's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Blickery and here's what I am watching today.

2801," Finance, it's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Blyckery and here's what I am watching today. Good news is bad news. Stocks slump as a jobs report misses expectations, but it's a lower unemployment rate that gives the Fed more food for thought. It may be space to hike further. The housing market increasingly looks like the first dominant of fall amid declining prices and rising mortgage rates. We're gonna speak with the wet bush securities analysts on the outlook for home builders. And could President Biden's move on marijuana change lives and will it impact his standing ahead of the midterms? We're gonna take a look at the stocks moving in that space. But first, let's take a look at the stocks after that jobs report. And this is a big one of the week here. And we can see the Dow, well, let's take a look. The Dow down just slightly here. Looks like it's off about 407 points. Maybe a little bit more than slightly. We got the Nasdaq down about two and a half percent and the S&P 500 down 1.8%. Now the bond market, another story guys. We've seen a lot of volatility in this space. Let's see if we can get some quotes here. We got the 10 year up to 3.89%. And that is a six basis point move. We got the five year at 4.13% in the 30 year at 3.86%. And we wanna get more on the market with, yeah, who finances in S foray. And in S, you are watching the report. You are charting the reaction to it live on the Wi-Fi interactive, you know, men's work by the way. You know, people's work, let me get. What are some of the numbers sticking out to you after we've had the opportunity to dig into the report? Well, I think that wage gains are still too hot. Even though wage gains came down from August, so which was 5.2 to 5%. That is still too hot. That is to say that the Fed has run way to continue hiking rates. And that's why you saw the market reaction. I also thought it was interesting. The number of people who are employed part time for economic reasons. And we've got that number there on a chart for you. And this has seen a decline for the third straight month. So these are individuals that would have preferred to work full time, but they're working part time because either their hours got cut or because they're unable to find full time work. So that number is declining. Again, assign that the labor market while it may be softening a bit, it is still not softening enough for the Fed to pivot. All right, thank you for that report here in S. And we want to continue the labor market discussion and conversation. Check on the roads ahead for the U.S. economy. And for that, we have Gus Vosher, joining us now, PNC Financial Services Group, Chief Economist. And let me just ask you your initial reaction to the report, Gus, and then anything that sticks out to you. Yeah, so this is a good report. The Fed wants to see slower job growth. I think they prefer to even see even slower job growth in this. But certainly we have seen job growth slow over the course of 2022 is the Fed has raised rates. And that should allow the labor market to cool off as we head into 2023. All right. And then we were just listening to it. And as give some of the statistics, so when you dig into the report, some of the demographic breakdowns may surprise people, maybe some reversals and trends, what did you pick out? Well, certainly we saw the labor force participation rate decline. That's bad news from the Fed's perspective. They want to see more people looking for work. Instead, we saw fewer people. And so that means a tight labor market. And so that makes it more difficult for the Fed means they may have to raise rates a bit more. On the other hand, we did see a bit softer wage growth down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is we are seeing a cooling off in the labor market, but it remains too hot from the Fed's perspective. And they're going to need to raise rates more to cool off some of those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy right now. And I've heard some economists calling this report a Goldilocks report. You look at the stock reaction, definitely to the downside, but maybe that's the bad news as good news here, because the Fed doesn't want to see stock prices go up. As some of the, I believe it was, New Calcash Cari said definitively over a month ago, what are we to make of this in light of the bad news as good news as bad meme? And that kind of confuses people, especially some of us in the business sometimes. Yeah, so what we want is job growth that is slowing to a more sustainable pace. So even over the last.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,18,2022-10-07 15:06:32
2802," plus in the business sometimes. Yeah, so what we want is job growth that is slowing to a more sustainable pace. So, you know, even over the last three months, we've added about 370,000 jobs per month on average. The labor force just simply can't support that. So we need to see much slower job growth that's consistent with underlying growth in the population where not there yet, we're moving in the right direction. So, you know, obviously if we're adding a lot of jobs in the economy, that means more income, that means more consumer spending, but at the same time it's contributing to high inflation. So what we want is okay news from the job market, not good news, but, you know, indications that job growth is slowing and that, you know, we are reaching an equilibrium where those wage pressures in the economy are lessening. And how about the other part of the Fed's mandate inflation? So we have maximum employment, stable prices, interpreted to mean 2% inflation, obviously far above that. But what are you expecting out of some of the readings? And how does that fit into the expectations? Everybody waiting with baited breath for that eventual Fed pivot? Yeah, no, we are starting to see inflation slow. I think it peaked over the summer. Obviously we've seen a big drop in energy prices, although we'll have to see what happens with the new OPEC production cuts. Wage growth is slowing, so that should help bring down inflation. It's gonna be difficult. You know, we probably won't see that 2% inflation until some time in early 2024, but we are moving in the right direction. I think the Fed wants to see both a slowing in the job market and indications that inflation is moving decisively towards 2% before they stop raising rates. I don't think that'll be some time until early in 2023. So, you know, if the Fed is gonna be looking at the data as they come in and we need to see that slowing in inflation and slower job growth that the Fed is going to let up. And you mentioned the energy market before. I'm stirring it at WTI crude prices at above $91 per barrel. And it was about a week or two ago that it seemed to be about $8 fewer than that. And I'm just wondering, what do the current energy prices say to you? There are people hoping that there would be some mitigation to help out the consumers here, but we had OPEC plus step in, reduce their outlook or reduce what they say they're going to pump by 2.1 million barrels per day. They're already in deficit. What are you making of the energy market and its effect on the US economy here? Yeah, so obviously the OPEC production cuts are not good news for oil prices, for inflation in the United States. That being said, a lot of OPEC members were already below their quotas. And so I don't think we're gonna see is, you know, that 2.1 barrel per day cut. But I think we, you know, we're going to get less help on inflation from lower energy prices. But I think the other impacts of the Fed rate heights in terms of a slowing in job growth, a slowing in demand for consumer durables, that type of thing, that will help reduce in those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy, even if OPEC keeps production low. Even if lots of ifs in this business here appreciate your insights on this jobs. Friday, Gus Foshet, PNC Financial Services Group, Chief Economist. All right, not the kind of cut you want. Let's take a look at these shares of Levi Strauss, the stock looks like it's down 9% and that's after the clothing company beat earnings estimates, although reporting a mis one revenue, Levi noting continued supply chain disruptions primarily in the U.S., and that's resulting in estimated miss sales of approximately 30 to 40 million dollars. Now we spoke with Levi Strauss, the CEO, earlier today, and here's what he had to say about the company's road ahead. Let's take a listen. But the next few quarters, and if things do tighten, that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about how do we manage through the immediate crisis, which is in the near tail. But as a company and a brand, we will get out of it and we get out of it stronger. Now a fairly positive reaction from Levi's CFO, we're going to have to wait and see how things eventually shake up for the jeans giant, and tell you what, coming up after this collateral damage, the Fed might bring down the housing market to its knees in order to tame inflation, but does that mean a full-on crash?

We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders. We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders. We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders. Welcome back. You can call it the perfect storm for the housing market with high mortgage rates, a hawkish fed and recession on the horizon. The last time home prices fell this quickly was during the global financial crisis. And though home prices have fallen from peaks and most major US cities, they're still some way above the 2019 levels. But home builder sentiment has been downed dwindling. So what does the demand picture look like and what's the investment argument? Let's get into that conversation with Jamie Canless, Wedbush Securities Senior Vice President of Equity Research. Let me just ask you the headline question here. What are we to make of the latest data here and with these soaring prices and home affordability in the crosshairs? Good morning, thanks for having me. Longer term, I think the picture for shelter demand, whether that's for sale housing, for rent housing or multi-family for rent, we still think is very strong. And you look at rent growth, double-digit percentages up pretty much the entire year for single-family and for multi-family. And what we're hearing from the builders is that even with these higher mortgage rates, if they can find a way to get to the affordable payment, whether it's a function of buying down the rate a little bit, maybe taking a little bit off the base price of the home, if they can solve for that monthly payment that the buyer needs, then the buyer is still willing to purchase the home. We think also the demographic tailwind of the millennials that are strongly fully-in-household formation phase right now, along with the Gen Zs, which is also a very large population demographic. There's lots of people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,20,2022-10-07 15:14:25
2804," the millennials that are strongly fully in household formation phase right now, along with the Gen Z, which is also a very large population demographic. There's lots of tailwinds out there, but I think near term, you're absolutely right. This is a much trickier environment that I think the builders would have expected, especially given how strong the beginning of the year was. And there's almost a substitution effect going on that I've been able to glean from your nose, correct me if I'm wrong, but given the fact that there's not as much demand perhaps for new homes for people to buy rental properties, we're seeing a surge in demand as those as people are forced to pay a shallot money for rent instead of a mortgage. How are those trends looking? They're actually looking pretty good. And what we've heard from our home builders is that you're not going to completely replace consumer demand with the demand from the single family and the builder rent landlords, but it is a more affordable option for people. And it also for my home builder or for the home builders recover, I can give them an option to be able to sell maybe some homes that they couldn't have sold in this mortgage rate environment. So I think I'm going to fully replace the consumer, but yes, I think the demand for housing, rental housing especially is out there and it's providing affordable housing for the consumer, but also means of selling some homes that the builders have maybe built an expectation, the consumer wanting them and now they're going to sell it to these institutional landlords. Either way, it's the emergence of this new fire class over the last decade. I think it's been a win-win for both consumers as well as the building industry. That's interesting. When you say fire, talk about finance and insurance real estate, I believe, just in terms of input costs, we can look at the materials and we can get into lumber price, we can also get into wages that are paid. And I think that's appropriate to talk about because we just got a bunch of data this morning from the BLS on the job front, how about these sources of costs for these businesses? So for the, our thesis around the jobs that as long as we're seeing some type of continued job creation that is going to be good for demand, good for the industry because typically job growth leads us into recovery and job declines typically proceed tougher times for the builders. So good to see that we are still growing the jobs picture. In terms of input costs, what we've seen is that lumber prices, which have been extremely volatile for most of COVID, actually had a pretty benign quarter, this past quarter in the third quarter, lumber prices, framing prices are down about 15%. So if you think about a little bit of a tailwind there from from lower lumber costs, helping to offset some of the costs that the builders are having to pay to buy down mortgages and maybe cut prices a little bit. So a little bit of relief in a tougher environment. And then from on the wage front, what we've seen is that affordability up until this meteoric rise and mortgage rates from 3% 18 months ago to nearly 7% I think this morning is where they're sitting. Even with wage growth that we've seen out there, it's hard for affordability to keep up when you see that type of meteoric surge and mortgage rates. Yes, and let's get into some of the investment opportunities for people in the audience. You have a couple of names that I'm interested in going over. Green Break Partners, Builders for Source, Building Products, Masonite, any of those names you care to describe here and what you're seeing in those stocks. Yeah, absolutely. So Green Break, we have a new trading on it. But if you think about where some of the pain has been in housing, we've seen I think a little bit more of it outweft. Green Break actually does the majority of their business in Atlanta and Dallas, which are two markets that have held up pretty well and haven't really felt some of the effects of layoffs on the tech sector or the tech sector like a Raleigh in an Austin felt. So we're new traded on that name, but I think if you're trying to avoid some of the trouble spots in housing right now, Green Break is an interesting name. Builders for Source is a company that supplies lumber and other products that go into the home. They're about 10% of the domestic building products market now. The decline that we saw in lumber prices has passed quarter. Typically is not as good for them, but if you think about their ability to grow more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,21,2022-10-07 15:19:18
2805," market now. The decline that we saw in lumber prices has passed quarter. Typically is not as good for them, but if you think about their ability to grow market share and get bigger in this environment, especially because they don't just sell to single-family builders. They also sell to multi-family, selling to commercial, which we've seen commercial construction spending actually start to rebound over the last six months. So even though they may be a little bit slower to man for their single-family product, they do have other avenues that they can sell into. We're going to have to leave it there, but appreciate your insights into the housing and construction markets. Jay McCannless, White Bush, Security, and Senior Vice President of Equity Research. It's been a struggle guarding against inflation over the last year. Don't we know that crypto hasn't seen or hasn't been the hedge that some thought it could be. Gold is face, headwinds from the sky high US dollar and real estate is a long-term play. Then there's inflation protected government debt like tips and I bonds, which operate differently, but both and to guard you from asset price erosion on the ladder now, since the rate jumped up at the end of last year. There have been over $27 billion in I bond sales, but is the market still hot? Joining us to discuss is Yahoo! Finance is Carrie Hanon. Now, how is this market looking right now because I need some inflation protection? How can we get in on this? We all do. And specifically looking at I bonds. This is the time to buy it. It's safe, not sexy, right? These are backed by the US government. So you're guaranteed to get your investment back. They follow inflation. The rate is adjusted twice a year in November and may loosely based on the consumer price index. And there's a formula that they use, but that's the main one. Now, this is important to talk about right now because we're coming up on the adjustment in November. So if you buy these bonds between now and the end of October, they're paying 9.62%. Now, the experts I spoke to expect in November this to drop down to about 6%, they'll announce that probably around October 13th. There's some great things about this investment, but of course there are some limitations. I think it really is a smart idea for many people to set a little aside here. But here are the caveats that you need to know. There is a $10,000 limit each year. You can play around with that. There are a few ways to bump that up, but essentially it's $10,000. You can't buy these I bonds in your retirement accounts, right? So you can't buy it in your 401K or for your IRA, that sort of thing. This is for cash. You have other savings, right? And you need to hold it for at least one year before you cash it out. And if you cash it out before five years, you'll lose a little bit of the interest. So it's not as liquid as some investments might be, but my goodness. It's really a nice, safe opportunity that I think it's worth taking a look at right now and how we approach this thing. So those are just a couple of the caveats. Treasury direct. This is a do-it-yourself kind of thing. You go right to the US Treasury Department, to their Treasury Direct and set up an account right there. And you can get rolling again. There are ways that you can bump it up maybe by using this. You can buy gifts for your children, nice holiday gifts, and have that $10,000 amount as well. All right. If I'm buying these as gifts, is the recipient going to get some tax benefits? That's my way of backing into the next question. I want to, well, if I can reduce my tax bill at the end of the year or in April of next year, I'm all about that. Yeah, actually, this is a great investment for this reason. The interest paid out is free from state and local taxes. Now, federal tax does apply. But again, there are ways if you cash out and you redeem your bond for higher education costs, there is a way that you can save some on the taxation from a federal perspective. But it has to be for higher education costs. And you can find all those details on the Treasury Direct site in order to make sure you've got it all straight. And we know you also write about this for us here at Yahoo Finance and the Benefit of our Viewers. And thank you for that report, Carrie Hannan. All right. Time and far for our chart of the day.

I'm just gonna say what everybody's thinking we need fewer jobs we need to hire unemployment rate all the analysis I'm seeing about the September jobs rates as basically all shocks we thought we were hoping unemployment would go up and we thought the jobs number would be lower and why does everybody want that to happen. So the Federal Reserve has a reason to us.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,23,2022-10-07 15:27:48
2807," thought we were hoping unemployment would go up and we thought the jobs number would be lower. And why does everybody want that to happen? So the Federal Reserve has a reason to slow down its interest rate hikes, but with 263,000 new jobs slower than we've seen earlier this year, but still pretty strong, very tight job market. Everybody now is almost certain the Fed's going to hike another 75 basis points or three quarters of a point in November. So you know, puzzle this one out, we get a pretty good jobs report and the stock market falls by nearly 2%. That's the kind of fun house economy we're in. I think a lot of people just wish, could we get through the slowdown and the job market we need to get inflation under control and get to the other side of this? We're just not there yet. No, we are not. But let's move on to something that we are near and that is towards a potential pardon by lots. Let's say anybody who's been convicted on possession of marijuana, at least at the federal level, with encouragement by Joe Biden for the states to do something similar. Now, cynics are going to say, well, we're a month away from the midterm elections. Others saying this is really too little too late, but very welcome nonetheless. You're take? Well, it could be too little too late and it could be political, but it still might be a smart thing for Biden to do. So important to point out, as you said, Jared, he is partening people convicted for marijuana, simple marijuana possession at the federal level. Most people who've been prosecuted for pot possession, that happens at the state level or the local level. So this will not affect most people who have those types of convictions on their record or who might actually be in jail for the time being. But you're right, Biden, you know, it's an important symbolic move. And here's the politics of it. About two-thirds of Americans now say marijuana should be legal. We're seeing many states legalize marijuana. It's destigmatized and so forth. It's not really considered a social problem anymore. And Biden's giving a nod to that. But marijuana prosecutions largely affect minorities, minority populations. And because we're our month away from the midterms, this clearly is a signal to Biden to try to get some of those. People get out and vote. This also comes after he canceled a lot of student debt. So young people tend to favor forgiveness of marijuana offenses more than older people. So Biden is trying to appeal to younger voters and minority voters and not just get them to vote Democrat, but get them to vote at all because turnout is going to be a big issue in the midterm elections. Rick, I got to call our attention here to the Wi-Fi interactive where I'm looking at our cannabis heat map. And actually as you see cannabis stocks off, we see till-rate down 14% here. Let me show you the two-day because we were looking at some monster gains yesterday. So net net we're still up, but really volatile price action here. Just wanted to bring that to everybody's attention. And I want to say thank you for that report, Rick Newman. All right, coming up, let's see. We got another blow. You can add $570 million to the crypto hack ledger as a finance back token becomes the latest victim. We discussed that and we'll hear from Lisa's crypto girl.

2808," Five hours later Welcome back. We're taking a look at the market here. We can see the Dow underwater by 1.6% or nearly 500 points. The S&P 500 is I'm looking at the Wi-Fi Interactive Off 2% the Nasdaq down nearly 3% right now and it is the energy market that is in the green and nothing else. Look at tech. That is down 3.25% followed by consumer discretionary and communication services. Looking at the bond market we have the 10-year Tino yield that is up by about five basis points. Rounding it out, I'm not going to call this a Goldilocks report. We'll leave that for some of the commentators. Another major hack in the world of crypto. Gen Sean Burger has the details and Gen we see these things pop up from time to time. And we have yet another one. What are the details? Hey there Jared that's right good morning to you. Binance's BNB chain is back up and running after a hacker made off with roughly 2 million in BNB tokens after exploiting a vulnerability in that network. Those tokens worth roughly $570 million were targeted by an attacker late Thursday. Binance CEO CZ saying that he thinks that only 100 million was actually stolen and BNB chain tweeting that 7 million of those assets were indeed frozen. Now CZ writing in a tweet quote an exploit on a cross chain bridge BSC token hub resulted in extra BNB. We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC. The issue is contained now your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience so called cross chain bridges are tools that allow the transfer of tokens from one blockchain to another that BNB chain was targeted enabling hackers to move tokens off the network. The company reportedly saying it had worked with network validators essentially people who confirm transactions on the blockchain to pause creation of new blocks and then suspending all transaction processing while that team of developers investigated. The breach take a look at that BNB token this morning it's down roughly about 3.5% Jared. 100 million 570 million pretty soon we're talking about real Satoshi's thank you for that. Yahoo finances Jen Schoenberger. All right sticking with the crypto space FTX is expanding its partnership with visa globally by tapping into 40 new markets. More on that let's bring in visa ahead of crypto Kai Sheffield a Kai tell us about this partnership now that you have with FTX please. Thanks for having me and so we think this is a big deal for the crypto industry really moving from just speculation and trading to utility when you have one of the leading global exchanges and FTX working with visa to make it easy for consumers to spend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,25,2022-10-07 15:36:37
2809," came from just speculation and trading to utility when you have one of the leading global exchanges and FTX, working with Visa to make it easy for consumers to spend from a balance held on their platform at any of the 80 million merchants across the world that accept Visa. So we're incredibly excited to work with them. All right, and let me ask you about the price of Bitcoin itself. It seems like it's been floundering around $20,000 here. I'm not asking you for a one year prediction or an end-of-year prediction, but just in general, with the price of crypto assets depressed as we've seen them, maybe perhaps in a crypto winter, how has Visa been using this space to maybe institutionalize, build out its institutional base here for its customers? Yeah, I think regardless of the price of any asset on any day, we're seeing continued interest from consumers, as well as from entrepreneurs and builders and developers that are coming into the space. And we think increasingly, it's developers that are going to build the future of payments. And so we're using this time to really look at how can we help partner with them and help them access our network to build new payment products on top of these technologies. And Kai, I'm going to play Devils Advocate here because when we think about crypto and the original white paper going back to 2009, I believe it was, and the D5 movement that is decentralized finance, it was huge, it seems like a year or two ago, everybody was becoming a Bitcoin maximalist, we're a D5 maximalist, and there was supposed to be a new regime. And yet we've seen a lot of traditional finance takeover roles here. We're talking about Visa, a traditional financial finance company here. How does crypto fit into the trad-fi space and has anything fundamentally changed over the last few years? Yeah, we see decentralization as more of a spectrum rather than a binary. And we think it takes both worlds coming together for payment products to be built that can serve mainstream consumers. And so a lot of the consumers' emergence, they don't have an ideological bet around the underlying technologies that they use. They just want seamless, convenient experiences to store the value that and spend the value that they have. And so we think that this is really the next phase for the industry is having traditional networks working together with leading platforms like FTX. And when it comes to the actual use of crypto as payments and the traditional payment system, we haven't really seen full adoption just yet, even in countries like El Salvador where there's a huge government push, just how do you see this rolling out in the adoption cycle? We see a lot of opportunity for stablecoins. And I think when you combine stablecoins with global networks like Visa, it really opens up a number of new payment flows like remittances and cross-border payouts. Where now you can have a consumer that can receive a remittance cross-border, but then they can offer it by spending at any merchant down the street. So we think you kind of have to have both, but there's clear demand for these dollar digital currencies. And we think we can make them as easy to spend as any other currency that consumers use today. And you're gonna get some guidance by the Federal Reserve probably by 2030 or last a little bit of a joke there. I wanna go back actually to your rollout. Now this is a program that is being rolled out in 40 countries across Latin America, Europe and Asia, Latin America is first. We've seen big adoption there for various reasons. I don't think it's surprising or coincidental that there are huge inflation rates in a lot of these countries. But what's your experience and what's your decision at Visa and why Latin America first? Yeah, I think FTX has been excited about opportunities to bring, they have a card program live today in the US. They wanna bring it to new markets and markets that are growing very quickly for them. And I think it's very clear that there is demand for dollars outside the United States and stablecoins can become a way that people can access dollars now through the FTX card. They have a way to spend those dollars. And so we're seeing a lot of interesting growth in that market across the Latin American region. All right, we're gonna leave it there. Visa's head of crypto, Kai Sheffield. Thank you for showing us your face today. And coming up odds of a 75 basis point hike from the Fed.

As a labor market cools, some companies ease a pace of hiring to cut costs and others found it easier to hire as more people look to get into the workforce. It's small business owners, they're falling behind, who finances Danny Romero has that story, Danny, the details, please. Yeah, so small business owners are really struggling to find labor. I spoke with a small business owner here in New York City and she tells me that she's had to now hire high school students. Young as 17 years old, she says that these challenges have really prompted her to come up with creative ways to incentivize these students. Not pay them, excuse me, she feeds them two to three times a day. Teenagers eat a lot, I know this, I was once very a very large teenager. Buies groceries for them, buys them footwear, uniform, and not only that, but she's also even thrown in free movie tickets at times. She's also increased her pay about 10% for her staffing. So she is really doing anything and everything and she's not the only one. I also spoke with a franchisee owner who sells custom made tires and he tells me that the common question that he's getting from candidates is, can I do this job remotely? Tires, yes. Okay, got it. And he was telling me that it is nearly impossible for him to have a remote style business model for what he does. And so, you know, another stark data point is that from the National Federation of Independent Business found that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,27,2022-10-07 15:44:52
2811," motestyle business model for what he does. And so, you know, another stark data point is that from the National Federation of Independent Business found that nearly half of small businesses couldn't hire enough workers in September. And over 23% of available positions went unfilled. That is a 48 year high. So yes, data does suggest that there is a cool off in the labor market, but these smaller firms are really feeling the pinch Jared. Higher wages, all these incentives, free food. There's no free lunch, but the free food, free movie passes. This is expensive. We're experiencing inflation. So how are businesses dealing with these cost increases? Yeah. So inflation still remains a big challenge for these small business owners. You know, prices have gone up across the board. And so, for example, eggs are nearly 80% above what they were last year. So some of these business owners are actually had to take on more debt in order to stay afloat. So not a really pretty picture for Main Street right now. All right. Thank you for delivering that report. And we want to stick with the housing market here. So the labor market might be showing some signs of cooling, but there are pockets of the economy that are still proving fairly resilient. Specialty trade contractors added 18,000 jobs in September. That is one area of the workforce that has been battling with a shortfall of skilled talent and older workers eyeing the exit. Boston based company Forge is looking to change that by making the career path more accessible. It's CEO Mark Hasdorf joins me now. And Mark, just wondering what you're seeing in the latest numbers that we got from the BLS this morning on the jobs front? Yeah, Jerry, thanks for having me on. I think the latest numbers are really interesting and really unsurprising in many ways. I think what's more interesting is we've been running out of people on the trades for almost 30 years now. And the average age of people on the trades has been rising for 30 years. It's past 46 years old. The average age of only tuition is 60 now. The jobs report and what we're seeing is kind of a culmination of a huge macro trend in the economy and it's only getting worse right now. Mark, let's dig into that macro trend. I've noticed anecdotally myself and you can probably back this up with your expertise and actual data. But when the federal government started guaranteeing student loans way back, what was it the late 2000s, the odds 2008, 2009, 10, I noticed among people some of my peers, their kids weren't necessarily going into these trade schools. They were very geared and put into colleges because of those easier borrowing costs. I'm just wondering, are we seeing a shift as a result of the pandemic or maybe we're seeing a reversal of that or we're seeing people opt for these trade schools instead of that four year degree? Yeah, well, I can definitely tell you, although there is a stigma in the trades and it's been harder and harder to get young people to go into it, we run a paid apprentice program where we bring people in, we pay them to learn, we're getting hundreds of applicants for every single program. We run programs of 12 people, so I can tell you at least here in Boston, there's a lot of young people that would love a debt free career working with their hands. There's just not that many on-ramps to get into the trades for people today. And is there any sort of public-private partnership we know that these tend to accelerate interest in a lot of these programs, anything you can take advantage for better or worse in that field? Yeah, I think as part of the infrastructure package that was passed a few months ago by the Biden administration, there's absolutely workforce development dollars available. We got a small grant from Massachusetts as they look to bring more and more people into the trades. Without some kind of public partnership, public-private partnership, we're not gonna have anyone to rebuild this country in another decade. So I think something has to be done in the administration's well aware at this point. And when we get back to the university versus a trade school kind of debate here, what does it look like in terms of cost? What does somebody potentially save by going to a trade school over a four-year university? Well, so with forage, they save a lot, right? If we just kind of average out the average university education of $100,000 and say people start earning when they're 22, 23 years old, we pay people $15 an hour to do nothing but learn. When they graduate, we give them a W2 job and start them out at...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,28,2022-10-07 15:49:42
2812," who 23 years old, we pay people $15 an hour to do nothing but learn. When they graduate, we give them a W2 job and start them out at just about a $50,000 income with health insurance. And they can start that at 18, 19 years old and we can get people to a six figure income under a decade. So I think the mantra that you have to go to college to make money is actually not true anymore and there's a ton of amazing jobs out there that lead to a six figure income in the trades. And we have a minute left here. I'll give you the floor. Anything you will, anything else that you'd like to say to our viewers? Sure. I think that, you know, we talked about the odds and some of the ships that happened then. I think what's really interesting to me is I've talked to older people in the trades. If you go back to the 50s, a doctor, a lawyer, an electrician, a plumber, they went to the same bar, they went to the same church, they were all in the Rotary Club, they were all peers, they were all master crafts people. And that really started to change in the late 1960s with the push to send everyone to college. We have to change that in America. Being in the trades is a respected thing. You create an enormous amount of value. You're rebuilding this country and Ford really hopes that we can be a big part of that going forward. One more reason to support your point. Arguably, we have too many lawyers just going to throw that out there. Ford CEO and founder of Mark Cazdorf, Cort Mark Cazdorf, excuse me, thank you for joining us today. All right, it looks like we want to take a quick check of the markets here, still seeing a down day on Wall Street. Looks like the Dow is off nearly 500 points a little bit more than last time. S&P 500 off about 1% actually a little bit more than 2% and the NASDAQ really leading the way down. That's off 345 points. Coming up ahead of schedule, it wasn't expected to happen this year, but Tesla's semi-trucks will be rolling out for Pepsi in December. Should Elon Musk thank the inflation reduction act? That's up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,29,2022-10-07 15:53:55
2813," MUSIC Welcome back. Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeted out last night that the company has started production of its long, awaited, all-electric semi-truck and will make its first deliveries to Pepsi Co in December for more on the story we bring in Yago Finance's prize Supermanian Yago Finance's senior auto correspondent to break down this latest news and we didn't know this was coming this early. We saw the truck, we saw the we saw it break slightly in the demonstration but this big honking semi going to be rolled out by the end of the year. Is this just another one of those dates that we expect to be postponed or is this for real? Yeah, you know, welcome news for people that are looking forward to the semi-truck. Is it an Elon distraction here? I don't know, but because it kind of came out of nowhere. He had mentioned that the truck would go into production soon. We first saw it in 2017. So it's been over almost five years and now he's starting production and it will be delivered to Pepsi on the first of December. I reached out to Pepsi to get Con we haven't heard back from him yet but it's still a big deal for Tesla to get the semi out there. It's a big space, right? There's a lot of competition there between like Dymler and Volvo and even Nikola, right? So it's good that this truck's out there now and it's going to be some big tax incentives too. So you want Elon to push that out so fast? Well, you know, it's interesting too because Elon Musk has to raise potentially hundreds of millions of dollars just because of the higher interest rate environment. We know that he has to finance that Twitter purchase. Some people are estimating billion dollars, billions of dollars that have to be raised for this. Meanwhile, Tesla is still worth as much as the entire European banking sector. So he does have a lot of collateral there. He has a lot of stock that he could sell. Just wondering if you're a take on all of this and how it might fit together. You know, it's funny. The market is valuing the electric kind of first-movers so highly, so richly. We saw also Porsche now worth more than Volkswagen, which spun that out a few weeks ago. So you're seeing that market really reward that here. One thing I want to note though back to the truck stuff is that there's going to be this $40,000 incentive for purchasers of these trucks class eight electric vehicles. That's a big deal. You couple that with the, on the production side, the battery incentives, incentives are kind of bringing on the cost about a third. So you can see why this truck stuff is so huge. And companies that are involved with that could be kind of like a play here potentially for people looking to sell HSBC and getting to New York as level C. Well, hey, with all those rebates or credits or what have you, if December is in fact a delivery date for a bunch of these, well, then they go on this year's book. So it could be in advance, or it could be kind of a gaming and the accounting. But hey, if they get those trucks out there on the road, I'd be interested to see one as well. So for a minute here, you talked about that Porsche spin-off from Volkswagen. How is that going in anything else in the EV space that you're looking at here? Well, it sounds like the Porsche spin-off has gone quite well. The stock was up a lot yesterday. I think today must be down. But it seems like the market is rewarding that Porsche is going to have some more information on their electric platform. They're making a new platform where they can actually build a lot of these cars modulately like on this electric PPE platform. So we're going to see more about that. I think they're kind of set up there for this next transition, especially in Europe where we're talking about companies with slow growth and not much hype. Porsche was a huge story for that, not only IPO market, but also the European equity market, too. Yeah, I know. Porsche was a huge IPO for them. Just haven't heard a lot. For that matter, we haven't seen a lot of IPOs in the US this year either. All right. Thank you for that report. Pros, supermanian, got to say goodbye to you. Before we say goodbye to everybody else here, we want to recap those jobs numbers that we got this morning. As you can see on your screen, we got 263,000 jobs handily beating the Wall Street estimate of 255,000 that critical unemployment rate that the Fed maybe wants to see edge higher. Guess what? It's lower now, 3.5% versus 3.7% expected. And then 5%. That is the average hourly earnings. Your over your came in as expected, but still relatively high. Now we want to get a check out the markets where we are seeing on the Yagel Finance Interactive Nasdaq down 3%. Let's take a look at the weekly totals right now. Over the last five days, you can see that line. It wasn't the green quite a bit now a little bit less, but still looking at gains of 1.5% for the week. Let's take a look at the Dow as well. We can see that is low.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,30,2022-10-07 15:58:27
2814, past five days. You can see that line. It wasn't the green quite a bit now a little bit less but still looking at gains of one and a half percent for the week. Let's take a look at the Dow as well. We can see that is looking like it will end the week two and a half percent up. And let's get a check of the S&P 500. That is up 2% this trailing five days. That's going to do it for us right now. You can check me out on Monday morning and for more we're going to be on later this afternoon. Have a great weekend. We're going to be on Monday. We're going to be on Monday. We're going to be on Monday. We're going to be on Monday. We're going to be on Monday. We're going to be on Monday.

2815," A23, what are some of the major revenue obstacles you and the team are up against for next year? Look, we see opportunity. We don't look at revenue as being an obstacle. We have the youngest fleet in the industry. We have a sizable yet nimble fleet. When we look at our demand picture, our demand continues to be very, very strong. Even against the backdrop of a lot of different world events, economic events, our customer tends to be a higher level customer than that of our peers. So while not insulated from any sort of recession area issues or economic malaise, our customers tend to be more insulated and more resilient from that. So we don't look at as revenue opportunities as being obstacles. We see many opportunities. And that's really been demonstrated when you look at our first half and our second quarter pricing. I think if I recall correctly, on our first half, our net per diems were up 18%. And yes, I said 18%. And if you look at our peers for the first half, they were roughly about flat. So everything we see in all of our indicators, whether it's our booking curve, what the consumer is spending on board today, all indicators are pointing that 2023 is setting up to be a phenomenal year for us. What type of margins relative to when you were seeing full vessels, people booking on a very healthy basis? And when do you expect that you'll kind of re-assume some of those stature? Yeah, look, pre-COVID, we were setting record level margins. We had EBITDA margins roughly at about in the low 30s. And I would be naive to tell you that we're not seeing some sort of inflationary pressure today. But we believe that's short-term pressure. That's near-term pressure. And all signs that we're seeing, at least from the cost front, we're starting to see easing in all the key commodities, whether it's proteins, fruits and vegetables, consumables, the like. But the other side of that coin is we're also able to go on a very strong pricing. And again, as I said earlier, that's been evidenced by the fact of our performance in both Q1 and Q2 of this year. And if you look at Q3 and our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per diems are expected to be up in the high single digits. So again, there's inflation is real. It is starting to level off. We are going to see some near-term pressure on margins. But we don't believe that this is going to be a long-term sustainable margin issue. As we look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvement significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic. Marketually here, let's talk about another important cost to input that has nothing to do with commodities. And that's people, right? Which seemingly every industry has been struggling with. How many people want to get on a ship as an employee these days? And how are they interacting also with the change and rules that you guys have been making? Look, people want to travel. People want to experience the world. They want to see the world in all forms of fashion. It doesn't matter if it's a consumer. It's our employees. Anybody. We're here in New York today. We expect a full ship, the ship is sailing this evening. It's going to be almost that full capacity, limited by our own own restrictions as we launch a new vessel. But demand is off the charts. Consumers are past COVID. The world is past COVID. Right, but it's not. Employees wise. So you guys aren't having trouble finding good people to staff the ships? No, when you look at our employee base, you have to remember our employee base. They did not receive subsidies during the course of the pandemic. So they wanted to come back to work. They were excited to come back to work. We've only seen employment issues very, you know, on the very margin at best in certain areas. But overall, it has not had any impact on our experience that we offer to all of our guests. Mark, that's good to hear about the premium. I know it's a nice looking ship. And of course, it's taken a while to get to this point, given everything going on in the world. But I also want to ask you too, in terms of the debt position, you know, as you look towards next year, how do you, how you can repay some of that debt? Is it a, is it a share sale? Are you going to try to refinance? Look, we were very deliberate and proactive during the pandemic. So, you know, we had to add a lot of debt to the balance sheet. But when we added debt, we looked at it and we looked at our maturity towers down the road. We wanted to ensure that we had a very clean path coming out of COVID. So, as we look forward over the course of the next two to three years, we have about a billion dollars a year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,32,2022-10-07 16:07:18
2816," down the road. We wanted to ensure that we had a very clean path coming out of COVID. So, as we look forward over the course of the next two to three years, we have about a billion dollars a year, so, you know, plus or minus that's coming due. And we firmly believe, given on our trajectory today, that with our existing cash on hand and our expected organic cash flow, we are going to be able to pay off our debt in the normal course of business by just good old fashion earnings and cash generation. We have no appetite. Our board has no appetite to issue any sort of equity to pay down debt or to deliver. We have the ability. This company is a cash engine machine. And if you look at the at the performance pre-pandemic, we were generating on average about a billion and a half close to two billion dollars of free cash flow. And we were also returning capital to shareholders at the same time. So, again, as we get back to full operations, we expect to be back at full capacity for the second quarter of 2023. And that is by design. We think, given where 2023 and 24 positioning, we have ample room to pay off our debt in the normal course. So, Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla TSA. Yeah, they are moving lower on the day right now by about 1.2 percent. Questions have swirled around the tech titan sales of Tesla shares to finance is deal making coupled with whether he might be too distracted to hit targets at Tesla. Craig Irwin, Roth Capital Partners Senior Research analyst joins us now. Craig, you have a neutral rating and a $250 price target on Tesla. Now that we got that out of the way, help us answer some of these questions here. First and foremost, is Elon Musk too distracted to run both Twitter and Tesla? And what does that mean for Tesla? Just one point for regulatory reasons. They split adjusted price target is 85. The last printed note is pre-split. So, is Elon Musk too distracted to run Tesla? You know, frankly, Tesla is his baby. This company is a great expression of his personality. And he has shown tremendous capability to manage many different things, neural link of the boring company, SpaceX, you know, and other outside ventures. And the intellectual curiosity necessary to execute pretty well there. So, will it possibly take time away from Tesla? Yes. You know, I think the question that probably needs to be asked is, you know, will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And, you know, I'm not the best judge of that. I think you already have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,33,2022-10-07 16:11:29
2817," to Twitter and you know I'm not the best judge of that. I think you already have some pretty clear ideas on Twitter and he does have a history with PayPal and the digital payments space which I think is part of his vision on fixing that asset. So it doesn't bother me for Tesla. I have other reasons that I'm very bearish on the company but I have tremendous respect for what they've done. Well we'll get to those reasons in a second Craig but it doesn't even matter if Elon is distracted. Who cares and I mention that because we have EV tax credits in play that are probably gonna be a big tailwind to Tesla and then we have cars that people just really seem to be obsessed about. Yeah I mean they've done age for a menace job right? They've basically made the automotive industry sexy again. The last time it was sexy was the 1950s. That was when it's would come out of the best universities in the world and say oh my gosh, I wanna work for a car company. Now those same kids are coming out and saying, I wanna work on electric vehicles. I wanna work on future drivetrain technologies. Elon must deserve a lot of that credit because it's his vision and his commitment that's allowed that to take place. Does it matter? Does it really matter for Tesla so much? Not really, the flywheel is rolling, it's running and they have very different issues to manage through over the next couple of years than what they've had to challenge through to date. And whether or not Elon Musk is the one that's the right person to make those decisions, we'll find out, I'm skeptical. I think there's some very challenging things ahead for this company. And if Musk is maybe reducing his intensity with the company, it might not be a bad thing. Craig, I know there's no imminent changes at the top of Tesla, but is there anybody else there who could run the thing besides him? Oh gosh, that's a tough question. I don't think so. I mean, I've talked to a lot of former Tesla executives. I know people that have turned down positions at Tesla that are leaders and they're respect to various. It's a difficult company to work at because Elon Musk is an unreasonable person, not in a bad way, but in a motivating way where he doesn't take no for answer. He wants to learn what you got wrong, why you got it wrong, how you got to do a different to achieve the goal? So yes or no, yes, we got it. No, we didn't. A lot of people aren't well-tooled to work in that environment. And there's a lot of burnout and a lot of turnover as people like to talk about for Tesla with heavy, heavy departures every year. Craig, I only got 30 seconds here. Cold and months, they're coming soon. China and Tesla production, that's going to remain one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns. As it doesn't seem China's going to change their zero COVID policy anytime soon. Yeah, China's going to be tough for them, that's going to determine whether or not they make their numbers this year. 20,000, 20,000 unit myths or 19,000 unit myths is China, right? I don't think this is what's the biggest issue for the company. It's a big issue with competition and alternative equities like Porsche and the upcoming Ford spin-off, large well-established properties that are executing well. You have other examples of some of the SPAC IPOs that are actually showing success. And Tesla has big problems on the horizon as far as this competitive environment. And they don't really have the technology lead that many people claim. Everybody has access, this same database. Imagine that, competition for Tesla, Craig. Thank you so much, Craig Irwin, Rothkapital partner, senior research analyst. I appreciate your time this morning, thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,34,2022-10-07 16:15:52
2818," you you Our That is our growth And inicar andett for all, and and on bringing in and of a very visible real world impact of Fed policy, right? The rate increase that we've seen in mortgages specifically in the effect that the knock-on effect that has on the housing market. What do you think overall about the effectiveness of Fed policy with fighting this current bout of inflation? Well, we haven't had them fight about of inflation in a very long time. So whatever models we had, you know, we have to dust off and see. I think we know that their long lack of facts, yeah, it hits the markets very quickly. It's equity markets, more slowly, housing markets, but things like employment, the peak of facts can be a year off. So it's very hard. You know, it's one of the things that makes it so hard for the Fed to get to a soft or soft-ish landing, which I'm pretty skeptical about. Okay. And so with your skepticism about getting to a soft-ish landing, what would the reality of the economic detriment incurred be if we were to see what many economists are calling for a recession in mid 2023? Well, I mean, I think it could be pretty brutal if the Fed really is hell-bent on having inflation come down as quickly as possible to two or two and a half percent. We have Europe very likely going to recession China. It at least a growth recession by all measures for the amorous session. That's a lot of pressures on us, the dollar is very strong. And interest rates are rising very fast. So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession if that would be lucky. I'd say it could be a tough trade-off for the Fed once the numbers start setting in. I'm a little worried that having gone the wrong way in one direction with the change in their framework and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation, they're now going in the other direction and possibly moving too fast given the long legs. Professor, if the economy does get brutal, like you just suggested, do you think this is a Federal Reserve at some point next year that is back to unwinding these aggressive rate hikes they've been taking recently? So here's the thing, yes, but I think where we're going to land at the end of this and now I'm looking maybe two years ahead is that a level of interest rates higher than we're used to even after inflation comes down. The real interest rate, the premium of the interest rate over the inflation rates, been extraordinarily low since the financial crisis. Some people say it's secular, stagnation, demographic, low productivity inequality, what have you. I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact, it was abnormally low in that period and we're going to get some moving back to being leaning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,35,2022-10-07 16:19:59
2819," I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact, it was abnormally low in that period, and we're gonna get some moving back to being, meaning that interest rates, even when they start coming down, they not come down all that much. So how do we then determine what the sort of natural or stable rate should be, right? Is there any way of sort of gaming that out what that could look like? Very tough. My own research sort of speaks to the 10-year rate, which I think will end up in a higher place than we've been used to before the pandemic. But what's going on with the Fed funds rate, with all the regulation and the financial repression, is a little hard to say. So they really have no idea that's one of the things making it difficult. But if you're asking, I think it'll be higher than we're used to. For consumers right now, what should they be navigating? How can they best navigate, perhaps, even leading into the scenario that you've described? Well, I mean, it's a tough picture where probably headed towards a difficult situation, coming out of a difficult situation. Certainly, I think employment is the key. Everybody's been particularly young people moving jobs every six months or a year. They better think twice about that in this period when it might not be so easy to land on another job. Can I want to switch gears a little bit? Because you focus not just on the US, but on the globe as well. And you and some others are just out with some really interesting research on the real estate market in China. Now, so much attention on the sort of zero-COVID policy and the negative effect that's having on China. But there's some underlying risk here that you illustrate in this research. We're looking now, you look at so-called Tier 3 Chinese cities, some of the smaller cities, although still pretty large, and that there's this excessive housing stock and that there's been really a sharp slowdown in prices and housing prices in those areas. What kind of risk is this presenting for the Chinese economy? Well, I think it's a huge long-term problem with or without the zero-COVID policy. The real estate housing real estate, more generally, commercial real estate infrastructure, has been the go-to policy for China. I did some research a couple of years ago, peak China housing, showing all the factors that suggested we really have come to an end of it. And more recently, my co-author and I have shown that a lot of that is concentrated in the more hidden Tier 3 cities, you know, the Cincinnati's of China, so to speak. I'm not quite sure if you say that Cincinnati's of China could be five and ten million people, maybe Cincinnati's of a few hundred thousand. And on top of that, there are a lot of them. They account for 60% of GDP. You don't see it that people travel to the big cities. They're less visible, but they have, they really have a problem where they've been building like crazy and are sort of getting to the end of the line of that development strategy, and it's not that easy for them to pivot. So what then happens when we do see China coming out of zero COVID, at the same time that the rest of the globe is slowing down or even entering recession? I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe? Oh, China's been enormously important for the rest of the globe. It's counted for, I don't know, like a quarter of all global growth over the decade before the pandemic may be going into the first year, at least according to the IMF. And those days are over. I think we're looking at much slower growth in China, who knows what the real numbers are, that much slower growth in China for years to come. And of course, it matters. I mean, it hits commodity exporters, the hardest that they have a raracious appetite for commodities, but European luxury car makers, etc. I think it's going to have a very big effect. And that's even without the Ukraine war and whatever happens there, and which side China ends up on. Ken Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University. Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations. It's all of it, great conversation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,36,2022-10-07 16:24:34
2820," And I'm ex at Harvard University. Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations. It's all of it. Great conversation. Twitter shares continue to trade below Elon Musk's $54.20 offer price as there's still fears on a deal getting done. Let's get more on this with cities senior analyst Ron Josie. Ron, good to see you here. Just based on your knowledge of the situation folks you have talked to, do you still think this deal gets done at that price? You know, we were pretty, the big news this week was around coming together both parties suggesting with Elon saying we will on our original $54.20 share offer and Twitter come out, coming out specifically and saying that it's something that we are looking to do as well. So the fact that they're both negotiating cable not in court going against each other, I think that's a positive step. And it seems to me it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be made to Twitter and when that would actually take place even if and as this does kind of continue to work its way through? Yeah, I mean if something were to happen, meaning that if it is acquired by Mr. Musk and if we go through and it's a now private company, look, unfortunately this has been in the public world now that this acquisition back in force since called it March April I believe with the initial deal initial offer there. And so Twitter has gone through quite a bit of change from then until now, not only from a business perspective with advertisers potentially pulling back maybe getting a little bit more nervous, some placing ads on Twitter in addition to the macro changes that are happening out there, but then internally there's just a lot of concern in our view around morale, around basically attrition or just getting things done in new products being launched. So your question of how long would it take to sort of get the business back up to speed? Frankly, it would take probably some time to rebuild and the macro environment doesn't what would not help in the current environment where advertising continues to be a little bit of a softer subject overall. And Ron, we don't even know what he's going to do with the company, right? I have to say, man, it must be tough analyzing this company right now. You didn't know if the deal was going to get done. You don't know what Elon's going to do if he does indeed consummate the deal, right? I mean, we've gotten some hints dropped. There's been a lot of speculation. Trump's going to come back. He's talked about this, everything app X, whatever. But like, how do you, how do you even model concretely in a situation like this? Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company. So you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,37,2022-10-07 16:28:41
2821," Creeply in a situation like this. Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company. So you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself, to model and figure out what's next. But you essentially have to rebuild the business, right? So you start, I'm sure the first my order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the service onboarding with something that was a big focus prior to this saga that we're incurrently. And so number one would be product. Number two then is figuring out how you best monetize. And right now the model is primarily advertising. But of course, there's options around subscription, there's options around maybe payments or something along those lines purchases. So there's different things you can do. But I think day one, whenever this comes to a conclusion, has to be let's focus on the product. Let's make sure it becomes that, call it town square, open free marketplace and then everything else should follow. But it's not something that I think happens overnight. It's likely to take some time. Ron, is there an appetite in the marketplace for this super app concept that Elon is pushing here? Do consumers want to, let's say, go onto Twitter, tweet then also maybe get taken to trade some stocks on XYZ platform and then order an Uber and then a hamburger for dinner. I mean, do people really want that? Yeah, it's interesting. The super apps here in the West haven't really taken on as much as they have, taken off as much as they have over in Asia and other parts of the world. And so that definitely is a TBD overall. Partnerships to allow things along those lines that would build off of what you see on Twitter make sense. You can see that happening. But one super app, it's a change in use case, right? And the thing with Twitter that having covered the company for a while now and looking at it quarter in, quarter out, the number one thing is a product, be those monetizable daily active users. And so the more you can do to get those users on board, everybody knows Twitter. What's always surprising is you would think it would have a bigger footprint overall. And so that's the, in terms of users. And so that's probably the job number one. And if the super app does that, that's a big question. But frankly, it's still too early to even offer that. And I think you're right. It would have to be something that would at least be in line to what you are looking for and consuming while on Twitter. And there's partnerships that can make that happen. But it's definitely, I would say, the product is, that's on the roadmap for down the road once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes a media company? And I mean, a media company with partnerships that can actually charge people for the ability to watch video content, whether that be from the WMBA, whether that be live sports or the partnerships with even some of the entertainment companies that they've worked with over the past, creating kind of a charging premise based on that, where the social connectivity just becomes an extra add-on on top of that. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do with the platform when you have as many monetized or DAUs that are out there. I would say, and we've always talked about the content on Twitter is amongst the best out there. And the content is really just an amalgamation of what people are saying and doing and tweeting and whatnot. And you can get lost in Twitter for hours, the challenges that product providing those details on what you're looking for. Going more on a media strategy, working with providers and partners, we've seen success in that, right? And I think Twitter in the past has had partnerships by providing videos and highlights from the Olympics, from the NFL, from many different sports teams, as well as award shows and whatnot. So I think going down the media path is something that would continue. The question is, the model changes from primarily advertising to maybe some sort of subscription that that's a TBD. And I would say most entertainment companies on the web that have gone to paying for content, it's not an easy sort of chasm or bridge to cross. And so you really need to provide that value to get users to subscribe to it. And right now, again, Twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,38,2022-10-07 16:33:17
2822, users to subscribe to it and right now again twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level and that's really the key thing going forward the personalization well run uh... unfortunately i think this is the first time we've talked to you about twitter unfortunately maybe it'll be the last of the still goes through although perhaps it'll be a relief for you i don't know what will find some other good stocks to talk about with you though thanks so much for coming on city senior analyst run jozy appreciate it thanks rally me uh... uh... we're going to pay the from legal battles in financial wrangling to a bigger picture take on elan must potential takeover tesla cio is labeled himself a sp be a free speech absolutist and well herited heralded by some it is still fears from civil rights organizations in equal measure now from twitter as a business to the flow of information were joined by synan aral m it slow in school of management professor an author of the height machine synan always great to see you here so what's your take on the situation and it's meaning for the future of twitter great to see you thank you for having me you know i predicted that this is exactly what would happen that this deal would go uh... i actually predicted it would go through it a slightly lower price is the market uh... choosing that price for me at the fifty dollar range uh... there could be some negotiations about a slight price decrease in order to get assurances on the twitter side from us in the financiers more uh... tight language about how they could or couldn't uh... be required to go through with the deal but we'll see whether the prediction bears out exactly obviously when the investors came in it was a different climate now there's higher interest rates as inflation there's a lot of uncertainty to the uh... you crane war uh... just this week oil prices opac and russia uh... constraining supply so it's a much different environment to finance debt the banks could try to back out and could uh... trigger this escape hatch for a billion dollars uh... by elan musk but there could be some negotiations and twitter could say we want assurances and will negotiate something to get those assurances because remember for the twitter board this was a no-brainer at fifty four dollars this was a great deal for them and they'll want this deal to go through assuming the deal goes through first thing you're going to see is a mass exodus uh... due to firings and people quitting uh... people who are currently at twitter inside information says that they do not want to work for elan musk new twitter organization mostly many of them would leave on their own volition to uh... elan musk is indicated that much of the twitter leadership he does not approve of their decision-making so he,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,39,2022-10-07 16:37:16
2823," most of them would leave on their own volition. Elon Musk has indicated that much of the Twitter leadership he does not approve of their decision making so he might get rid of some people. So the compensation negotiation I think is less important because you're going to see a wholesale clean out and a wholesale change in the approach. You're going to see Donald Trump return to the platform almost immediately. You're going to see moderation rules relaxed towards this more free speech environment, although you can't get rid of moderation entirely. You're going to see attempts at the subscription model. Be more forthcoming in the short term. A lot more bot detection and bot removal as well. That's in the short term. And I think we should also talk a little bit about the long term. Expect Web three strategies to enter Elon Musk vocabulary. Will there be a Twitter coin? Will that be related to the subscription model? How will that be financing the business going forward? I think Elon Musk has made clear that he thinks that an advertising alone business model cannot save this company. There are a lot of people that agree with this opinion. I think that Twitter has struggled to succeed with an advertising only business model. Twitter blue as a subscription model was kind of a, you know, toes dangling in the water attempt to see how it would go. You can expect much more heavy commitment towards paying subscribers for premium services and or for institutional accounts to be part of the strategy of an Elon Musk Twitter. In addition, I think that you can imagine that there will be other types of subscription models. For example, selling access to particular types of institutions in terms of information that is packaged up as information services for institutions, whether it be for prediction purposes or for other types of purposes. Given that it will be a private company, there will be a lot less oversight from the public sphere over what's going on. And you can also imagine an attempt to be more inclusive of conservative voices, which would try to get at the user numbers that have been steady, but not really increasing at the rates that Elon Musk would like to see. I've got to leave it there. Sin and Al Raul, but I really appreciate you stopping by and all of those insights as always. Thank you. You have a good time. Let's stick with housing here and take a look at what's happening in the rental market because inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty are hitting that market pretty hard and your report from real damage. You found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first a three-q drop that we've seen in 30.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,40,2022-10-07 16:41:20
2824," I'm a uncertainty are hitting that market pretty hard. A new report from real page, you found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first three key drop that we've seen in 30 years. We want to bring in Jake Parsons, head of the economics industry principles at real page. Jay, it's great to see you. So very unusual for us to see a drop here in the third quarter, which is typically very strong, a three-month time frame for the rental market. What do you think is behind this massive drop that we saw? Yeah, so I think the first thing everyone's looking for is signs of affordability concerns, given the number of, given the rate, the rent increases that occurred of the last couple of years. But that's just not showing up. Wages are still up. Rent collection is still very high. In fact, they're actually up year over year. And we're not seeing any kind of move down into cheaper units and cheaper areas. And so really what appears to be happening is a freeze in household formation, because there's very little leasing traffic right now. And obviously we know people aren't buying houses right now. So it tells me that people are kind of in a wait and see mode. And they've really pushed the pause button on their housing search for the time being. The pause button. Is that how you describe the entire housing sector at the moment? And is that because of mortgage rates? It seems like buyers and sellers have back to your word paused. Yeah, no, I think, you know, obviously for renters, it's not necessarily mortgage rates directly, but it's those same kind of underlying factors that are driving up mortgage rates. That's really inflation. You know, you know, we've been talking a lot about home prices and rent, but you know, one thing everyone feels every day is groceries. I mean, they're up 13% year over year. And so I think with overall inflation, we're seeing consumer confidence is way down. And you think about it, you know, when you don't feel certain about the economy and your place in it, your financial situation, human nature is to wait it out, wait and see. And so, you know, thankfully, as you know, the job market remains strong for the time being on employment slow. And so that tells me that there's a lot of pent up demand being built up right now. So if the job market remains strong, I do think demand will come back, but it's certainly not happening right now. Jay, how long until you think that demand does return to the rental market? Yeah, good question. So these next few months, you know, winners slow period for housing of all types. You know, you don't see a lot of people moving around in the winter months. And so we really won't know much until early spring. So I think it's time we get to out March. We should see that demand come back. Now, of course, if the job market turns, it could be a very different story. But at this point, I would expect to see a lot of that, particularly for rentals. I think we'll see rental demand come back first around that timeframe. What's the inventory story in the rental market? So we saw a huge drop off in vacancies in 2021, record apartment demand, record sink of rental demand. We peaked on occupancy rates in March. It has gotten a little better for renters out there. There's a little more availability. It's still low. While there was weak apartment demand in Q3, it's still a very tight market. We have very low vacancy right now. We have high retention rates. But it's gotten a little bit better. And I think the good news for renters as well is we're going to see a lot of new inventory next year. We're seeing 40 year highs in apartment construction. We're seeing a large number of single-family rental communities, built-in communities are being built. We've even heard of home sellers. We're now choosing to run out of their homes with a way out the mortgage market. And so there's definitely more inventory. And I think we'll see more next year as well. Jay, what does this do to prices? I guess that there's more inventory, more options on the table. Are we going to go and you see a pretty big drop then in rentals? I don't think we're going to see an industry drop in rents for most parts of the country. I think we could see some seasonal cuts here in the winter months, but nothing dramatic and drastic. But I think we can see more importantly, though, I think we're going to see a big moderation in rent growth next year. And to be honest, we've already seen that. I mean, the certainly the CPI does not reflect this. And most of the big rent hikes occurred in 2021. And in 2022, we've really seen more moderate rent increases. And I think we're going to see more of them return to normal in terms of rent growth next year. All right, Jay Parsons. Great to get your take. Thanks so much for joining us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,41,2022-10-07 16:46:23
2825," you you you Well inflation doesn't seem to be worrying car collectors bring a trailer a classic car our collector marketplace has already surpassed $1 billion in sales this year. We're joining us now to now is bring a trailer CEO, Randy Nunnberg, and our senior auto supporter prize to Romanian, joining the fund as well. Good to see you, Randy. So this is actually coming off the back of two bumper years already. What do you attribute this year's growth to? This year we've just seen people continue to be very interested in the space. And frankly, our audience has expanded into people that might never have thought about buying a collectible vehicle or a sort of hobby vehicle. And we've really expanded the audience and given people more confidence to buy online. Hey, Randy, pros here. So I kind of feel like there's two markets going on. We have the high end Pebble Beach Market that's sort of blowing away our cumulative scale sales every year. And then we have the kind of smaller niche stuff that you guys also operate in, the enthusiast modern classics. What do you think is happening in that second market? Is that second market as strong as that premier kind of high end classic car market? Yeah, when we invented and bring a trailer, a lot of people thought it would be for old-fashioned type cars. But it quickly became apparent that the model of transparency and reliability online and being able to sell a car at a very efficient fee and reliable way was interesting for modern cars. Like the ones you see on your screen right now, modern BMWs, forces, this sort of thing. People are using green trailer to buy their daily driver vehicle. And particularly in the last six months or a year with limited availability at new car dealerships and some dynamics in play like that, a lot of people look to our platform to go buy their car that they were going to drive every single day. And so that has really expanded our marketplace. Now, Rochelle mentioned you guys cross that billion dollar sale volume mark already in 2022, blowing away what you guys did last year in 2021. Now, we're kind of seeing the economy get a little bit kind of weaker here. The stock market is a bit uncertain at this point. Are you guys seeing any kind of hesitancy on your buyers and your site for now for these types of modern classics? We haven't seen a slowdown in terms of submissions for cars to be sold. It's actually up substantially over last year. The interesting part of being a marketplace is whether it's an up market or a down market, people are going to look for, again, that's sort of most efficient and reliable way to unload something if they have a special car that they paid for a year ago or a year and a half ago and now things tighten up and they say, oh, maybe I'm going to unload. I really think that we're kind of poised to be the place where they will do that. So obviously everybody loves the boom years when everybody's spending like crazy and buying rapidly. But as people decide to look for places to sell, it's actually an interesting position wherein as I think we'll see quite a bit of demand for the site's services, even if there is a plateau or a slowdown. And so Randy, obviously a lot of people think their car was worth the fortune. How do you manage expectations in this sort of environment, whether it's from what sellers can expect to get or even a oak here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,42,2022-10-07 16:50:26
2826," Slow down. And so, Randy, obviously a lot of people think their car was worth the fortune. How do you manage expectations in this sort of environment, whether it's from what sellers can expect to get, or even the fees that sellers and buyers can expect to pay? Yeah, well, we really just lean on that transparency, and that's what's really different. The internet was a scary place for people for a long time to try to sell a car who was going to buy it or who was going to show up at your house or how is that going to work. And our sort of community dynamic that we built for listing vehicles online really changed that. Brand new cars are sort of a commodity, but the older ones like you're seeing here, and even special interest things from five and ten years ago, you really like to have a community and sort of a cast of experts that can discuss it. And so that has really given people that confidence that they needed. And so I think we'll see that being a really attractive model going forward. And like I said, whether it's, you know, boom years or not, it's a compelling marketplace and we see increased demand that's not letting up even in this environment. You know, Randy, one of the areas you guys were focused on is in 90s recently. This era is sort of seeing a little uptick. What's behind that, do you think? Is it just sort of an nostalgia for Gen X and things like that? Yeah, I mean, when I was a kid, you know, classic cars were from the 50s and 60s and had tail fins and chrome. These days, cars from the 80s and 90s are 25 and 30 years old, just like they were back in the day. But that's sort of the era of when people like me were in high school or were kids and the kind of stuff we were looking at. Those have come into their own and it's actually the highest volume of submissions and listings we have on, bring a trailer from the 90s and 2000s, 2010. And most people never guess that in our sort of surprise when I mentioned that a collectible and special interest car marketplace focuses on those sort of eras. But that's by far the highest dollar volume. A lot of the record results that we're seeing are in that sort of area and it's different than people would have predicted. And Randy, we were looking at some images there. The 1962 Jaguar XK-E Series One Road, so that was on your site. If I had an extra $200,000 this May, I would have tried to bid on it. Is there a unicorn car out there that you would like to get your hands on? And what sort of price range are you talking? Good question. I mean, our site serves all sorts of price ranges. Yeah, that one may have been 200,000, but I tend to tell my friends, I tend to dream about 20 or 25,000 out of time. There's a lot of different opportunities out there. My favorite cars that we're still just now seeing trickle onto the website are kind of the racing cars of my youth. Again, it says 80s and 90s type cars, the ones that had the sponsor liverys. They had some famous folks like Tom Cruise and Paul Newman driving them, that sort of stuff. That stuff gets me really fired up. But we have 130 employees and all of them have their different dreams and favorite sectors. And that's part of what makes the bring a trailer community super interesting is the variety and the different types of cars. So it's really all over the map. Hey, Randy, you guys are approaching the 100,000 auction listing mark, I believe, coming up soon. What does that mean for you and the team? You guys have built their bring a trailer? Well, it's going to be a celebration. First of all, you may have been there in the early days, but when we turned on bring a trailer auctions in 2014, we did three cars. We did three cars a week for the first little watt. So talking three plus three plus three. And then now you're talking 100,000. It's just a crazy journey that we've been on. Obviously, there's been a lot of operationalizing the business to be able to do that. Like I said, with such a staff, we are still a human centered product. So when you list a car and bring a trailer, you get a person to walk you through that and you get to talk to them through the process. So it's not just an automated website. So to get to 100,000 and still offer that human level of service is really challenging. So we are we are celebrating. I think we're about to cross 88,000 or 89,000 listings this week. And so we're a couple of months out from that big milestone. And at least we'll throw a good party. But we'll hopefully be able to engage the whole Bringer Trader community as well. Well, congratulations on that upcoming landmark. Bring a trailer's Randy Nonenberg and our very own prize to Romanian. Thank you very much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,43,2022-10-07 16:54:57
2827," you you and The housing market is struggling, but that's not the case for the home furniture industry. The venture-funded parachute launching its line of living room furniture today, you're to tell us about it, is parachute CEO Areal. Okay? Are you all nice to see up until the Fed pauses the housing market is essentially well-possed on bullfins? How is that impacting your business? You know, we see the home ships and consumers spend, you know, definitely impacting, but what we're seeing with our customer base, which is millennials and millennial shoppers, there are 70 million millennial shoppers that are moving into their prime earning years. They are in the midst of household formation and they are still looking to shop for home and will continue to be shopping and really spending a lot of time in their in their spaces. Are you all right? Have you seen any sort of shift just in terms of consumer spending or how much people are spending or what they're willing to spend on? Yeah, I mean, we're seeing the impact of inflation and we've been certainly impacted by that as well, but you know, we have seen the business continue to grow year over year and we expect to have a good holiday season as people are preparing to host and really spend more time at home. And Areal, with that tightening economy, yet still you're on track to essentially double your store count in a 12 month period. How are you really bucking the national trend? You know, we see our customers really wanting to buy beautiful products and beautiful spaces. We have 21 stores open today. That's up from 12 at the beginning of this year. So we have nearly doubled and we'll have 25 by the end of the year. We just we see it as a relationship build. We see an impact on our econ business when we open a store and a given market and we see those customers wanting to spend more. It's also been a really important part of our growing trade business working with interior designers. That's a very localized business. People like to come in. They like to touch and fill the products and bring their clients in. So, you know, we feel really bullish to on retail. Our stores are small. They're intimate. They have pretty low operating costs. And so we're able to really build that part of our business profitably. Supply chain issues has certainly been a challenge here for a number of larger players within your space. You're expanding at a time when so many other companies just can't keep up with the demand that they have had. How are you doing this? And I guess how are you not feeling some of those challenges? So we've been really fortunate. Most of our products are made in Europe or the US and everything is shipped into New Jersey where we have our centralized distribution center. So we have been able to avoid a lot of the congestion and various ports on the west coast as well as delays and disruption in Asia. It's, you know, we've been really lucky that we've been able to work closely with our manufacturers. We have a really strong technology platform that allows us to gauge demand and really be thoughtful on how we are ordering and working alongside our our manufacturers who have become partners over the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,44,2022-10-07 16:58:53
2828," that allows us to gauge demand and really be thoughtful on how we are ordering and working alongside our our manufacturers who have become partners over the past eight and a half years. And you mentioned millennials earlier more than 70% of your customer base. Why is that age group in particular drawn to the brand? And just to give people a sense of it, trying to figure out your price point in comparison to say Cracken Bay, Barrel or Restoration Hardware. So you're doing a nice job of showing the showroom. For example, how much is that lovely chair you're sitting in? This chair is $1,700. This chair came out today. It has a beautiful swivel and is available in a number of different fabrics. So we look at costing across the competitor as we try to make sure that we're priced with a value centered, really proposition. Our products are premium. They're super high quality. We design them all in-house, which is definitely a differentiator for the brand. But really, the customer segment that we're going after millennials are really shopping with their values. We are known as the most sustainable brand in the space. And we really speak to the customer in a new way. These are folks that shop online. They want to be inspired. And we do that through our social channels. And we've really re-imagined the way that these products are merchandise and manufactured. You can see behind our store looks like a home. It's really quite beautiful and a very different experience than when you go into a much larger shopping experience. Ariel, another thing that you're doing to expand that customer base. You've had a couple of collaborations, one of those being with Nordstrom, they are among your partnerships. I guess what is this done for your business? And are there more of those types of partnerships in the pipeline? Yeah, we love our partnership in Nordstrom. We are at a number of their stores. And we really see this as an awareness play. They have such a strong and loyal customer base. And we really want to tap into that customer and really bring our products to life. When we leverage partnerships like that, we typically do an exclusive colorway or an exclusive product to really make it feel special and really give purpose to that partnership. But we're in the early months of that partnership and we're excited to see that partnership continue to grow in the coming year. Ariel, OK. We wish you all the best. Thank you so much, Robynon, and joining us today. In this episode of influencers, Hermitage Capital Management CEO, Bill Browder. Are we ready to go to war? Is the United States ready to go to war with Russia? I think that this is going to lead to a Russian depression. I can't imagine the strangle how the stranglehold doesn't really drive the GDP down, like 20%, 25%. It's remarkable. And we're just in the early stages of this game. The Ukrainians are not going to roll over it. They're going to fight like hell. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirwer. And welcome to our guest, Bill Browder, CEO at Hermitage Capital and Head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Browder's firm delivered stellar returns by exposing corruption at major Russian companies, bringing about company shakeups and boosting share prices. In 2005, Browder was denied reentry to Russia and later became a victim of a Russian government scheme to undermine his firm, he says. Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer hired Browder to investigate Russian corruption was arrested and died in Russian custody. Bill, welcome to influencers. Thank you so much for joining us. Great to be here. So much to get to right now. I want to ask you maybe, first of all, about Vladimir Putin. And have you ever seen Putin reverse course in 25 years of Washington closely? Can you see him changing his tack now and Ukraine now that he's committed to a full-scale invasion? That's really the most...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,45,2022-10-07 17:03:26
2829," Can you see him changing his tack now and Ukraine? Now that he's committed to a full scale invasion. That's the most important question of our discussion. And the answer is definitive no. Vladimir Putin can't. You have to imagine his world is the world of a prison yard. In a prison yard, you can't show any weakness. If someone comes at you with a shank, you got to shank them 10 times more and look around at everyone else and say, who else wants to be shanked? That's that's Vladimir Putin's mindset. That's how he operates. And so when he hasn't barked on this on this horrific military invasion, it's there's no chance that any time he announces peace talks, that's just a tactic to either split up the resolve of the West or to delay some action to resupply or something like that. And so he is going to move forward. He's going to escalate. There's no retreat. There's no compromise. There's no diplomacy. He's all in it for for victory. However, he defines that. And so a lot of people use this phrase end game build, but I'll ask you. I mean, what is the end game here specifically with Ukraine first? And does he want to occupy it or how does work in his mind? Well, this is really another important part of Vladimir Putin. There is no end game. So what you have to understand is he is not there for all the reasons that he says he's there. You can't believe a word he says. He's an inveterate liar. His credibility is zero. And so any words that he has used to describe what he's doing should be discounted. The reason that he is a Ukraine is because after 22 years as a dictator, he sees the writing on the wall. He sees the writing on the wall, meaning that the bellorussian dictator next door was almost overthrown 18 months ago by his people. The Kazakh dictator again, and next door in a different direction was overthrown. And Putin realized that it was just a matter of time before the Russians overthrew him. And so pulling straight out of the dictator's playbook 101, he said, what do you do to not get overthrown? You start a war. And he's described Ukrainians as Nazis and drug dealers. And he's described NATO as an invading force and all sorts of things. He doesn't believe any of that. He's just trying to come up with a narrative to give the Russian people something to chew on in order for him to have a war and his war is there to stay in power. And so when you say, what is his endgame, there is no endgame. His endgame is to move forward, to expand, to attack, to take territory, to declare victories. But he has to keep on going no matter what it is. And this is just part of that process. And it's not like it just started now. I mean, the most recent version of this just started now. He was feeling under pressure in 2008. And that's when he invaded Georgia in 2014, the same thing. He took Crimea. And so this is a long process of him trying to stay in power as a dictator. And the most scary part of this whole story is that I don't have any belief that he will stop. So let's just say that he's successful in Ukraine. And that's a very big question because the Ukrainians are valuably fighting back. But let's say he was successful in Ukraine. That's not the end of his story. He would then go to other countries. Maybe the easy ones, maybe the hard ones, maybe grabs Moldova at some point. But his ultimate goal for him is to show up at the border with us, which means Estonia or Latvia or Lithuania or Poland. And then to test out something that has never been tested before, which is, are we ready to go to war? Is the United States ready to go to war with Russia to protect Estonia, a country of a million people that probably, you know, 2% of Americans could locate on a map. Are we ready to do that? Or are we not? And he's taken the bat. Well, we're not. But isn't this going to be very difficult for him just to hold on to this real estate? I mean, look at Afghanistan, very different country, certainly. But look at Afghanistan under Brezhnev. And now we're ready to win.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,46,2022-10-07 17:08:00

I mean, there's a huge cost of occupying these countries, right? Absolutely. So I was just saying, I was saying that's his assumption. He's just keep on pushing out. Now, let's talk about Ukraine specifically. So he's launched an invasion of Ukraine. We don't know the exact number of casualties, but I've read various reports to say that there's 3,000 soldiers have been killed in the first four days of their occupation. I don't know if that's true or not. Maybe it's wild, the exaggerate. Maybe it's totally true. But let's just say for a moment, let's just take for a moment and say it is true. That's the total number of soldiers that died in the entire war with Chechnya. That's like a third or between a quarter and a third of the total number of soldiers that died after nine and a half years in Afghanistan. And so he's paying a hefty price, even if it's just a fraction of the 3,000, he's still paying a hefty price for what he's done so far. And we're just in the early stages of this game, the Ukrainians are not going to roll over. They're going to fight like hell. Thankfully, now, after some resistance, all of the major Western allies are going to assist them with equipment to help them fight and give them some decent chance. But at the end of the day, Vladimir Putin has way outgunned them. I mean, he's got all sorts of stuff. There was, I mean, shocking military hardware that could really be unbelievably destructive and to people in Ukraine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,47,2022-10-07 17:12:26
2831," you you it appears or one could argue that the Ukrainians are winning the war of social media and I'm wondering if Vladimir Putin who supposedly was this expert in disinformation and social media has underestimated the Ukrainians abilities there. So the Ukrainians had some help and as critical as I am on some aspects of US foreign policy, the Biden administration's done a fantastic job early on of sharing intelligence about what the Russians were up to and repeating it and repeating it and repeating it. But by the time the Russians invaded, there was no alternative narrative. So the way the Russians normally do this and they did this with Georgia, for example, there was like confusion to this day about who fired first in Georgia and the Russian apologists said, well, it was a Georgians who precipitated and provoked this war and so on and so forth. There's no uncertainty about this. This was a war of aggression and that's a very important term, a war of aggression is a term they use in the Nuremberg trials. This is a war of aggression that everybody can agree on. And so there's nobody who can can know sort of natural Russian apologists, nobody who's got a lot of financial interest with Russia, who can say anything other than this is a brazen attack on a peaceful neighbor. And that's an extremely important part of the narrative that has allowed all the Western countries to lock arms and do the coordinated sanctions that are that have been done right now, which are causing enormous financial pain to Vladimir Putin. Yeah, let's drill down into that bill sanctions. How effective are they right now and what you know what grade would you give them, for instance, and what do we need to do from here. So I'm a sort of connoisseur of sanctions. It's such a thing exists. And so when they first started this sanctions program about a week ago last Tuesday, I would have given the Western governments a two out of 10. It was all very, you know, too little too late. Then the atrocities started to happen and the sanctions started getting real when they added the major Russian banks, the big oil companies, et cetera, by Thursday was an eight out of 10, then they did swift. So that's a nine out of 10, and then they did Vladimir Putin and nine and a half out of 10. So there's still some gaps that need to be filled in swift is only done. So swift means disconnecting the Russian banks from the international financial system. So it's not only done 70% of the banks. And so logic would tell you that if 70% of the banks are disconnected, they'll just route all the payments through the 30% of the banks that aren't disconnected. That's just what anyone would do. And certainly the Russians will do that. So we need to sanction the other 30% of the banks and a lot of people ask me why, why are those banks protected. And I mentioned that there was some, you know, a glee back room deal with, you know, in a smoky room or somebody said we have an interest there. Don't do that. But so those other 30% of the banks need to be sanctioned disconnected from swift. And then the most important part of the whole exercise is that Vladimir Putin's own money needs to be hit. And his own money is held not by himself, but by oligarchs who look after it. And so we need to freeze the assets of the oligarchs in the West. And a lot of announcements have been made that that's that's the intention. A few oligarchs about have been added to the various EU, US, UK sanctions lists. But that needs to be done in a much more coordinated manner. Because it did.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,48,2022-10-07 17:16:12
2832," have been added to the various EU, US, UK sanctions lists. But that needs to be done in a much more coordinated manner, because there's different oligarchs in the US that have been sanctioned in the EU and different ones in the EU than the UK. And then a list needs to be expanded dramatically. So there's 50 or 60 or 100 of the most wealthy oligarchs in Russia sanctioned. And if we get... God, let me interrupt, I'm sorry, Goa, but practically speaking, how would that be accomplished? Isn't that extremely difficult? You've got camons and countries like that. I don't mean to spare them specifically. There are all sorts of money havens around the world. Nevermind, Switzerland, which is said that actually they're up against Russia at this point. But how would that be done practically? Well, it's actually not as complicated as you think. So it's not the government's job to necessarily track down the assets. The way it works in practical terms is a person gets added to the sanctions list. Once they're on the sanctions list, then it's the job or the responsibility, not the job, but the legal responsibility of a bank that holds their money to no longer transact with that person. So that money gets frozen or a real estate agent, not to sell their property or a broker, not to sell their shares. And at that point, everything gets frozen. And so it actually gets crowdsourced. Now, you made a good point, which is, let's say their stuff is not in the United States or in the UK, but in the Cayman Islands. Well, guess what? The Cayman Islands is a crown dependency. And as a result, every one of these Gernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, they copy the British sanctions list. And so you end up in a situation where whatever Britain does, all these offshore jurisdictions do. And so Britain is really punching way above its weight in terms of its importance in this whole scheme. And so just coming back to the original thought, you put a person on the sanctions list, they get sanctioned everywhere. Cayman Islands, BBI, UK, and if all the countries coordinate, then there's really no civilized place they can hide. Now, we're seeing oligarchs scrambling right now, moving yachts. I read a story about one oligarch who's parked his yacht in Saudi Arabia, as he doesn't think that the Saudi Arabians will freeze his yacht. And there are stories about mad scrambles of oligarchs trying to sell properties, give them away to family members and getting divorced from their wives, giving them property, all sorts of interesting stuff. And that will happen. And they will probably succeed in protecting some of their assets. But even if you don't get all their assets, just having a person on the sanctions list means that they're no longer, that they're pretty much out of the game. They're benched in the world, in the international financial world. Another remarkable development, or correct me if you think I'm wrong, Bill, is the response by the private sector, both in Europe and in the United States. I mean, everything from business to the shell, to the banks, curtailing or ending their financial relationships with Russia. What do you think about that, and is this effective? Well, in a certain way, I would almost argue it's more effective, because, okay, so the sanctions lists are important, government activity is important. But if every Western company stops doing business with the Russians, it's really dramatic. I remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for Sergey Magnitsky, my murdered lawyer, one of the first people I met with, I was in South Africa, and I met with a woman named Helen Zilli, who was one of the people involved in the, one of the main people involved in the anti-apartheid movement. I'd watched a movie called Cry Freedom, and she was one of the characters in the movie. And I met with her shortly after her sort of game, I guess, who was murdered, and we talked, and we talked about how they ended apartheid. And she said, it was all about disinvestment. It was all about the US and Western Europe disinvesting from South Africa, that when they became financially isolated, that's when it became too much. And so I think this is really, really important. And I think this is probably, as I look at the next steps, what can we do next when we watch these atrocities unfold in Ukraine? I think it's just to pressure every single Western business to divest, to stop doing business, to stop supplying goods, to stop supplying services to Russia. Right. Are the sanctions enough to send the Russian economy into a recession?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,49,2022-10-07 17:20:57
2833," to stop doing business, to stop supplying goods, to stop supplying services to Russia. Right. Are the sanctions enough to send the Russian economy into recession? And is this an objective that we should try to achieve, even? Well, if you had asked me two months before this whole thing had started, I would have said, let's just go after the oligarchs and leave the Russian people alone. We have got no beef with the Russian people. They didn't do anything. They don't, the most Russian people don't want this. I would say the vast majority don't want this. They don't want to send soldiers into harm's way to be killed and mangled. They don't want to have to pay 100% more for food and imports, which they're not even going to get anymore. No more imports. I think the average Russian person doesn't want this. And so I wish that we had done this before, which, and possibly, you know, sent Putin a message, how costly this would be in a real way that he went to understand it. So he wouldn't have invaded. But we, he has invaded. And so now we have to say, okay, what's the strategy going forward? And the strategy has to be to raise the price as high as possible. And most importantly, to just deplete Vladimir Putin of resources so that this war becomes so expensive and he just doesn't have the money because the central bank reserves are frozen, the exports are not generating any income, no more foreign direct investment at all. And so we're in a situation where he just can't afford it anymore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,50,2022-10-07 17:25:54
2834," you You person it about sure talked about a little bit with your firm and all of your trials and tribulations in Russian investing there. After your ordeal battling the government in Russia, you became a global champion of the Magnitsky Act, which allows the U.S. and other countries to sanction foreign officials involved in human rights abuses, validating or infuriating to see the need for such laws at a time like this. Both, but most interestingly, so we, the Magnitsky Act works for human rights abusers and corrupt officials. It was passed in 2012 and it completely blew, Putin blew his top when he saw this happen. And I mean, really just like, I mean, in the most emotional way, he banned the adoption of Russian orphans by American families and retaliation. The orphans that were being adopted were the sick ones, the ones who were not well. And Americans would still take these children back to America and nursing to health and they attended to die in the orphanages. So he's effectively sentencing orphans to death in his own country as a retaliation against the Magnitsky Act. And everybody was scratching their heads and saying, why is this guy reacting so harshly? And the reason is we can see it today, literally today, which is that this was the basis for which all of future sanctions were modeled on asset freezes and travel bands. And every, every person that's now going to be sanctioned will basically be sanctioned on the basis of the Magnitsky Act. And the reason he was so upset was because he knew he's not stupid. He knew that eventually the Magnitsky Act would come for his money. And so there's a direct line between the murder of Sergey Magnitsky, my campaign for the Magnitsky Act, the sanctions that were put in place and the sanctions that are now going to go after Putin's money. In 2018, Putin mentioned you by name during a press conference with then President Trump offering to allow US investigators to interview 12 Russian intelligence agents identified by Robert Mueller's probe in exchange for allowing Russian intelligence to question you and others close to you. Trump, let her call it an incredible offer. What is your view of the way Trump reset US relations with Russia? And do you think it affects the way the world approaches Russia today? Well, thankfully, I think that the Trump situation was an aberration. I don't think it was like a permanent damage to the relations between the United States and the rest of the world. And I don't think it certainly hurt the US credibility for a short period of time. But we can see right now in the multilateral approach towards sanctioning Russia that things continue to work as they should. I mean, it's pretty horrifying the idea that an American president would hand over me and a bunch of US government officials to Putin because Putin asked for that. I mean, it's just unbelievable, really. And it also seems pretty unbelievable. It took him four days to walk it back. And it was only after the Senate planned had a vote together and not to hand us over. And they voted 98 to zero about 20 minutes before the vote Trump through his press secretary declined Putin's offer. But if Trump had been reelected, so that was during the Mueller probe. So if, and so he was sort of under the spotlight as far as Russia goes, if he was reelected, I wouldn't have been able to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,51,2022-10-07 17:29:16
2835," So that was during the Mueller probe. So if, and so he was sort of under the spotlight as far as Russia goes, if he was reelected, I wouldn't have been able to travel back to the United States because surely he would have handed me over to Putin. And so I, from a personal safety standpoint, I breathed an enormous sigh of relief when he was defeated. And final question, going forward, what sort of work do you see yourself doing and what sort of legacy do you see yourself leaving? Well, the legacy that I've, I'm in the process of leaving is a legacy where Sergei Magnitsky's name is on legislation, not just in the United States, but now in 34 countries, sanctioning human rights abusers, not just in Russia, but all over the world. And so the Magnitsky Act now applies to Chinese officials involved in the genocide in Jingjiang is involved in sanctions, Iranians, Myanmar officials, all sorts of bad actors all over the world. And it creates a big disincentive to human rights abusers and to kleptocrats. And it also creates some redress for victims. And for me, the Sergei Magnitsky's murder is a burden, a burden of guilt that I carry with me everywhere because he was my responsibility and he was killed in my service. And so every day that I do something to enhance his legacy and to do that in a way that potentially will offer other victims redress and save lives is sort of my project. And as more and more countries do this, then the next step is to have more and more countries use the Magnitsky Act against bad actors. And so Sergei Magnitsky will from the grave and from heaven be helping everybody else out in their terrible moments of distress.

If you've been watching influencers, I'm Andy Cerwer. We'll see you next time. Music Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live, everyone. We've reached this the top of the 10 AM hour Brad Smith here in studio with Julie Hyman, Brian Sazi on assignment, as we'll say from home today. Happy Friday to you all here on this jobs Friday. Let's take a look at where the market sand following that jobs report earlier, which was just a little bit hotter than expectations. We're taking a look at the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 all lower on the day. The Dow is lower by a little more than 480 points to the downside of about 1.6%. The S&P 500, they're also seeing that deep in the red right now by roughly 2% that looks like it. And then additionally, the Nasdaq composite, you're seeing that down by about 312 points and taking a deeper dive into that jobs report. Of course, later on in this show, we're going to have set criteria of labor, Marty Walsh going to join us momentarily to get reaction from the White House. So stay tuned for that conversation. Plus, it's jeans Friday, wherever you find yourself in the world. But Levi's under pressure this morning after the denim maker cut its outlook. We're going to speak to the companies CFO to discuss its latest earnings report as you get ready to put the jorts away. And an unprecedented move in the movie world, Netflix is set to show the knives out sequel in major theaters one month before it's streaming release. We're going to discuss what that means for the streaming space, all of that much more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,52,2022-10-07 17:34:06
2836," to show the knives, out sequel and major theaters one month before it's streaming release. We're going to discuss what that means for the streaming space. All of that much more coming up during this 10 a.m. hour. But for much more on today's markets, let's get on over to Yahoo Finance and Nez Faray as we're about 30 minutes into today's trading session and Nez on Over To You. And Brad, you mentioned the losses after that jobs report and we are still seeing the S&P 500 down 2%. But if we just pull up a five day chart because of Monday and Tuesday's rally, we are set to end the week in the green for the major averages because of those days. If we stay at this space, let's see what happens throughout the day. Looking also at the 10 year treasury note, that's higher up 7 basis points at 3.9%. We saw that 10 year treasury yield go higher after that jobs report. Also the US dollar index that moved higher after the jobs report as well. Want to point out what's happening with Bitcoin because we did see Bitcoin moving to the downside earlier. And then looking at the sector action, we're watching the high growth names that are really under pressure. So you're watching tech consumer discretionary materials are leading to the downside over on the NASDAQ 100. The mega caps, as I mentioned, Tesla down 3% Amazon also lower in video down 5% and the semiconductors are really seeing some pressure today after that revenue warning from AMD. Finally, I want to mention what's happening with the home builders because of higher interest rates and what this how this affects the home builders. Well, you're looking at them in the red right now, especially home builders and also companies that have to do with market risk. Yeah, definitely anything interest rate sensitive is is in focus here today. Thanks so much, you know, as well as continue our conversation on the job report and the market implications joining us now. John Tobin, epic investment partners managing director and senior equity research analyst. John, it's good to see you. So as we look at this good news is bad news kind of jobs day. I mean, is that just very simply how we should look at it here that the Fed is going to be raising rates for the foreseeable future? I think that's right. I think, you know, the market it seems in certainly the past few days we've seen evidence of it. It's looking for some reason, something to latch on to to justify a rally. They're hoping for some evidence that the Fed's about to pivot the Reserve Bank of Australia's move early in the week ignited that hope. And even though the Fed speakers all week long pushed back on that pretty hard, I think the evidence today is from the job report job the job's market still remains strong and the Fed still has work to do. Now, as we've talked about it in our shop this morning on our morning call, there is clearly evidence of deceleration here. So if you're trying to find some good news here, the numbers are moving in the right direction. This is a 263K increase in jobs, but it shows continual deceleration over time. Average hourly earnings are up, but again, evidence of deceleration. So I think the main takeaway is things are moving in the right direction, but the Fed still has a lot of work to do. Rates are still going higher. So, John, should the other takeaway here, just looking at the market action in the early going is for investors to fade any rallies? Well, I think that's, I mean, that would be my personal view that with each attempt to rally into this, I've continued to make the case that I don't see what the foundation is for a strong rally, for a sustainable rally. I mean, if you think about what the drivers of equity market returns are, it's earnings growth, it's dividends, and it's multiple expansion. And if rates are going higher, that's a headwind for multiple expansion. And if the economy is slowing down and maybe headed for a recession, that's a headwind for earnings growth. So, the main underpinnings that would support a sustainable rally just aren't there. I think to me, this is a market environment where investors need to keep some defensive exposure in their asset allocation. We've had a conversation, especially around the shift in the types of jobs, the employment situation really lays out, kind of sector by sector here. But for some of those businesses that are looking at the amount of people that post pandemic, they've realized they actually need to run the business. It also becomes a question of where some of those...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,53,2022-10-07 17:38:04
2837," businesses that are looking at the amount of people that post pandemic they've realized they actually need to run the business. It also becomes a question of where some of those employees will find employment elsewhere and in different sectors as well as many people have upskilled over the course of the pandemic. I mean does that drastically shape everything from wages all the way to what a solid baseline sector by sector actually looks like? Well you're absolutely right that there are some sector trends that we're noticing here where there's strength, where there's weakness, there's strength and leisure and hospitality, there's weakness in other sectors, there's weakness in energy, there's weakness in things related to building and construction of course. But and it's disruptive for the economy as you point out that people are far looking for jobs and looking to move perhaps into new areas where there is job growth. So there is that friction but that's not really something new that's or necessarily a post-pandemic phenomenon. I think that's that's historically bend the case. There's always a friction as as people move and try to direct themselves into the areas where there's greater employment opportunities. John bottom line when it comes to these markets I think people are trying to figure out what the heck to do right now and you have some interesting stuff in your portfolio including consumer staples things like Home Depot and Walmart. Do you think that a company like Walmart for example has gotten past its inventory troubles and is still going to be able to benefit as we head towards the holiday season? So you know it's absolutely true that as the retailers have inventory issues to grapple with and I wouldn't want to say that for Walmart that it's all said and done and and they're behind it. I think our view on Walmart is more is more of a basic fundamental view that this is a business that historically is resilient in economic downturns and if we're looking at a slower economic environment and we're looking at the possibility of a recession and we think about where are we most likely to have the stocks and the companies that are most likely to hold up best in that environment. It is some of the defensive sectors, the traditional defensive sectors like staples, the Walmart's healthcare for example utilities, another area where we have exposure even but at the same time even some financials will hold up better regional banks. There'll probably be some evidence of weakening the loan demand and some pick up in credit quality issues but we think that they're at a very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure to and we think these are sectors. It won't mean that they won't feel any pressure from a slowing economy but rather that they will be more resilient in the face of a challenging market environment. Just trying to tie both inflation and employment together because one of that is an input cost into the prices that consumers are having to pay as well. For consumers and of course everybody who's in this economy and is working there's still money that is going out the door out of your pockets both on a necessity basis or on a discretionary basis so with that in mind where then are we going to expect to see kind of wages stabilized at the same time that the Fed is trying to see inflation stabilized. Well the Fed is clearly trying to get inflation down and trying to get a way to growth down and what that really means even though they don't like to say it so much out loud is they need the unemployment rate to go up and they need jobs growth to slow pretty dramatically. So but you're right this implies pressure on the consumers so there'll be pressure on the consumer in terms of weaker jobs growth. There'll be people more people unemployed. There's more pressure on consumer pocketbooks because of inflationary pressures what people are paying at the pump for gasoline what they're paying for their energy bill when they get their connet bill every month so there's pressure on the consumer. This is all part of the of the narrative of an economy that is being forced to slow down by Fed policy. John if I'm correct you have some exposures to some big cap tech names an apple Microsoft and IBM even a broadcom but in light of this AMD warning which is pretty pretty shocking I mean I missed their expectations by a billion dollars on sales are even trying to rotate out of big cap tech or you gonna just just try to just survive this this volatility. Well you know the truth is in the strategy that that I help run",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,54,2022-10-07 17:42:28
2838," rotate out of the cap tech or you're going to just try to just survive this this volatility. Well, you know, the truth is in the strategy that that I help run, tech is a significant underweight for us. We actually have a hard time finding tech names that fit the characteristics that we see. We're looking for companies that have growing cash, they attract them, growing dividends, and otherwise use cash to distribute the shareholders through share buybacks. So we do have exposure to some of those tech names that you mentioned, but we are underweight. We're underweight those names, kind of by definition, underweight Apple. Apple's over 4% of the index. So while we have Apple in the portfolio, it's an underweight apple. And while we have tech in the portfolio, it's an underweight to the tech sector. I'm sure that there's some names that we look at and will probably trim them and maybe even exit them, but there's nothing that we're thinking about doing right this minute. All right, we'll leave it there. John Tobin, Epoch, Investment Partners, Managing Director, and Profoli Manager. Good to see you. Have a good weekend. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it. Yep. All right. Before we head to break, let's pull up shares of Target, which are getting a bullish call by Goldman Sachs retail analyst Kate McShane. Shane is reiterating by rating on Target, and issuing a $205 price target. The upbeat call comes as Target is warned on sales three times since March 1st, only to the economic slowdown. It says McShane. We think despite the missteps Target has taken this year on both merchandising and diamond, it remains a retail secular winner, which should support the stock. We'll take more into Target on October 17th. When Target Chairman Seal Brian Cornell chats with me at the Yow Finance All Market Summit, definitely looking forward to that chat in that day. All right, coming up, US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, will join us to talk all things jobs report. Don't go anywhere. Welcome back. Job growth, beating estimates by 8,000 in September as high rates and elevated costs per major US economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,55,2022-10-07 17:46:44
2839," Welcome back. Job growth beating estimates by 8,000 in September as high rates and elevated costs per made the U.S. economy. But how will a stronger than expected labor report guide the Fed, all of this percolating through the markets today? Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is joining us now from Washington, D.C. Mr. Secretary, great to see you as always. And so this number showing growth today in places like labor and hospitality, I'm always curious what you're hearing in your conversations with corporate leaders around the country, where they're having still trouble, because on the other hand, we're also seeing some industries cut back. Give us a little colorist to what you're hearing. Yeah, it really depends on where we are. You know, I think one of the areas when you think about cybersecurity and the tech space, that's where a lot of companies are still growing. Some have cut back. So we talk about how do we create programs so we can get people skilled without working with community colleges in particular, working with colleges in the country, and really thinking about what employers are talking about now is not about the job market of right now, but they're talking about participation and anticipated growth in their companies and making sure they have the skill to work for us to be able to keep up with that growth. Mr. Secretary, is it a little surprising that we're still seeing some strong job growth like this in upward revisions to prior months, at the same time the Federal Reserve is really trying to slow the economy down? When you see the areas that we saw growth in this month, and we saw the hospital industry and medical growth fully recovered from pre-pandemic, you know, you're seeing that a lot of people hiring in those hospitals because there's a lot of electric elective procedures that were put off, so they're hiring more people in hospitals. We're seeing an increase in manufacturing, certainly more jobs than pre-pandemic and manufacturing, and I think a lot of that has to do with what happened during the pandemic with supply chain. We're seeing more and more companies want to create more and build more here in the United States. We're seeing the President really focusing on that as well, doing more in the United States. We're seeing in this particular drop month, we didn't see, we saw actually a decrease in governments hiring around education, so that's one number that was low, but companies are still looking for people. You're still hearing it every day. I mean, as you mentioned earlier, I think you might have been Julie saying, some people do eye-cutting back on their employees because they're anticipating what the future might bring, but a lot of companies are still hiring. So with a cut back on employees yet hiring also decreasing or decelerating, if you will, what does that spell out for the people who, during the great resignation, had put in that two-week notice and said, I've got another offer somewhere else. I've got a greater offer on the table. Is this still a job hopper's market, or from your perspective, is it something where that is decelerating so much to the point where it's very much shifting and employee should be considering exactly where they make those moves? I still think it's a good market for employees to look at for better opportunities, but I think what's happening is employers are realizing now they have to do a little more to keep their employees. Employers don't want to hire somebody and then have to six months lose them to another place for higher salary or better benefits. So I think employers are starting to, when I go around talking to companies, they're really looking to hybrid work, how does that work? They're looking at opportunities, childcare, and other things to encourage people to come into their companies. And I think companies are adapting to the change in the environment around workers today. And some of the folks we're talking to are saying some of these changes are going to be long-standing, right? That we're seeing a more profound shift in the workforce because of increased flexibility of being able to work from home, because of sort of life decisions people made during the pandemic, maybe some people taking early retirement, et cetera. How is the administration thinking about some of those longer-term changes and addressing some of those longer-term trends? Well, I think one of the biggest things that President did in the bill back better legislation that didn't go to the Senate, child care, paid family leave, sick time, medical leave, all of those issues are very important to families today. And I think a lot of companies, some of them, getting there on their own, but child care is a very complicated issue. And I think that we as a country have to think about and rethink about the way that our child care system works because it's expensive. And we're having a high-time, retaining workers in that industry because we don't pay them enough to take care of our kids. So I think as we think about long-term, that's going to be one investment on the federal level, but also on the private sector. So I think, you know, pre-piaendemic, we didn't hear about the changes in companies. These companies would change the way they did all right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,56,2022-10-07 17:51:24
2840," investment on a federal level, but also on the private sector. So I think, you know, pre-pandemic, we didn't hear about the changes in companies. Companies would change the way they did office space, open areas, things like that. But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future. And what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. That's not my role. My role is to try and assist them and help with them and share best practices where I can and what other companies are doing. Mr. Secretary, last time we spoke to you about a month ago on jobs day, we're still looking to in analyzing the quiet quitting movement. Now a month later, I have a big problem is this in the country. I don't, I mean, I haven't, I haven't really heard about it from companies. I know that it's being reported in the press. I've talked to a lot of companies in the country and I haven't heard about that. Certainly, that's a concern if it continues on because when people hire people, they expect them to do, you know, days work for days pay. And I think that that's something that we have to continue and encourage. And but when I talk, when I, as I've gone around the country this last month and I've done a lot of trips, no, no, no company has approached me on this quiet quitting idea. And Secretary, watch finally, I want to ask you about the real strike in which you intervened last month and helped avert that strike. That was sort of an 11th hour agreement. I know it was sort of a marathon process, right, of working through it with them. What are some of the lessons learned from that? For example, would you get involved earlier in the future to sort of not have a down to the wire situation? If I'm asked to get involved earlier, I would certainly in the potent negotiation. I'm not involved at the table, but I certainly am talking to both sides to make sure that encouraging both sides and they already asked often encourage them to stay at the table and get this contract done. In the real strike, you know, this was a two-year period that they weren't able to get an agreement where the president had to appoint an emergency board to come up with the P.E.B. They came up with the recommendations and we built off of that. But certainly, you know, I think when you get to that point, there's a breakdown. So I've offered to anybody, anybody who wants if they want me to get involved or get us involved. But I think mediation is important as well. If you have two sides that kids can't get to an agreement, my recommendation is try and bring a mediator in. This is not to be me, but bring a mediator in just to keep the conversation moving forward. And Labor Secretary, just while we have you, we do know that President Biden issued a presidential proclamation pardoning federal convictions for simple marijuana possession defenses. These are people that have been barred in some cases from getting back into the workforce because of these convictions and offenses. Where will the Labor Department continue to do work at the state level, even, to ensure that there are opportunities for people to get occupations within the workforce? Yeah, we have to make sure what the President did yesterday is carried out. And too many of the people that are being pardoned by the President yesterday are people of color, in particular, the African-American community. And this has been a challenge in our country for a long time, where people were convicted of a minor marijuana offense that had a record. And I commend the President for his actions yesterday. And the folks that are out there, we're going to work with them to make sure that they can get into good employment, that this is not an impediment to their ability to get into the middle class and get a good paying job. U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, pleasure to have you on the show and thanks as always for taking the time. Thank you. You guys coming up.

So, September was a rough month all around for stocks. And one company in particular saw a significant drop after withdrawing its 2023 forecast, sending a volatile operating environment. We're talking about FedEx here, folks. And that's what Yowfine's Jaroblickery joins us with today for another edition of Then and Now Jaroblick. That's right, let's turn the clock back to the 1970s where FedEx or Federal Express got its start founded in 1971 in Little Rock, Arkansas. The company officially began operations out of Memphis in 73. And fun fact, the name Federal Express, it actually came about because a founder hoped it would attract the business of the Federal Reserve. It always comes back to the Fed, doesn't it, guys? That original Memphis team consisted of fewer than 400 people yet in its first night of operations, FedEx delivered 186 packages to 25 different countries. Or cities, excuse me, night by 1975 FedEx started installing a drum.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,58,2022-10-07 18:00:16
2842," First night of operations, FedEx delivered 186 packages to 25 different countries. Or cities, excuse me, by 1975 FedEx started installing drop boxes, and we began accustomed to seeing those in businesses. The overnight letter was introduced in 1981, and by 1983 FedEx made American history by becoming the first company to make $1 billion in revenue within 10 years of startup without mergers or acquisitions. In 1978, FedEx went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker that we know FDX and at IPO, at $24 per share. Split adjusted, you got to divide by 32, it is 75 cents. Now, back to the present, we had that drastic mid-September drop of more than 20 percent. And now FedEx is trading around $155 per share. Down more than 50 percent from its May 2021 record high, near $320 per share. So let's take a deep dive into where the company is right now. And on our Dow Jones heat map, actually this is a transports, Dow Jones transports, year to date, we can see FedEx down about 40 percent if we sort by performance. We can see kind of towards the downside. In fact, only jet blue not really appear is down more than that, but you compare it to UPS, which is down 24 percent. And we do possibly have some execution issues. Now, Brian, I know that you've been really following FedEx and especially its guidance as of that last huge drop rate here. And what it foretends for the earning season that we are about to jump into right now. Yeah, Jerry, you really got the sense, alpha, that FedEx, worrying that the economy is slowing down pretty sharply, but to your point, execution has been a big problem with this company, maybe to an extent that hasn't been seen over the prior 25 years. I got to tell you, you cover this space in these companies better than I do, and more closely, but I just know that FedEx kind of releases outside the normal earnings window and perennially, quarter after quarter, they cite these dollar effects problems. And that's just not just this year. This is going years back. So I think there is a temptation to perhaps say that this is an idiosyncratic event. This is particular to that company, but you can't ignore the weight of the evidence with what we've seen of the earnings and the projections for them that we've seen so far. AMD, the latest shot off the bow. Great work, Jerry. I really enjoy these. I know a lot of work goes into them. Thanks so much. All right, Levi's is a top training ticker on the AlphaFine's platform this morning after cutting its outlook. We'll go inside that outlook with Levi's CFO, Harm Eats Inc.

2843," Music Leave I strats out with the beat on earnings and its latest quarter. For a stronger year's dollar, weakness in Europe and ongoing supply and change just ruptions, let the jeans giant to cut its outlook. With more on this, we have Harmeet Singh, Levi Strauss, CFO for more on this quarter. Harmeet, great to get some time with you. I want to go across the pond on Europe. So I would say some surprising results at a Levi's Europe. Did that business how it performs sales and repression? That surprised you? As the high Brian, good morning. As the quarter progressed, it did surprise us. And as you know, we have a very strong brand. As you think about the quarter overall, our quarter was fairly solid, despite all the incremental headwinds. We were up 7% in constant currency with BDPS. And the Levi's brand, just to the strongest quarter three, revenues in a decade. And so as you think about our European business, the weather was fairly warm. And the consumer there is under pressure. And so what we did as collectively as a team is we quickly geared up into action. And looked at discretionary costs. We focused on our direct to consumer business because we have a diversified business model. They are parts of the world that are really strong like Asia and Latin America. And they resisted strong growth. We also had some supply chain disruption, especially in the US, which impacted the business. And so as we thought about the year, we said, okay, let's think about three things that impact the results. One is stronger dollar. The second is supply chain disruptions. And the third is, you know, softening consumer demand in the western part of the world. But if you think of Europe brand, there are parts of Europe that were fairly strong. UK and Spain, you know, were actually countries that grew. I think where we were softwares in Germany and France, the brand still fairly strong, you know, globally as well as in Europe. When you talk about softening demand, Harmeet, is there a relative point that you think back to where this period is analogous to? You know, I would say, you know, we've been as a company, we've been through, you know, good times and tough times. And I would say, as you think about softening demand, you know, I was not here in 0809, but you know, the financial crisis at that time did have an impact. As a company, you know, our toughest period was during the pandemic, where all our stores were shut for about 90 days. And we lost a billion dollars, you know, just like that. But we've as a management team, and I'm really proud of the management team that's been around for a while. We actually geared up into action and said, okay, how do we manage through the crisis? But more importantly, how do we emerge stronger? And then in 2021, we registered our strongest financial aid in a decade. So as we think about, you know, the next few quarters and as, you know, if things do tighten, that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about how do we manage through the immediate crisis, which isn't the near term. But as a company and a brand, you know, we will get out of it and we get out of it stronger. You know, some of you that I invested in June, we laid out longer term targets. These are what we call not start targets, but still get to and focused and delivering them over the longer term. And emerging out of this as a stronger company. I mean, I appreciate the focus on the longer term. I want more shorter term question, which is after the inventory build.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,60,2022-10-07 18:08:14
2844," a below full price, you know, would be impacted about 100 basis points. In Cauter 3, there will be a little bit more about 130, 140 basis points. We have built that into our guidance in Q4, but overall, we still think we will end the year at about, you know, 400 basis points higher than 2019. And that just evidences the strength of the brand. A U R, for example, which is the average unit retail price in Cauter 3, we're still up in the mid to high single digit. That means pricing that we have taken to offset cost is ticking. And our revenues were up slightly, sorry, our unit growth was up slightly. So overall, the brand's really strong. Dockerers, as we have diversified, also grew a lot double digit. And beyond yoga is just starting. We just open our first store in Santa Monica in LA. And if that does well, then we can add a lot of many stores in the active way segment. So overall, our business is fairly diversified, Brad. And our thinking is that we will move through this promotional environment by ensuring that our brand continues, brand equity continues to build. Hey, Harvey, it's Brian here again. You know, I'm a loyal Levi's consumer. But I don't know. I don't know if I'm buying these new baggy dad jeans that you're bringing to market. I don't know if you realize how strong I work for this physique. And those pants are not going to show it off. I got to be honest with you. And you know, the fact is the real democratic brand. We have something for everybody. So if the baggy dad, you know, Jesus, not what you like to wear, it doesn't fit your style. You can wear the tapered look, you can wear the slimmer look. There is something for you, Brad, and for everybody else, across all age demographics, at Levi's. And that's what we are proud to ensure that every consumer gets what he or she needs. Yeah, Brian, the size has got to rock the jorts to show off the gowns. Yeah, he's got to show off the leg. No, look, I'm still the skinny jeans guy. I mean, you got to show off the glutes. You put that time in. I want to show him off on a nice pair of jeans. I don't know. I don't know. There was a little out of fashion here, so we'll take this off like, we'll take this off like, pardon me. It's great to see it. It's not only jeans that you can get from Levi's. You can get more if I had to tell look. You know, I'm wearing a wonderful Levi's shirt, you know, gives a casual look because we continue to bleed those becoming more casual. And the worst becoming more casual brands like us that offer more of a head to toe look, you know, are the ones that will lead the judge. Yes, no matter which of the numbers of the models that you wear on the bottom, I have to say we were expecting either the leather jacket or the jean jacket, Harmeet. So it's good to know you're still wrapping on top with the white shirt. Harmeet's saying great for catching up with you, Levi Strauss, CFL. Thanks, Julie. Thanks. So we're coming up clock the talk, insight into the needs and wants of workers punching in and out of small businesses every day and the interview with HR software specialist home base.

2845," eyes Stocks continue to push lower right now after we got that hotter than estimated, better than estimated jobs report, but that implies that the Fed is going to have no reason to stop raising rates in the short term if inflation, especially if inflation, keeps up as it has been and indeed we saw year over year average hourly earnings rising by 5% as part of the jobs report. Right now the NASDAQ leading the decline down by more than 2.5% that is really characteristic of what we've seen as of late with big cap tech suffering on days like this. And as we just mentioned indeed the jobs report showed continued strong employment. Let's take a front line look at those numbers and especially what it means for small businesses joining us now as John Waldman, HomeBase, Founder and CEO, HomeBase which is a software platform for small businesses essentially manages time clocks, HR, etc. John thanks for being here appreciate it. It's really interesting you guys did some recent survey work and you found 64% of the small businesses you talked to said their financial performance would be better a year from now than it is right now. That seems to fly in the face of everything a lot of what we're hearing right? Yeah good morning joy it's good to see you so we did find that we serve over a hundred thousand small businesses we serve over two million workers and when we surveyed those small businesses they were in fact more optimistic now than they were over the summer by six percentage points in terms of thinking about their expansion over the next year or two. Now that seems kind of weird in the face of everything that we're reading in the headlines but when it comes to small businesses you have to remember this is in the context of such a hard two and a half years first with COVID and forced closures and then into this just truly dramatic labor shortage that they've been living through over the last year and a half so it is actually great to see those signs of optimism from small businesses. What is the experience that you have with those small businesses in terms of how they are navigating this environment right now especially as many of them are trying to best protect the business profitability while at the same time also trying to make sure that they are competitive with wooing the next generation of talent or just workers employees for their businesses. Yeah I first as much as we've been talking about the labor shortage over the last year I don't think we can talk about it this is truly been an incredibly difficult thing for small businesses to deal with and we see that on both sides you have small businesses that are really healthy that can't expand in the way that they used to you know when we look at our data from across over a hundred thousand businesses small businesses are not expanding at the rate that they were.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,62,2022-10-07 18:19:36
2846," that can't expand in the way that they used to. You know, when we look at our data from across over 100,000 businesses, small businesses are not expanding at the rate that they were in 2019. On the flip side, it's actually gotten so bad that we've seen small businesses closed out because they can't hire. There's talking to one of our customers up in Seattle, runs a restaurant, owns a restaurant that had been operating for 10 plus years, and she shut it down, not because the demand wasn't there, not because of inflation, but because she could not hire people to work this business, and she was tired. She and the other owners were tired of filling all the extra shifts. So this is real. This is a real challenge to small businesses, and if we're going to solve this, it's going to take a lot of different things, including making these jobs more attractive. John, have you had to slow hiring at home base? Yeah, that's a great question. We like a lot of tech companies had to revisit some of our plans. Hiring plans coming into this year. We haven't done a layoff or anything like that, but we certainly looked at next year and thought about our own. What can we do? How do we do more with less? We see and our customers doing that for the last two years, and we were asking ourselves the same question. So yeah, we've slowed down our hiring plans. And John, what you just mentioned that Seattle anecdote is interesting to me, because Seattle is one of the places that passed a minimum, a higher minimum wage, right? So you would think that among other things, higher wages would be getting those workers back in. Is it just not working like it used to in? If it's not, what are you hearing from your customers about why it's not? Yeah, well, we're hearing it from our customers, and we're also hearing it from workers. I mean, we're serving two million plus workers, and we're serving them regularly. Listen, wages are always at the top of the list of things that hourly workers care about, but it's not the only thing that workers care about. And we're all staring at the same data on labor force participation and seeing that continue to take down. And I think we all have to take a hard look at this on how are we making these jobs more attractive. Wage rate is part of that, and we have seen that go up with inflation. We have seen that go up in the job posts that are going out and the new hires that people are making through home base. We have a hiring tool that allows people to post jobs, so we can see all of that data. But what we also see in talking to workers is it's not the only thing they care about. They care about flexibility. They care about their opportunity for learning and development. They care about the connection to the business. And this is something that actually small businesses have a great advantage over larger businesses. And finally, John, full disclosure here, we were at a work dinner recently, and I heard you talk about that this is not a short-term problem, that this sort of, especially entry-level workforce is going to be a problem for decades, right? And I guess part of it has to do with population growth, but talk us through that. Yeah, we have been through a pretty traumatic, dramatic two and a half years in the labor market here. You know, we have seen millions of people die. We have seen immigration slow down. We have seen a lot of people leave the labor force. That is a pretty profound impact. But the net results of this of a labor shortage is not going away if you are reliant on entry-level work. In 2027, we reached peak high school graduate in this country. After that, demographics are not on our side here for entry-level work. What that means is that the challenges that small businesses and every business are going through now, we're going to be dealing with that for a long time. And so it comes back to how are we making these jobs more attractive? You know, there's only a couple of solutions for this. Obviously, technology is one of them. How are solutions like us at home base helping teams do more with less? There's obviously immigration, but there's also labor force participation. And so that's what we're really focused on. How do we make these jobs more attractive? How do we help small businesses recruit folks back into the labor force? Because ultimately, we're going to have to do that in the face of declining demographics. Absolutely. John Waldman, home base CEO and founder. Thanks so much for taking the time.

2847," Thanks so much for taking the time. Here with us this morning on Yahoo Finance. You guys coming up? The sequel of Knives Out is coming to the big screen. We've got the details on the other side. The short break. Let's go to BOY music starts. You hear the music, you know what time it is, time for a couple of times. We're going to start with this. Netflix heads to the big screen. The cycle of knives out will be released in theaters for one week around Thanksgiving before debuting on the streaming platform. Interesting. This is the first for the company which has long been against giving theaters and early release here. However, it's done, tandem releases in the past. Mudbound was one of those theatrical productions that also released in tandem on Netflix. One of the first I believe that they actually tested with that. And knives out, I've seen the first one. I think this is so good. Yes. I'm excited about this. I don't know if that'll go and see it in the theater, but definitely what's coming out one week right? Right, exactly. So I don't know what the impetus is. As? Hey, if the James Bond guy's in it, I'm watching. Never heard of this thing before, but James Bond, I liked it. You never saw the last knives out? Never even heard of it. You guys see that. I'm excited about this. I like James Bond. I like Daniel Craig. I'm from James Bond in this movie. Let me just tell you that. I got you. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Oh, that was it. Okay, sauce. All right. Let's, I think I'm doing the attessa and trucks for the holidays. Elon Musk says Tesla will deliver for semi truck ever to Pepsi Co in December. Pepsi ordered 100 trucks in 2017. What production was expected to begin in 2019. And this is quite the truck. I remember when Tesla initially unbelleded, believe it, it's supposed to get 500 miles in a full charge. It is a very, it is a very intimidating looking truck. But I think really it's going to give a good snap to snap shot into what is possible with electric electric trucking and how much perhaps more infrastructure charging infrastructure. We still need in this country. It's coming, but we still need it. And we need it now. Yeah. And this not to be confused with the cyber truck that had a rock thrown at it and still had the window cracked. This is the semi version that Tesla back in 2017 had racked up early orders from the likes of JB Hunter, I believe it was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,64,2022-10-07 18:28:32
2848," They all had the window cracked. This is the semi version that Tesla back in 2017 had racked up early orders from the likes of JB Hunt, I believe it was. Pepsi, Walmart, they had some major purchase orders. Then it just came down to delivery. And at first, I believe that timeline was more closer to 2020 that eventually got pushed out. Yeah, and the Cybertruck VT's was coming too. So there was also a little bit of baby news on that, I guess. All right, coming up in the next hour, you got lots more jobs coverage coming your way. Even as we watch the markets go down, we will all be back in the same location on Monday as we will see whether this selling continues. Welcome to Yahoo Finance. It's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Glickery. And here's what I am watching today. Good news is bad news. Stocks slump as a jobs report misses expectations, but it's a lower unemployment rate that gives a fed more food for thought. It may be space to hike further. The housing market increasingly looks like the first dominant of fall amid declining prices and rising mortgage rates. We're going to speak with the wet bush securities analysts on the outlook for home builders. And could President Biden's move on marijuana change lives and will it impact his standing ahead of the midterms? We're going to take a look at the stocks moving in that space. But first, let's take a look at the stocks after that jobs report. And this is a big one of the week here. And we can see the Dow. Well, let's take a look. The Dow down just slightly here. Looks like it's off about 407 points, maybe a little bit more than slightly. We got the Nasdaq down about 2.5% and the S&P 500 down 1.8%. Now, the bond market, another story, guys. We've seen a lot of volatility in this space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,65,2022-10-07 18:32:36
2849," the NASDAQ down about 2.5% and the S&P 500 down 1.8%. Now the bond market, another story guys. We've seen a lot of volatility in this space. Let's see if we can get some quotes here. We've got the 10 year up to 3.89% and that is a six basis point move. We've got the five year at 4.13% in the 30 year at 3.86% and we want to get more on the market with, yeah, who finances, and S foray. And NAS, you were watching the report, you were charting the reaction to it live on the Wi-Fi interactive. You know, men's work by the way. You know, people's work out, let me get what are some of the numbers sticking out to you after we've had the opportunity to dig into the report? Well, I think that wage gains are still too hot, even though wage gains came down from August, so which was 5.2% to 5%. That is still too hot. That is to say that the Fed has run way to continue hiking rates. And that's why you saw the market reaction. I also thought it was interesting, the number of people who are employed part time for economic reasons. And we've got that number there on a chart for you. And this has seen a decline for the third straight month. So these are individuals that would have preferred to work full time, but they're working part time because either their hours got cut or because they're unable to find full time work. So that number is declining again, a sign that the labor market, while it may be softening a bit, it is still not softening enough for the Fed to pivot. All right. Thank you for that report here in Ness. And we want to continue the labor market discussion and conversation. Check on the roads ahead for the U.S. economy. And for that, we have Gus Vosher, joining us now, PNC Financial Services Group Chief Economist. And let me just ask you your initial reaction to the report Gus, and then anything that sticks out to you. Yeah, so this is a good report. The Fed wants to see slower job growth. I think they prefer to even see even slower job growth than this. But certainly we have seen job growth slow over the course of 2022, as the Fed has raised rates. And that should allow the labor market to cool off as we head into 2023. All right. And then we were just listening to it. And as give some of the statistics, so when you dig into the report, some of the demographic breakdowns may surprise people, maybe some reversals and trends, what did you pick out? Well, certainly we saw the labor force participation rate decline. That's bad news from the Fed's perspective. They want to see more people looking for work. Instead, we saw fewer people. And so that means a tight labor market. And so that makes it more difficult for the Fed. Means they may have to raise rates a bit more. On the other hand, we did see a bit softer wage growth down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is we are seeing a cooling off in the labor market, but it remains too hot from the Fed's perspective. And they're going to need to raise rates more to cool off some of those inflationary pressures. We're seeing in the economy right now. And I've heard some economists calling this report a Goldilocks report. You look at the stock reaction. Definitely to the downside, but maybe that's the bad news. It's good news here because the Fed doesn't want to see stock prices go up. As some of the, I believe it was New Calcash Cari said definitively over a month ago, what are we to make of this in light of the bad news is good news is bad meme that kind of confuses people, especially some of us in the business sometimes. Yeah. So what we want is job growth that is slowing to a more sustainable pace. So, you know, even over the last three months, we've added about 370,000 jobs per month on average. The labor force just simply can't support that. So we need to see much slower job growth that's consistent with underlying growth in the population. We're not there yet. We're moving in the right direction. So, you know, obviously if we're adding a lot of jobs in the economy, that means more income, that means more consumer spending. But at the same time, it's contributing to high inflation. So what we want is okay news from the job market, not good news, but, you know, indications that job growth is slowing and that, you know, we are reaching an equilibrium where those wage pressures in the economy are lessening. And how about the other part of the Fed's mandate inflation? So we have maximum employment. And so, which degree to up half су – inside of big weekly. We're so sure thered. Sp Court has proven your desire to have this worse by calling it social support program on linked to government.

2850," reaching an equilibrium where those wage pressures in the economy are lessening. And how about the other part of the Fed's mandate inflation? So we have maximum employment, stable prices, interpreted to mean 2% inflation, obviously far above that. But what are you expecting out of some of the readings? And how does that fit into the expectations? Everybody waiting with baited breath for that eventual Fed pivot? Yeah, no, we are starting to see inflation slow. I think it peaked over the summer. Obviously, we've seen a big drop in energy prices, although we'll have to see what happens with the new OPEC production cuts. Wage growth is slowing, so that should help bring down inflation. It's going to be difficult. We probably won't see that 2% inflation until sometime in early 2024. But we are moving in the right direction. I think the Fed wants to see both a slowing in the job market and indications that inflation is moving decisively towards 2% before they stop raising rates. I don't think that'll be some time until early in 2023. So if the Fed is going to be looking at the data as they come in and we need to see that slowing in inflation and slower job growth, if the Fed is going to let up. And you mentioned the energy market before. I'm staring at a WTI crude prices at above $91 per barrel. And it was about a week or two ago that it seemed to be about $8 fewer than that. And I'm just wondering, what do the current energy prices say to you? There are people hoping that there would be some mitigation to help out the consumers here. But we had OPEC plus step in, reduce their outlook or reduce what they say they're going to pump by 2.1 million barrels per day. They're already in deficit. What are you making of the energy market and its effect on the US economy here? Yeah, so obviously the OPEC production cuts are not good news for oil prices, for inflation in the United States. That being said, a lot of OPEC members were already below their quotas. And so I don't think we're going to see is that 2.1 barrel per day cut. But I think we're going to get less help on inflation from lower energy prices. But I think the other impacts of the Fed rate heights in terms of a slowing in job growth, a slowing in demand for consumer durables, that type of thing, that will help reduce in those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy, even if OPEC keeps production low. Even if lots of ifs in this business here appreciate your insights on this jobs Friday. Gus Foshe, PNC Financial Services Group, Chief Economist. All right, not the kind of cut you want. Let's take a look at these shares of Levi Strauss, the stock. Looks like it's down 9%. And that's after the clothing company beat earnings estimates, although reporting a miss on revenue, Levi noting continued supply chain disruptions primarily in the US. And that's resulting in estimated miss sales of approximately 30 to 40 million dollars. Now we spoke with Levi Strauss, the CEO, earlier today. And here's what he had to say about the company's road ahead. Let's take a listen. But the next few quarters, and if things do tighten, that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about how do we manage through the immediate crisis, which isn't the near-term. But as a company and a brand, we will get out of it and we get out of it stronger. Now a fairly positive reaction from Levi's CFO, we're going to have to wait and see how things eventually shake up for the jeans giant. And tell you what, coming up after this collateral damage, the Fed might bring down the housing market to its knees in order to tame inflation. But does that mean a full-on crash? We're going to take a look at the investment picture for home builders next. The revenue and the use say the revenue is spreading a lot in the way we can. For the revenue, we are trying to make a big difference in that we are creating this policy. Let's look at the revenue. A production is the biggest investment in the part that hour and hour.

That was a picture of a promotional album princess Kong, which I never had figured behind it. Mom, where will I go? Of course mom. Yeah. Remember what we did for 2019 Selfie, so strong fingers after YouTube Welcome back. You can call it the perfect storm for the housing market. With high mortgage rates, a hawkish fed and recession on the horizon the last time home prices fell this quickly was during the global financial crisis. And though home prices have fallen from peaks in most major US cities, they're still some way above the 2019 levels. But home builder sentiment has been down dwindling. So what does the demand picture look like and what's the investment argument? Let's get into that conversation with Jamie Cannellus, Wed Bush Securities Senior Vice President of Equity Research. Let me just ask you the headline question here. What are we to make of the latest data here and with these soaring prices and home affordability in the crosshairs? Yeah, good morning. Thanks for having me. The longer term, I think the picture for shelter demand, whether that's for sale housing, for rent housing or multi-family for rent, we still think is very strong. And you look at rent growth, double digit percentages up pretty much the entire year for single family and for multi-family. And what we're hearing from the builders is that even with these higher mortgage rates, if they can find a way to get to the affordable payment, whether it's a function of buying down the rate a little bit, maybe taking a little bit off the base price of the home, if they can solve for that monthly payment that the buyer needs, then the buyer is still willing to purchase the home. We think also the demographic tailwind of the millennials that are strongly fully in household formation phase right now, along with the Gen Zs, which is also a very large population demographic. There's lots of tailwinds out there, but I think near term, you're absolutely right. This is a much trickier environment that I think the builders would have expected, especially given how strong the beginning of the year was. And there's almost a substitution effect going on that I've been able to glean from your nose, correct me if I'm wrong, but given the fact that there's not as much demand perhaps for new homes for people to buy rental properties, we're seeing a surge in demand as those as people are forced to pay a shall out money for rent instead of a mortgage, how are those trans looking? They're actually looking pretty good. And what we've heard from our home builders is that you're not going to completely replace consumer demand with the demand from the single family and the build of rent landlords. So youさん there today. Yep.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,68,2022-10-07 18:46:23
2852," And what we've heard from our home builders is that, you're not gonna completely replace consumer demand with the demand from the single family and the build of rent landlords, but it is a more affordable option for people. And it also for the home builders recover. I give them an option to be able to sell maybe some homes that they couldn't sold in this mortgage rate environment. So I'm not gonna fully replace the consumer, but yes, I think the demand for housing, rental housing especially is out there, and it's providing affordable housing for the consumer. But also a means of selling some homes that the builders have, you know, maybe built an expectation, the consumer wanting them, and now they're gonna sell it to these institutional landlords. Either way, it's the emergence of this new fire class over the last decade. I think has been a win-win for both consumers as well as the building industry. That's interesting. When you say fire, talk about finance and insurance real estate, I believe, just in terms of input costs, we can look at the materials and we can get into lumber price, we can also get into wages that are paid. And I think that's appropriate to talk about because we just got a bunch of data this morning from the BLS on the job front. How about these sources of costs for these businesses? So for the, our thesis around the jobs that as long as we're seeing some type of continued job creation, that is gonna be good for demand, good for the industry because typically job growth leads us into recovery and job declines typically proceed tougher times for the builders. So good to see that we are still growing the jobs picture. In terms of input costs, what we've seen is that lumber prices, which have been extremely volatile for most of COVID, actually had a pretty benign quarter, this past quarter in the third quarter, lumber prices are down about 15%. So if you think about a little bit of a tailwind there from lower lumber cost, helping to offset some of the cost that the builders are having to pay to buy down mortgages and maybe cut prices a little bit. So a little bit of relief in a tougher environment. And then from on the wage front, what we've seen is that affordability up until, this meteoric rise in mortgage rates from 3%, 18 months ago to nearly 7%, I think this morning is where they're sitting. Even with the wage growth that we've seen out there, it's hard for affordability to keep up when you see that type of meteoric surge in mortgage rates. Yes, and let's get into some of the investment opportunities for people in the audience. So you have a couple of names that I'm interested in going over, Green Break Partners, Builders for Source, Building Products, Masonite, any of those names you care to describe here and what you're seeing in those stocks. Yeah, absolutely. So Green Break, we have a new trading on it, but if you think about where some of the pain has been in housing, we've seen I think a little bit more of it outweighed. Green Break actually does the majority of their business in Atlanta and Dallas, which are two markets that have held up pretty well. And haven't really felt some of the effects of layoffs on the tech sector, like a rally in an Austin felt. So we're new traded on that name, but I think if you're trying to avoid some of the trouble spots in housing right now, Green Break is an interesting name. Builders for Source is a company that supplies lumber and other products that go into the home. They're about 10% of the domestic building products market now. The decline that we saw in lumber prices has passed quarter. Typically is not as good for them, but if you think about their ability to grow market share and get bigger in this environment, especially because they don't just sell to single family builders, they also sell to multi-family, sell into commercial, which we've seen commercial construction spending actually start to rebound over the last six months. So even though they may be a little bit slower to man for their single family product, they do have other avenues that they can sell into. We're gonna have to leave it there, but appreciate your insights into the housing and construction markets. Jay McCannless, White Bush Securities Senior Vice President of Equity Research.

Coming up, up in smoke, President Biden might just light up his democratic constituencies with a pardon for federal marijuana convictions and we're a month away from the midterms. That story and by theomics next. Welcome back. This week in Bidenomics, Rick Newman is focusing on jobs specifically, unemployment at that rate. Rick, you're take on the morning's numbers here. Good to see you. I'm just going to say what everybody's thinking. We need fewer jobs. We need a higher unemployment rate. All the analysis I'm seeing about the September jobs rate says, basically, all shocks we thought we were hoping unemployment would go up and we thought the jobs number would be lower. And why does everybody want that to happen? So the Federal Reserve has a reason to slow down its interest rate hikes, but with 263,000 new jobs slower than we've seen earlier this year, but still pretty strong, very tight job market. And we now is almost certain the Fed is going to hike another 75 basis points or three quarters of a point in November. So you know, puzzle this one out. We get a pretty good jobs report and the stock market falls by nearly 2%. That's the kind of fun house economy we're in. I think a lot of people just wish, could we get through the slow down in the job market we need to get inflation under control and get to the other side of this? We're just not there yet. No, we are not. But let's move on to something that we are near and that is towards a potential pardon by lots. Let's see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,71,2022-10-07 18:58:38
2855," I think there yet. No, we are not. But let's move on to something that we are near. And that is toward a potential pardon by lots. Let's say anybody who's been convicted on possession of marijuana, at least at the federal level with encouragement by Joe Biden for the states to do something similar. Now, cynics are going to say, well, we're a month away from the midterm elections. Others saying this is really too little too late, but very welcome nonetheless. You're take? Well, it could be too little too late, and it could be political, but it still might be a smart thing for Biden to do. So important to point out, as you said, Jared, he is partening people convicted for simple marijuana possession at the federal level. Most people who've been prosecuted for pot possession, that happens at the state level or the law. Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this Friday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs and Richelle at Cufo. Let's get you up to speed on the market action. And as we round out the week, we are looking at selling once again today as that lower unemployment rate weighs on equities here. The Dow off 656 points in Nasdaq in the red off 400.

Rough close to the week. Thanks, Jonathan. Thank you. Let's get you up to speed now on oil markets still royal by the historic production cut announcement from OPEC plus earlier this week many analysts predicting 100 plus dollars of barrel and prices headed in that direction as you can see WTI at more than 5% Brent up more than 4% and both up more than 10% for the week. Take a look at what this means for drivers gas prices continue to climb back again today they are now 11 cents higher than 1 week ago the national average 389 according to triple A. All right let's get you up to speed now on jobs we saw that September's unemployment rate dropped to 3.5% non farm payrolls were up by 263 to 63000 led by gains in leisure and hospitality but that's also the lowest monthly increase since April of 2021 wages reached up 0.3% marking a 5% increase from a year ago but also taking a look at labor force participation that ticked lower to 62.3% and the size of the labor market also shrank by 57000. Jeffrey Roach chief economist at LPR Financial calls this the nail in the coffin for another 75 basis point rate increase in November for the data dependent federal reserve that potential hawkishness weighing heavily on markets today. Well let's break some of this action down now with our guest Dana Peterson the conference for chief economist joining us now to look at some of these jobs numbers so Dana what really stands out to you as you look at the headline number but also some of the underlying trends you're seeing. Sure certainly there are mixed signals here we did see 263 K in terms of additions and yes it is the smallest that we've seen in quite some time but yet again it's still a very large number in normal times. But we would expect that the number of job gains per month would slow anyway even if we weren't expecting a recession because we're at full employment but certainly with the recession probably upon us businesses are probably starting to pull back on how many people they're hiring. We saw that the Joltz data there were less 1 million fewer job openings but again still lots of job opening so very mixed picture here in terms of yes slowing the labor market but it's still quite robust despite the fact that we're looking at the economic slowdown. Dana the number that jumped out to me was that year over year wage growth number up 5% what do you think this needs just in terms of fed policy the likelihood that the Fed is going to stay aggressive and also is that number that 5% jumped us still way too high in order to potentially bring down course CPI. Sure our thoughts of the Fed are going to continue is going to continue to raise interest rates because inflation is just too high consumer prices and also wages. And so certainly the Fed hasn't really seen much evidence of inflation coming down certainly on these ways data today and certainly not in the core CPI or the core PCE so they're still on track to raise interest rates. They're saying they're going to get closer to 5% in terms of the Fed funds rate and we think that they're pretty serious about that. Dana I'm always watching labor force participation and it was a slight down tick but how significant is any down tick in labor force participation given that we're seeing right now on our screen where was comparative to pre pandemic. Sure it's a pretty volatile number and what we like to do is break it out to two pieces one piece in terms of your prime age workers people 25 to 54 and then the folks who are 55 and over the prime group we're seeing labor force participation rise and get closer to the pre pandemic level. It's been happening in fits and starts but it is happening nonetheless a number of people who are 55 and older that participation rate continues to remain low may those people left the labor market early retired early and they're probably not coming back and so that's all telling",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,73,2022-10-07 19:07:18
2857," that participation rate continues to remain low, many of those people left the labor market early, retired early, and they're probably not coming back. And so that's all telling us that we're still going to have this tight labor market with labor shortages, still plaguing businesses here. And Danny, you're predicting a job full recession. When we talk about the economic impact of that, what does that mean? And what does the next phase of the labor market then look like with this in mind? Sure, what we're saying is that you're probably going to see negative GDP growth in particular, domestic demand being negative, but not a material increase in the unemployment rate or massive job losses. So we're thinking that the unemployment rate might rise to four, four and a half percent and top out there, which would be a very different story relative to what we saw during the pandemic, and certainly during the great recession. And that's because you have fewer workers entering a labor market relative to the number of people who are retiring. So for example, 20 years ago, you had 4.3 working age persons per retired person. That number of shrunken down to three, currently and in 20 years it's going to be just two. So labor shortages are going to be with us for a while, even if we see a little bit of cooling amid the economic downturn. Danny, just what is your assessment of the economy right now because the labor market, it's cooling a bit, although like you're saying, the headline numbers that we're seeing the unemployment rate remaining very, very strong. We've been waiting to see this part of it weekend. It sounds like you don't think it's going to weaken that extensively, but I guess when we try to, I guess figure out how deep of a recession, we could potentially see over the next 12 to 18 months. What do you think is the most likely scenario? Sure, our most likely scenario is that you have a brief and shallow recession. Meaning we have negative readings on domestic demand in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. Now the Fed has updates game in terms of how much it's going to raise interest rates and it's also going to keep interest rates elevated for some time. That signals that inflation, I'm sorry, that the recession could be a little bit deeper, a little bit longer, maybe three quarters instead of just two. But it seems though the rationale of the Fed is we can't drive down inflation without relatively massive job losses, at least north of a million, is that your base case? And if not, how do we drive it down? Even a million job losses wouldn't really move the unemployment rate up that much. It's still consistent with the four, four and a half percent that we're calling for. And so the Fed is not, the Fed also is looking at the same data we're looking at. They're also seeing the labor shortages and the demographic forces that are going to make it less likely for businesses to slash labor. And certainly in those in-person services and also manufacturing construction where you have to physically be on the job, many of those industries didn't even fully recoup all the people that were laid off during the pandemic. They still need workers and they're still trying to get those workers. And certainly if you affirm, if you think that this is not going to be a very long recession or very bad one, you're probably going to hoard workers and hold on to them. So for some of these companies who've not been able to replenish their labor force, what are the solutions? Is it about getting a more flexible workforce in terms of perhaps changing requirements when it comes to things like degrees or hiring people who have been incarcerated before? Is there a lot of wiggle room to get those who either haven't been in the workforce before or are on the sidelines right now? All the things you mentioned are certainly solutions that businesses have been using, but there are some really key factors here. Again, you have many, many people retiring. The baby boomers are wearing the retire anyway. The pandemic just really accelerated that trend. You still have roughly 100,000 missing child care workers. So that makes it very difficult for folks with children to return to the labor market. So certainly that's a solution that businesses can help provide. But also there are policy issues. There, you know, honestly, there are fewer legal immigrants than you might expect. And certainly that we reached a peak back in 2016 and policy is tight and set and it really hasn't changed. So you have a number of factors that are really leading against businesses finding workers, but they're trying everything they're raising, Ranges, Orange, Dudes, and the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,74,2022-10-07 19:11:55
2858," and it really hasn't changed. So you have a number of factors that are really leading against businesses finding workers, but they're trying everything they're raising wages, lowering some of the qualifications, really trying to get marginalized workers, using remote workers a way to attract workers from lower cost to jurisdictions, and from abroad, and also persons with disabilities. But it's still going to be very difficult for businesses going forward. All right, Dean and Peterson, always great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a great weekend. Thank you, you too. Well, we are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live, coming up chip stocks like AMD and Nvidia are getting hammered today over demand concerns.

Stocks falling today on signs that the labor market remains very strong all through the major averages on track for their worst days in three weeks with the Dow well off just over 600 points for more on today's action. What we're seeing we're broadly speaking, let's bring a Jewish chain, JP Morgan's chair of global research. Joyce, it's great to see you when you're taking a look at today's drop of the Dow off 672 points, SAP and NASDAQ both off pretty substantially. NASDAQ off nearly 4% does the drop or seen today make sense to you? Well, look, I think that this is very clear is that the summer of 75 lives on. The market is looking at 75 basis points again. And the labor market has been front and center of the Fed's efforts to reduce the inflationary pressures on the economy and the labor market just continues to run stubbornly hot. So when we take a look at the numbers, you know, we've seen the unemployment rate actually you know, ticking down reversing all of us is move up and that's something that the Fed has to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,75,2022-10-07 19:16:29
2859," hot. So when we take a look at the numbers, you know, we've seen the unemployment rate actually, you know, ticking down, reversing August's move up. And that's something that the Fed has to be very concerned about. So I think, you know, it's 75 basis points and we're still not done there. We're going to see 50 basis points in December, 25 basis points at the beginning of the year until you see a pause. So they're still further to go and it's not just the US, it's also looking at what's happening in the UK and in Europe and in oil markets as well. So I don't think you should be that surprised by what the market reaction was today. And continuing a bit of conversation from our prior segment, how can or can the Fed get inflation back to 2% without some massive job losses with a strong labor market like we're seeing? No, I think the Fed's going to be looking for the three things like is inflation anchored and do you really see that core inflation is coming down? Because you can see this big drop in headline inflation. And then I think it is, you know, war softness in the labor markets. And that's just really what we're not seeing, whether it is looking at the data like the wage growth numbers that have come out, but also just things like the ratio of job levers to job losers. That was one of Alan Green's fans favorite statistics. And that's actually at the highest level that it's been at in 30 years, it's almost 16%. So I don't think that Fed can think about time, you know, slowing at the stage in the game, given what the labor market dynamics are. So, Joyce, then what does that mean for a Fed policy in terms of what will likely get in November? Do you think a 75 basis point hike is a sure thing? And then what do you think December looks like? I think it's 75 basis points. And in November still 50 in December and in January, February, 25 basis points, you know, really seeing policy rates go to four and a half percent. And you know, it's not just the US. I mean, I think in the UK as well, just given everything that's been happening there, you're going to see 75 basis points as well. So the summer of 75, as I mentioned, it really lives on here. Summer of 75. You mentioned the UK and weakness there. There's been an ongoing debate driven by some comments from the UN earlier in the week. If at some point the Fed has to consider the impact of their increases on markets around the world, do they start to consider weakness globally at any point? Well, I think that the focus is going to be very much on the inflation numbers. And that is really even more so than some of the market conditions, something that is a global problem. I mean, if you just take a look at emerging markets, I mean, there's 36 countries where you've got food inflation, like it's about 15%. So I don't think the focus is going to come off of inflation. Financial market conditions are more involved. There's also a lot of attention on the strength of the dollar and what that means because we've seen that central banks around the world, EM emerging markets countries have been drawing down some of those reserves to intervene in the currency. So I think that this discussion is going to continue, but the market conditions of the volatility could be with us for a while. Joyce, you mentioned the strong dollar here. US dollar index moving to the upside once again, today, closing in on 1.13. I guess, how big of a headwind? Do you see the strong dollar being not only in the fourth quarter for corporate earnings, but looking ahead into 2023? No, the strong dollar is going to have a lag defect here. And we're also looking at lower US growth. I mean, we have US growth next year, sub 1%. And we've also seen this really big drop in global consumer confidence. I mean, if you take a look at global consumer confidence right now, it's about 2.8 standard deviations lower than it was in the June 2021 peak period. So that combination of slower growth, stronger dollar, a decline in household savings, a deterioration of consumer sentiment, all of that means that earnings are probably here going to have to be revised. And the dollar really does come out with more of a lag. So given all those conditions that you're stating strategically, how do you position yourself? Well, look, I think I still think one market, and it's one that you know I've talked about here before, is still the energy market. I mean, we do think that oil.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,76,2022-10-07 19:20:27
2860," Yeah, they position yourself. Well, look, I think I still think one market, and it's one that you know, I've talked about here before, is still the energy market. I mean, we do think that oil is going to retest $100 here. And you know, some of this is looking at things like, you know, not just opact policy, but also that the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fund, those, you know, that also concludes where what they have been releasing, you know, at the end of October, you also have the oil price cap, you know, Russia has been threatening some former retaliation as well. So I still think that when you look at the commodity complex, agricultural commodities, we think it could be up 10 to 20% next year. That's true. I've had a little bit of an audio issue there. Up there she's back. JP Morgan's share of global research, Joyce Chang. Appreciate you being here. Have a great weekend. Come on up, Elon Musk, giving a revealing interview, covering everything from his Twitter purchase, China, Tesla. Just wait to hear what he had to say about some of his more controversial tweets. Stay tuned. Fei Hao, And that of the moment, Elon Musk, giving an interview to the Financial Times entitled,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,77,2022-10-07 19:24:47
2861," doing Twitter for the money. It's not like I'm trying to buy some yacht and I can't afford it. I don't own any boats, but I think it's important that people have a maximally trusted and inclusive means of exchanging ideas and that it should be as trusted and transparent as possible. Elon also says of truth social. It's essentially a right-wing echo chamber. It might as well be called Trumpet. That was a big surprise for a guy who has at least apparently courted Donald Trump to return to Twitter, but let's start with the big port on Twitter there, Shana. If I'm an investor, if I'm helping him finance this and he tells me he's not doing it for the money, I'm not so thrilled about my investment or the safety of it. Yeah, not a good move right now, especially given what has transpired over the last 24 hours just in terms of getting funding for this deal. You would think that maybe that wasn't the smartest thing to say. He said he's not doing it for the money. I think it's clear that he's doing it for the attention or that place some sort of role in all this. We know that Musk, Rochelle, does not hide his feelings ever. It seems like when it comes to Twitter, he likes being able to communicate. He said he likes using the platform in order to have direct correspondence with not only his supporters and people who love Tesla, but really a platform for getting his voice heard. I don't think he adds up for debate, I guess. Whether or not he adds much positive, good, I guess when it comes to what he says on the platform, but he does certainly it's safe to say spark a lot of debate. And obviously this isn't the first time that he said he wasn't doing it for the money, but as you mentioned, if you're a shareholder or you're one of these banks that are involved in the financing, that's definitely not what you want to hear. But I think it also speaks to the fact that he does always seem to be driven by something bigger. So whether it's this plan, this, this, everything, this ex-app that he's planning on, there does seem to be a plan in mind. Because you have to remember, at one point Tesla was not profitable, and people were like, where is this company going? And he was, interestingly in this article, basically crediting himself with the amount of speed that now we've seen things like Tesla and electric charging and governments now putting money into it. So maybe there's some big plan in mind. Obviously it does not seem to be money, but a very interesting insight into how he thinks. And he certainly does set himself up for a lot of conflict and trouble when he just sort of, has that sort of verbal diary on Twitter, just says, whatever comes into his mind, because he might end up footing the bill for Twitter, which is exactly how they started. We're the tweet. And back to the, the Twitter and the things he said about it, making an open platform outsourced in the algorithm and things of that nature, we still haven't heard a real plan to actually make money to increase the ad revenue or to get people to pay for a monthly service. And that I'm sure those investors are eager to hear about. But he also said that the sun will eventually destroy all life on earth. Yeah, a little worse. So we need to move at some point, or at least be a multi-planet species. Now it says some interesting comments about President Biden and his age. He did. Yeah, what he said about his age really stuck out to me, basically saying that right now he's too old. He went on to say maybe one generation away from the average age is okay, but two generations at the point where you've got great grandchildren, I don't know how in touch with the people you are, is it even possible to be so we know he hasn't been a good, he hasn't been the biggest supporter of President Biden. He's he's talked about a couple of times how he felt snubbed when he wasn't included in a couple of things that President Biden has done to promote electric vehicles. He did say it doesn't always agree eye to eye with Trump. What he also said Dave, which was interesting to me, was what he had to say in terms of the independent and the super moderate super pack to support candidates with moderate views, which I thought was also an interesting play there. And a very surprising tone for him, strike as well. It recommended reading this article is never dull. Yeah, Richard. True, I mean even including international politics, that's a whole other kind of fish. But as we hear it to break though, we're going to take a look at the big board. The sell-off on Wall Street accelerating that you see the doubt of moving 700 points into the close. Plus an analyst downgrading lived saying that rival Uber has one big advantage. We'll tell you what it is next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,78,2022-10-07 19:29:06
2862," I It's time for a triple play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading with Dexcom, Lyft and Credit Suisse. My pick is Biotech Company Dexcom, ticker DXCN. The company's focus is wearable continuous glucose monitoring or CGM associated with diabetes. Despite a market sell-off overall, the stock is still jumping up almost 7%. Fast after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a proposed local coverage determination. That actually paves the way for it to be covered by Medicare in certain regions. That was welcome used to analysts, including Piper Sandler's Mato Brian, who raised the price target to $120 from $110 per share, saying DXCN will reclaim its position as the highest multiple name in diabetes following this announcement. We also heard from Wells Fargo's Larry Beagle, who says if finalize this, we'll double the market opportunity for CGM to 8 million patients per year. But of course, rivals in the space, the Abbott Laboratories and SensorNics holdings under pressure following that news. And of course, it's been a bumpy year overall for those companies and for Doxcom as well. That stock down 22% year to date, Shauna. You ever show you mentioned some of the analyst commentary. They're still still out, uping its price target to 120 a share, saying that this is clearly a positive development. But quote, seemingly little in the way of proposed patient restrictions are. So big reason why we're seeing that positive analyst commentary, big reason why we're seeing the stock pop as much as it is today. And overall, the street is very bullish on this name. This stock out to me 15 buys, two holds and zero sells on the stock. So when you're taking the account that Doxcom's still off 22% year to date, yet there's zero sell ratings on the stock right now, really shows how bullish the street is at this point. All right, my play today is Lift. The stock sinking on a downgrade from RBC analyst Brad Erickson, cutting his rating on the stock to sector perform. And worry about its big rival, Uber. So Erickson warns it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,79,2022-10-07 19:33:45
2863," lift the stock sinking on a downgrade from RBC analyst Brad Erickson cutting his rating on the stock to sector perform. I'm worried about its big rival Uber. So Erickson warns at Uber quote has a structural supply advantage when it comes to driver setting longer wait times for lift riders. He also acknowledged that he is a little bit late to the game when it comes to this reduced outlook. Remember, lift has had a very tough go at it since it started the year. It shares off just about 70 percent. We're seeing the drop today on this downgrade. You and I have talked a number of times and it's a big theme today. The labor shortage trying to attract some people into the workforce I have remained on the sidelines. A lot of companies simply can't get the workers they need unless they're offering very, very attractive incentives. It looks like at least from RBC's perspective, lift is unable to keep up with that demand. It's not a great sector to begin with. I mean, Uber's down 5.5 percent today on a broader market to climb it down what 35 percent year to date. It's surprising to me to see any difference between Uber and lift in terms of that perspective because I don't know about you. Most of us get online and look at both day to day. At least when I fly into an airport, I compare both and they're generally in the same neck of the woods. It was the first time since May of 21 that Uber's times were actually faster than lift. So lift had been much stronger and in particular that focus is in the West Coast. Play 33 percent slower are their times according to this analyst note. So that is problematic for lift, but not a great sector either way. My play Credit Swiss, one of the stock stories of the week with many suggesting a Lehman like collapse could be in the early stages. You saw Lehman trending most of the weekend and early throughout the week. It certainly has not played out that way though. The stock surging today on a planned restructuring, the Wall Street Journal reporting 10 bidders, including six street partners have submitted offers for the bank, Securitized Product Group. CS also announcing a surprise, $3 billion buyback of its senior bonds. And list still suggests though they could need around $5 billion in fresh cash to totally stabilize things. But shares have certainly circled the wagons up more than 12 percent today, up more than 22 percent on the week. I guess for now it looks like much to do about nothing, Rochelle. I mean, when you have your company's name mentioned in the same as Lehman Brothers, that's never going to be a good side. Obviously, at least they seem to at all be making some moves in the right direction trying to cross some of the concerns here. But I don't know if this is going to be enough. Obviously, this is one of these story banks. You would think that there could be some sort of recourse here, but still early days, but obviously never great when you're mentioned against another name that's collapsed. Yeah, but I think the reaction at least at this point is it doesn't look like a Lehman, right? When you compare the strong balance sheet at Credit Suisse compared to what we saw back in 2007-2008, it certainly is a very different scenario. And also the buyback, the move there from Credit Suisse really shows the fact that the company is not, I guess, as financially distressed as maybe some of the initial fears were when we initially saw this reaction and so on a lot of the talk going back to last weekend. But again, Credit Suisse clearly has a long ways to go. We'll be interesting to see the moves that the company makes in order to better position the bank and also really it's balance sheet here for the future. All right, coming up, the Biden administration is hoping its latest announcements delivers a blow to China's chip industry, the details of the latest volley in the ongoing US-China chip war next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,80,2022-10-07 19:37:45
2864,"dles All right, take a look at shares of FedEx. Well, it's a little over 1% under suppressors. The company's ground division reportedly cutting its volume forecast for holiday shipping and an internal memo obtained by Reuters FedEx saying its customers planned to ship fewer packages. This news coming just two weeks after FedEx pulled its full year guidance and announced its first quarter profit fell 20% from a year ago. Well, Chip stocks are falling today after the Biden administration announced clamping down on China's access to chip technology. Meanwhile, the world's top maker of memory chips, AMD and Samsung, a sparking fears that a slump in semiconductor demand could be much worse than expected. Let's bring in Vivek Arya, Bank of America, senior semiconductor analyst to take a look at all of this. So, Vivek, welcome back to this show. What should we take from this? When we look at some of the chip makers that are down the most year to date, led by Nvidia, what is it that concerns you about the trend you're seeing right now? Yeah, thank you very much for having me. I think the semiconductor industry is one that makes us feel very profitable and productive for three years in a row. And then just makes us feel awful in that fourth year and it seems like we are in that fourth year. The specific things that are causing the headwinds this year are threefold. First, there is just enormous pressure on the consumer because of all the inflationary issues because of all the turmoil in Europe because of the lockdowns in China. Secondly, we have the specter of rising rates, which is never good for valuations in high beta, high multiple sector. And then on top of it, as you mentioned, there are some additional restrictions on semiconductor companies in terms of shipping to China and look, China is the largest customer for semiconductor. And it's never good to have friction between the largest designer of semis, which is the US and the largest customer. So I think where we are today, when I put it all in the context is the semiconductor stocks have a way of smelling the turn in the economy, you know, six to nine to 12 months before it happens. So last November, when semiconductor stock speak, there was no talk of recession. The same way there is no talk of an upturn or the next cycle today. So our assumption is that compare start to get easier for the sector next year. And if that is the assumption and if that's the right assumption, we think semiconductor stocks can try and find a bottom sometime in Q4. And meanwhile, the valuations are starting to look very interesting for what's a very profitable industry. So the fact that's interesting just in terms of what you said to export restrictions and then taking that and coupling that with you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,81,2022-10-07 19:42:05
2865," starting to look very interesting for what's a very profitable industry. So the fact that's interesting just in terms of what you said to export restrictions and then taking that and coupling that with your predictions, your expectations for this base going into 2023. So it sounds like you view it as a challenge here in the near term, but you don't think it's going to have a significant impact in terms of sales, is that right? Yeah, so let's talk about those restrictions. So first of all, you know, as I mentioned, friction is never good between the largest designer and the largest buyer of semiconductors. But when you take a step back, the majority of chips that are shipped to China are actually for a lot of consumer applications. Therefore smartphones, therefore PCs, therefore a lot of low and consumer speakers and so forward, like the largest buyers of semis in China are not supercomputing or military companies. They are companies like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, ZTE. So it's not really supercomputing. In fact, if I take the entire supercomputing and military end use market for semiconductors, globally, it is not more than 5 or 10% of end demand. And even if you assume half of it is in China, which is a very big number, it still says that there is not more than a 5% or so headband. Second point I would mention is that we have to be careful when we use the term restriction. So what is happening is that there is a set of rules that now forces a lot of semiconductor companies to first go and ask for approvals. So they are not actually banned outright from shipping. They have been given this extra step to go and verify that the end customer is not a military end use customer or a supercomputing customer that might be on an entity list. Which is why we think that yes, it's a headband and it doesn't help when the sector is already facing a lot of the macro pressures, but in terms of specifically this incremental headband, we don't think it's more than 5% to 7% incremental. And that too, it's only applied to very specific set of companies. In fact, I want to draw your attention to something that we saw from tourist securities. In talking about Tesla, perhaps being a dark horse when it comes to AI and perhaps arrival for Nvidia, saying that they actually see it obviously though Nvidia is the leader in this space. They see apart the Tesla to build its own business to compete with it. What's your take on perhaps the role that some of these non-traditional chip makers like a Tesla might play in this space? Sure, absolutely. Look, first, when it comes to the field of artificial intelligence, we are still in the first innings. That means if I take all the servers that were shipped in the world in the last year, less than 15% of them actually had an AI accelerator in them and the majority of them used in Nvidia product, and then if I couple that with the automotive industry where Tesla participates, the entire automotive industry is only 8% of the semiconductor market. So I think we have to keep a lot of these things in context of what the sizes of these markets are. So we really like Nvidia. And the reason is that their specific technology of AI accelerators, it's not just a chip. They're not just designing a chip. They're actually designing a complete end-to-end system and a stack of software and a stack and a big number of developers, three and a half million developers that have been trained on using this product. So I would say the Tesla use case is a very, very specific one, maybe less than 1% of the entire semiconductor industry. But it is a rising tide. Many companies will participate. But we think Nvidia is on a different not so different planet, but I think on a different solar system, when it comes to the application and the benefits of AI. The VecGarria, always great to get your perspective. A Bank of America, thanks so much for joining us today. Well, stick with the chip makers and what we're seeing play out in the semiconductor space. The micron is the latest company to take advantage of the funding from the Biden administration's $52 billion chips act announcing plans to invest up to $100 billion for a plant in Syracuse, New York. Joining us now is a man who helped us seal that deal. You want to welcome Syracuse, Mayor Ben Walsh to the program. Mayor Walsh, it's great to see you. Congratulations on this historic deal between the city of Syracuse and a micron year. Just talked to us just about the economic implications of this and the opportunity that this presents for your region. Transformational is probably an understatement. We have been working for a long time to prepare our community for this opportunity. And this week was historic. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,82,2022-10-07 19:46:25
2866," probably an understatement. We have been working for a long time to prepare our community for this opportunity. And this week was historic. So really immediately our focus shifts towards what we need to do to be prepared for this opportunity. Clearly we have to make sure we have the workforce. We're going to see significant investments in housing. But it's very exciting for an older northeastern industrial city like Syracuse. It is part of a really amazing comeback story. A story some day you'll have to write in a book how a small town or at least medium town, $400 billion in investment. How do you do it? Because other companies, other towns across the country are watching to see exactly how they can do it. What was the key? Well there are so many factors that went into it. We have a great site. The site is located about 15 to 20 minutes north of the city of Syracuse owned by the Anadogga County Industrial Development Agency. They've been investing in that site for nearly 30 years now. It is about 1400 acres now. So we had the right site. We had the support from New York State government. Governor Hoagold made a significant investment. The chips act at the federal level was critically important. And right here in the city of Syracuse, you know, we have been in the midst of our own. Renaissance a lot of investment downtown. The city is really coming back and as companies are trying to attract and retain talent. I'm having a vibrant city as a critical component. And I'm proud to say we have that here in Syracuse up to 50,000 jobs are expected to be created as a result of this. I guess how do you prepare? How do you build up the workforce in order to fill that large number of jobs? Well, it takes time and I'm pleased to say that we're not starting right now. We've been at this for quite a while now as part of our Syracuse surge strategy, which is our strategy for inclusive growth in the new economy. As we've identified opportunities in the what we call the fourth industrial revolution. We've seen certain areas where Syracuse has a competitive advantage where we have. Curriculum in our schools that we're developing that can make sure that our that our people and our workers have the right skill sets. So we have a lot of the right programs and infrastructure in place. This opportunity is just going to require us to scale them at a rate that we've never done before. So again, looking at scaling our workforce development programs, continuing to invest in housing, public transportation, all of the infrastructure that we need to accommodate this investment. So 9,000 of those jobs should make an average of $100,000 each that is remarkable. As remarkable as this achievement was spent, I'm inspired by an independent mayor winning 60% of the vote in your second term. Is this something that we can see spread across the country? What allowed you to to run as an independent because the narrative in this country is that it is a dominated two party system and you simply cannot break through? Well, I'll describe it within the context of this deal. The fact that we have an independent mayor, a Republican County executive, a Democratic governor, all working hand in hand to make this deal happen is significant. And I think does provide a model for other communities to pursue at a time when our country is very divisive. I think when when people focus on what we have in common and where we can have shared prosperity and growth. You can make things happen. So I hope in that way we are a model that we are where America is going or hopefully we want to be going. And as for me, you know, it's about it was about developing and bringing together a broad coalition, broad diverse coalition of people that had a love for this city and that we're willing to set party politics aside for the greater good. Well, speaking of being a model, making things happen clearly. This is a huge win for your city. Are you in talks with other large companies? What else are you doing to attract jobs to your city of Syracuse? Well, similar to the point about our programs in place, you know, our comeback story, our Renaissance is already underway. We have a facility on the south side of Syracuse just out the downtown local company, JMA wireless just just constructed the first 5G wireless manufacturing facility in the United States. We have other investments like that taking place, nothing to the scale of micron and we certainly see know that there will be significant.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,83,2022-10-07 19:50:45
2867," facility in the United States. We have other investments like that taking place. Nothing to the scale of micron. And we certainly see, know that there will be significant follow-on opportunities, supply chain opportunities that come with micron. But we do hope that this also puts us on the radar of many other companies around the globe that are looking for a place where, again, you have the political alignment that allows you to do business that has the balance of a vibrant downtown, but also beautiful parks and countrysides and mountains and lakes all around us. So it's really pulling all of that together. Well, congratulations on the deal. Nice to join us, Sarah Q. Smer, Ben Walls. Appreciate it, thanks. Thank you. All right, what's old is new again. Some streaming services are feeling the chill from the lack of customer interest. So now, yep, they're considering bundling. More about that ahead. Hm. We could soon be seeing more streamers partnering for bundles. According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, Amazon executives have been exploring selling bundles of streaming services at discounted prices through its Amazon Prime video channels. The Journal also reported that Warner Brothers' discovery has discussed participating in bundles with some of its rivals. It really does seem as if we're coming full circle, but we're seeing some analysts saying we're not going back to the days of cable not to compare. He was saying, and this was from a Devon Emory of Curiosity, he was saying that the problem with bundling wasn't that people didn't like it. They weren't liking what they were paying for a service that they weren't really using. A bit of nuance there though, Seanan. Would you agree though? Yeah, but I guess my only response to that would be, I guess if you pay for a bundle, I don't know if you would necessarily use everything that's included in that bundle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,84,2022-10-07 19:55:27
2868," Yeah, but I guess my only response to that would be, I guess if you pay for a bundle, I don't know if you necessarily use everything that's included in that bundle. So I'll be interesting to see. And also just in terms of the pricing that's going to be key, we don't really know from this report from the journal exactly what Amazon is thinking if Prime is going to be included in these bundles or if they're thinking of maybe partnering with some other streamers and bundling their services. It's very, very vague just in terms of where they see the direction of this going. Dave, though, I do think it is a natural step in order for us to see more of these types of bundle offers. So just given the fact that growth there within the sector has been so hard for so many of the leaders here within streaming, we certainly have seen saturation. So many companies are trying to be innovative in terms of what they're doing to drive new customers, to get new customers into their service here. Ad tier is part of that, but bundling, I think, makes sense. It'll be interesting though to see how they do it. Well, we just showed the two main bundles that do exist right now. With the leader out of the gate really is that one on your left there. Disney bundle has Disney Hulu and ESPN plus, and that makes a lot of sense for people. That's a 44% discount off of if you paid for all three of those services separately. But now some research from CR research shows that the average consumer is spending $219 a month right now between cable and their streaming services. So everything we got away from, we are now back in. And that's why the Wall Street Journal calls it the great re-bundling. Perhaps the best example of what Amazon might do is what Walmart's doing with their membership now getting a deal with Paramount Plus and partnering there. But there's no natural streamer that fits with Amazon Prime because they have everything in the space now with movies and television shows and now live sports. I can't imagine who a natural partner would be. But yes, we're getting back to exactly what we ran away from. And it's tough because when you figure in Walmart their services are already $98 so people are just going to do these sort of mini bundles. Will it be a bunch of overlap if you want a bit of something and something else? Do you have to get two bundles? It's a lot. I'm not looking forward to it. But hey, if it gives us more options we can save like 44%. I will do the bundling math. I will try. All right, we'll stick with us here coming up. We're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stick with us here. On Yacht & Finance Live.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,85,2022-10-07 19:59:22
2869," Music I would just a couple of minutes from the closing bell on a sell off Friday, Yahoo's Jared Bliquerie's black again with another devastating Friday. Seems like I've been doing this week after week. It's a pattern with me. I don't know if it's just me. I should take off next Friday. It is my birthday. So that's what's going to happen. We need to see a turnaround. Dave, you might have one next week too. I'm not going to say anything. Anyway, here's a doubt for the week. Still up 2% over the trailing five days. I think the NASDAQ down 4% at the lows has given back almost all of that. Well, 8% of a percent. And then the S&P 500 up less or down less than 3% here, maintaining gains about 1.5% into the close. And it has been a wild week that jobs report a little bit too hot for the market. Just take a look at this. In video down 8% is it's taking lower, it's actually down 6%. The mega caps really taking it on the chin. Just take a look at the sector action. We can see with 30 seconds left. It's a tech sector. That's XLK. That is the biggest to the downside. That's down 4% followed by consumer discretionary down over 3% even energy, which has been the one buoyed stock or sector this week. That is down 3.25% and we take a look at some of the sector heat maps here. I wanted to show you a little bit of green here. Got a little bit of green, but you take a look at travel. It is the opposite story. Here's the bell. It's fine on one of the weeks. Stocks ending the day. Let's take a look at how they finished all three major indices off their session lows, but still in solidly negative territory. As we take a look here, we see the Dow there. Off its session lows though, but still ending down about 629 points. That's 2%. The S&P 500 also losing more than 100 points. The Dow is down 2.8%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq taking the heaviest losses of the day, losing 3.8% down 320 points. Let's take a closer look at those border markets with our markets panel. Let's bring in a Med Riesco in Signo Chief Investment Officer and Todd Sons, strategic managing director of technical strategy. A big welcome to you both. Let's start with you getting your reaction to where we are in terms of what we're seeing with this market rally. Obviously, this came off of the bad news that we got in the jobs markets. Now we have another swing in the opposite direction. Right. So really, I think the market's not going to be able to rally here in any sustainable way until we get a pivot from the Fed. And a pivot doesn't necessarily mean reduction in rate hikes. It also means a pause. And the jobs number today really did nothing to change that narrative or to push that timetable forward. If anything, I think what we continue to see is continuing strength in that labor market. It's one of the reasons why the Fed has to continue to time. That labor market is still quite strong. Remember, there's still 1.6 workers for every job available out there. So there's a big moat around the U.S. labor market. Todd, what do you think of that strong jobs number that we got out this morning? The fact that the unemployment rate continued to fall or fell once again. I should say the reaction that we're seeing play out in the broader markets, does this big of a drop do you think makes sense? Yeah, I think what stands out most to me right now for as much as we had strong participation in breath earlier this week and some improving economic data, speaking inflation perhaps, what hasn't changed is the very difficult macro backdrop, right? The dollar starting to re-engage itself higher. The yen after a monumental intervention by the bank in Japan, it fresh highs today, right? So the FX market continues to play the role of the villain here. You know, you have fed that's intent on continuing to tighten. And our risk barometer such as discretionary versus staples, I think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,86,2022-10-07 20:03:53
2870," The next market continues to play the role of the villain here. You know, you have this Fed that's intent on continuing to tighten. And our risk barometer, such as discretionary versus staples, I think this is the most important ratio right now for the market. Still it's very inconclusive coming off the March 2020 lows. It was decisively in favor of risk on for discretionary. It's a much different backdrop right now as much as we're trying to hold on to the June lows. That leaves us very skeptical despite any sort of improving economic, economic front, whether it's jobs or other data. Yeah, good news is bad news. I mean, how do you think the Fed reads today's jobs numbers? Look, I think you see it in the Fed funds futures. They are basically now saying that there's a very high chance that the Fed hikes, uh, hikes by 75 basis points at the next meeting and then 50 and then 25 subsequently. So it's really kind of given back some of the reduction in Fed hiking expectations that kind of drove the market higher earlier this week. So really, I think it kind of leaves the Fed in the same position that it was at the last meetings. Still data dependent. Remember, we still have one more CPI print before the next meeting. I think that'll be the next big economic number to watch. Um, and if we're going to see sort of any cracks, let's say in the Fed's rhetoric so far, that could be potentially one spot where that could happen. And Todd, I want to ask you that as you take us a step back, where are you seeing then some of these funds flowing into? Some people have cash on the side. Others are wondering what to do. Where are you seeing investment flowing right now? Yeah, I think the greatest asset for the market ran out is sentiment. And right, when you look at third quarter sector ETF flows, it was decisively defensive. Utility, staples, healthcare. So the most amount of inflows, conversely, you had cyclical outflows from materials and dust, fuels and energy. And those defensive flows were also paired off with a surge into cash like treasury. Now, part of that is because you're actually getting a yield on cash for the first time and what feels like ages, right? But you typically see these surge into cash like flows during crisis moments, the China devaluation, COVID, the Fed tightening in 2018. And so I like that the sentiment backdrop is supportive, but it's hard to square that away with a very difficult macro backdrop. Now, that being said, the outflows from energy are still amazes to me despite the great performance, especially this week for that sector. So if you're looking for someplace to hide where the flows are not aggressive, take a look at energy. I'm at a big story next week is going to be earning season in addition to that inflation print that we are waiting for. But big banks are set to kick it off this year. When we talk about the fact that we have seen a revision lower here in a number of estimates, had they been revised low enough? And I guess what do you expect this round of earnings to tell us just about the state of the economy right now? I think more than anything right now, we're still working on the discount rate. We're still working on the multiple because the market hasn't really settled on that. You've seen a lot of volatility there. Earnings have come down quite a bit already. Now I will tell you, we are projecting a mild recession in the United States over the next six months. And it seems to me that, and this is something that your previous guests mentioned as well, sentiment and positioning are kind of pointing to limited losses from here in case of a mild recession. In that scenario, we would see the S&P trade anywhere from 3400 to 3600, which is just about where we are today, perhaps a little bit lower. But I think the market's downside is quite limited. I think the only place or the only potential scenario where we see the market fall much further from here is in the case of a hard landing. And really that would require we think a shock in top of what we already have right now, such as something emanating from the war in Ukraine, which we're obviously not a positive right now as a base case. And Todd, your thoughts on trading sideways for the next couple of months and expectations for earnings, which get underway next week? I do think volatility is here to stay, right? You've seen FX ball, you've seen Treasury ball, and surprised the VIX is still roughly around 30, perhaps there's some other hedging derivatives what not going on. But you typically need to see the VIX at least spike to 40 or 50 before is all said and done. I think ultimately, you may need to see the S&P, especially if we're getting into recessionary territory, go back to somewhere around 3,300, right? Where the COVID, the pre-COVID highs were. Right, a lot of stocks already starting to tell you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,87,2022-10-07 20:08:10
2871," You may need to see the S&P, especially if we're getting into recessionary territory, go back to somewhere around 3,300, right? Where the COVID, the pre-COVID highs were. Right, a lot of stocks already start in a test, those levels, particularly in the real state area, or even look at something like meta has already below its COVIDs low. So you may ultimately need to see from a structural perspective, the S&P tests somewhere in the 3,300 area before it's all set and done. That's going to put us in rare territory in a greater than 30% decline, but it should prove to be a very strong buying opportunity, as the Struckler speaking, it's rare air if you get down that low from 52-ig high. There's something lots to keep an eye on for us and for the Fed as well. A big thank you to our market panel, Ahmed Riesco and Todd Sone. Thank you both. All right, stay with us. Coming up, nearly 400,000 women dropped out of the labour force last month. We'll find out why next. The latest job numbers are out and they show a big disparity between men and women in the workforce. 10 million more men are employed than women. And 17 million fewer women are in the labour force than men overall. We want to bring in pipeline equity CEO, Katakarroy, joining us now. It's great to have you here in the studio for the first time in quite some time. 390,000 women though in this report we've just got out this morning leaving the labour force last month. And I have talked a number of times about women staying out of the workforce. Now we have even more women leaving. Why do you think this is? Well, there's probably, there's a couple of reasons. One is that as we see fewer jobs, right? tend to be the last hired and the first fired that's certainly part of what's happening. The other piece is digital acceleration so the jobs that existed at the beginning of the pandemic don't exist not necessarily exist right now so we need to actually.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,88,2022-10-07 20:13:02
2872," The other piece is digital acceleration. So the jobs that existed at the beginning of the pandemic don't exist, not necessarily exist right now. So we need to actually skill women into the jobs that are available. So, Karthik, event, how do we get women to get into the jobs that are now available? How do we sort of connect those dots? Yeah, there's really two pieces. One is this equitable skilling, which has two focuses. One is actually having women have access to skilling opportunities. So for instance, in the infrastructure bill, 100% of those jobs need skilling. So that's one opportunity. But the other is actually ensuring that women have the equity of opportunity to apply those skills. Because we know, for instance, in STEM, that half of all women will actually leave in the first 10 years in STEM. And Karthik, all right now, we're in a time of high inflation. The Fed has gotten very aggressive. You're digging down and telling us that rate hikes actually affect women more than men. How so? Well, there's two pieces. So we know, for instance, the inflation rate for goods and services that are targeted toward women are double that for goods and services targeted toward men. But the other thing is that as the Fed raises rates, it's actually a higher credit risk to be a woman. So we get charged higher rates for mortgages and car loans. So right now, as we hear the Fed is going to continue to remain very hawkish, potentially weakening the economy. Right now, we have 1.5 million women that still haven't returned to the workforce. What do you think that number will look like 68 months from now? That's a great question. I don't actually know. But what I know is that it will likely get worse before it gets better. And one of the things that's really unfortunate about what the Fed is doing is that it's actually harming women. If we brought those 1.5 million women back into the labor force, we could actually close the gap between the number of jobs open and then a number of people looking for jobs by almost 35%. That would cool the economy so that we don't have to continue to raise rates. And, Katika, you've talked about the Fed considering women when they look at this picture of full employment. What do you think they're missing in the picture right now? They're not looking at it through an intersectional gender equity lens. So they're not looking at it through the lens of gender plus race and ethnicity. So for instance, we talked about the 1.5 million women that are missing from the labor force. If you look at that through intersectional gender equity, so specifically for black women and Latinas, black women are currently at over 8% since the beginning of the pandemic. And Latinas are a little bit over 6%. So they have not reached full employment. If we actually put policies in place to increase their employment and their participation in the labor force, we will cool the economy. Katika, when you take a look at the breakdown of minimum wage workers between men and women, how does that stack up? And I guess how does that compare to what we saw pre-pandemic? Well, women are the majority of all minimum wage workers in the United States. It's about 56%. One of the real concerns is that this year, the wage gap is actually widened for almost every woman. So it's 5 to 11 cents. That's on top of inflation-adjusted wages we're actually earning less. And so not only do women have less money coming into their wallets, they actually have more money coming out. So then, Katika, for some of these companies who are looking at this and thinking, what is the business case for hiring more women, whether it affects their bottom line or how it affects the economy? How do you convince them that it's not just a nice to have those of smart business as well? Well, that's pipeline started with research. We did a research study across 4,000 companies in 29 countries. And what we found was that for every 10% increase in intersectional gender equity, there's a 1% to 2% increase in revenue. Here's what's interesting about that. As we're looking at the softening of the economy, the return for investing in equity during a downturn is actually double. So right now, companies should be doubling down on ensuring equity in their labor force and not just hiring and not only pay, but things like performance, potential, and development. Very important message for everyone involved, especially for those companies that are hiring right now. Katika Roy, great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us in studio.

Thanks so much for joining us in studio. Thank you for having me. All right, coming up next, President Biden pardoning thousands of people convicted of simple marijuana possession. Find out what this means for cannabis companies next. Music The pot's stock high wore off quick following President Biden's announcement of historic federal pardons from marijuana possession while most multi-state operators climb between 20 and 30% Thursday most are flat or down slightly today. So what's the level of optimism in the industry? Andrew Carter is the Steeple cannabis analyst and joins us now. It was a massive announcement and shocked the world, including the stocks, but then it seemed everything came back down to earth. What's your level of optimism and what changed as of that announcement? Well, first off, thanks for having me. The first point is though the pardons, it doesn't really accomplish much. There's very few simple marijuana charges at the federal level for just possession. Most of those are done at the states and don't have to be done there. The third thing was kind of interesting that we could, he is kind of signaling that he wants to start the process of reviewing marijuana status. That can change through the executive branch. Is more bureaucratic, it goes through the FDA, but you ask what changed. Well, yesterday nothing really changed about the category. It's a difficult category right now. I think you could see the negative of yesterday, but it didn't sustain into it today is that you do have a problem both the USA and Canada of too many players in the category. If you open up capital, that could only make things worse. So it's hard to say where things change because it best if...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,90,2022-10-07 20:21:24
2874," problem both the USA and Canada of too many players in the category. And if you open up capital, that could only make things worse. So it's hard to say where things change because it best if we do go down this process of descheduling, you're going to get, it's going to be a long process. And as we wrote, I'm not sure you're going to like the like what's at the end. The one silver lining is maybe safe act does have a better chance of happening in the late duck session out of this. Yeah, I found a notable that Kim Rivers, uh, Trulief CEO joined us, said it was better late than never as for the pardons, but called it historic and monumental as for the potential rescheduling. Uh, in terms of the investment space, though, did anything change if you are a cannabis investor? No, the category is still in a tough place. Let's go go around the world for the hydroponic stocks that we cover, which is actually kind of one of the broader classes where you best include Scott's Miracle Grow. The category still amidst a great, a really great recession when we have too much capacity, WM technology, kind of a leading cannabis tech vehicle. I think that we think that they have a strong value proposition over time. They've won the very few brands in cannabis, but retailers are still under pressure in their markets. Canada says really nothing to do with Canada, but Canada is a difficult market. It's increasing for, increasingly fragmented, very competitive and a difficult structure. And for as far as Canadians being able to invest here, well, I don't know why I'm excited about Canadians suddenly being able to invest in US if assets were to re-rate, which is they would do. MSOs, I mean, I'll defer to my colleague Andrew Partheno on that one, but the US MSOs, it doesn't change anything overnight for them, but there is that silver lining of opening up capital of being safe and if that does pass. Yeah, we still know real optimism because not a single Republican in the Senate has publicly supported safe. On what's your level of optimism? I mean, a timeline on actual federal legalization and beyond that, what could change the investor story? Yeah, sure. I'd say for the safe fact, I mean, I think odds are better. And now we know that. And I think in particular because President Biden did do the pardons. So that take potentially provides some progressives cover. Now what we'll get into the nuances of pardons versus expungements and see if see if the some of the aggressive take refuge in that. So a little bit better, but my timeline on it, I guess I'd be, we could, I think because President Biden has signal this, maybe even it could lead to Congress wanting to take up the issue themselves as to not leave this and not leave it to the attention consequences. Maybe something does happen within the next two years, but I think that, that is an optimistic case in itself. Yeah, I think we're a political win than anything else as we approach the midterms and gas actually goes back up. He needed some sort of October surprise for a win perhaps though till raise reporting gives us a better sense over all of the sector is $66 million. I lost. What did we learn there? Well, yeah, the $66 million loss you refer to as an accounting loss. We refer to the Justin EBITDA numbers were kind of right in line with our estimates. $13.5 million EBITDA, a lot of one time things in the quarter, though, was the $42 million dollar burn. I don't think we learned a lot. We know Canada is a difficult market that's weighing on their, on their profits. Even though even as they reduce their cost and try to increase their market share. It's one thing we learned. They did reiterate their EBITDA guidance for the year. I would argue with FX. They actually, the guidance is actually higher and a little bit difficult. That was encouraging. They also read their free cash flow guidance. When say we learned anything today, Canada is a difficult market. They and until raise probably as we've written, we believe that of the companies trying to go after a leading market share and position. In market share position in Canada and trying to leverage that for kind of a global state. They're probably in the best position, but you can't get away from the fact that Canada is a very difficult market and that's going to be expensive to do. Yeah, at this point more cautionary tales than success stories in Canada. It's a stifle analyst, Andrew Carter. Good to see you. Thanks. Hey, thanks for having me. Jonathan. Another hot button issue ahead of the midterms. A student loan forgiveness. The website allowing people to register is set to go alive soon. But the White House's plan is facing opposition. Joining us now we want to bring in Yahoo Finance editor in chief Andy Soror. And you recently sat down with Education Secretary Miguel. Cardona talking to him about this. What did he say about the plan? Well, he's in defense mode right now because as you said, Shana, the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,91,2022-10-07 20:25:49
2875," Education Secretary Miguel Cardona talking to him about this. What did he say about the plan? Well, he's in defense mode right now because as you said, Sean, the plan is out. It was announced in late August, but opposition is beginning to mount and coalesce from various sides. And we'll talk a little bit about that. But he basically preempted this notion that it's a handout by saying that if you're going to criticize this plan, why are you not criticizing the PPP bailout? And why are you not criticizing tax cuts? In other words, it's always the case that the government is giving to some groups and not to others. So I think that was at least one argument he was making. Also, we spoke to Ayanna Presley, a member of the squad, a representative from Massachusetts. And she was saying that, look, this is something we need to do if we want to help Americans get a better shake from our society. So the left, her and AOC and others are more or less on board with a Biden plan, even though they wanted more at one point. To the notion that these others, I mean, two wrongs don't make a right is what our parents told us. Right? So I get pushed back on that notion. But as for the opposite, and we've got secretaries of state lining up with lawsuits, how significant is the Republican opposition to it? Well, it's significant, Dave. And we talked to Kevin Breedy, a representative from Texas. And he basically said it's inflationary. It's irresponsible. But most of all, it is unfair. And he went on, said the plumber doesn't get one. But the guy whose house he's fixing does get one and so forth. There are a number of lawsuits. And I think those six AGs from those red states, that is a significant thing. There are also a number of private lawsuits from groups in California and Wisconsin as well. And there's some that suggests that, and Ben Worshkel wrote about this, our colleague, saying that if it goes into the course and gets to the Supreme Court, it would get voted down. Some question, the constitutionality of whether Biden has actually the right to be able to do this plan. So it's a unique question on the campaign trail. But he said, I don't have the authority. Now that I'm in the seat, different thing. Yeah. Yeah. Now, obviously, student debt forgiveness is just a piece of it. But, and isn't there really much more beyond this that needs to be addressed? Yeah, that's right, Worshkel. I mean, it's a big stew. It's a big mess. And Sheila Baer, former head of the FDIC, who was president of Washington College, by the way. So this is kind of in her wheelhouse, said really that the whole thing's a big mess. And Baer said, listen, I'm a Republican. I voted for Biden. I am for some student forgiveness, but only $10,000 to the Pell Grant recipients. Not this bigger pot, not this bigger pool. And really she talks about how colleges and universities, the tuition costs, I've been exceeding inflation, the system is very opaque. It's very complex. Bar-oars don't know what they're getting into. And so to just do a bailout right here is something that is just taking one tiny little slice. And of course, we're getting towards midterms, you guys. So there's that factored in as well. And others point to the fact that this could be inflationary. Sheila Baer is saying, if we're going into recession, let's help people who are unemployed, not necessarily this group of individuals. So as you can see, just a ton of swirl around this. And it'll be interesting to see when it rolls out. And if and when it actually is going to happen even at this point. Can't wait to read your piece. The boss. Yeah. Heather and Chief Andy Server, thank you. Have a good weekend, sir. Thanks, you guys. All right, coming up, retired poker champion.

2876," 100 meters over The great resignation may have given way to quiet quitting in the eyes of social media, but those actually quitting remain strong in number 4.2 million. Quit their jobs in August as the number remains historically high. Duke literally wrote the book on this subject, quit the power of knowing when to walk away. She joined us now and he nice to see you. So when is quitting a good thing? And did you learn this from your days at the professional poker table? Yeah, I mean, I think I definitely learned this lesson from poker. So when quitting isn't a good thing, is when the thing you're doing is no longer worthwhile, either on its own or in comparison to other things that you might do with that time instead. So this is a concept that's really important to understand in poker. You have this option to fold, which means to quit the hand. And you do that when the hand is no longer going to have a positive return on investment, at least in your sort of forecast. And that allows you to keep those chips to be able to invest in other hands that would have a positive return. And this skill for poker players is so important that I think it's actually the thing that distinguishes great players from merely good ones. Great players fold somewhere between 75 and 85% of their two cards starting cards, hands and amateurs fold less than 50% of them. So this is a big distinction between great and good. And it's interesting because quitting used to be associated with failing, but you say that's not the right way to look at it. How do you equate that with success? Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say it used to be associated with failing. I would say it is associated with failing. I mean, if I called you a quitter, I'd be insulting you, right? So I'd be calling you a loser or something like that. The reason why it's such a key skill that we really need to get good at is because there's all these cognitive biases that stack the deck against us actually stopping things when we ought to. So we have the intuition that when we get involved in something, when we start something, we find out new information that will actually stop doing it when that information is bad, when it's a negative signal. But we actually don't, right? We will often double down, we'll increase our commitment to the cause. And the problem with that is it costs us a lot because it means that we're spending our time and our resources, our money on things that really aren't worth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,93,2022-10-07 20:34:28
2877," crease our commitment to the cause. And the problem with that is it costs us a lot because it means that we're spending our time and our resources are money on things that really aren't worth doing. And we want to be able to switch that to things that are because there's just huge opportunity costs to it's sticking to something that isn't worthwhile. And that's true whether it's a stock that you've bought that you bought at 50 and now it's at 40 and even though you wouldn't buy it today, you stick with it because you don't want to have to turn that loss on paper into a realized loss. And so you kind of keep the bet on hoping you can get the money back. And think what that's doing to you because you can't take that money and put it into an investment that might be worth more like better for your money. I love the analogy. I understand it. Annie, I just don't play poker. My son does. And I'm trying to teach my son you need grit. Grit will carry you through the tough times. Is there a danger in emphasizing quit over grit? I don't think I think there's a danger in emphasizing one or the other. In other words, thinking that being gritty is heroic and you know quitting is cowardice or advice versus all of a sudden saying that we should just quit things willing. I mean, the great thing about grit is it gets you to stick to hard things that are worthwhile. In other words, those worthwhile things where you encounter obstacles grit is going to allow you to sort of stick to it regardless, right? The problem is that it also gets us to stick to hard things that aren't worthwhile. So like a good example is there's this woman, Shavano Keith, who in the 2019 London marathon started experiencing pain online on mile four in her leg. And then mile eight, she had snapped her fibula bone so she literally broke her leg. But she kept running because anything sort of the finish line is failure. And so the problem is like we need to make sure these are finish lines that we should still continue to run toward. And in this particular case, she was risking very, very serious injury that could have made it so that she could never run again. Now, let's you think she's a strange story. There were three other people who did the same thing in that same marathon. And this happens in every marathon. And so when we emphasize grit and we sort of elevated above anything else, we can start climbing mountains and snowstorms when we shouldn't be or running marathons with broken legs or staying in a job with a toxic boss or sticking with an investment where the world has completely gone against your thesis just because you don't want to give it up. And you feel like you need to stick to it. I mean, and it really is true because it's so engraved in us to try and stick with things even when they aren't serving us. And it's interesting because the stats in your book, the pros play fewer than 25% of their hands before the other cards even hit the table. And most amateurs, you have it play about about 50%. And so when people are trying to think of how they can really master some of these skills and their instincts, how should they go about it? Yeah, so there's two main strategies for dealing with this because we really do need to understand that like cognitively, we have a huge bias against quitting. I think most of your listeners are probably familiar with the sunk cost fallacy that we take into account what we've already lost in trying to decide whether to continue. So that's a bias against stopping. So given that we're not going to be very good at deciding to stop once we started to accumulate those losses, like if the stock is already trading at 40 when we bought it at 50, there's two strategies. One is think ahead. So a simple example of think ahead would be a stop loss or even a take gain. These are ways that we can think ahead to what are the conditions under which we would let this particular endeavor go or this investment that we have go. The other thing you can do is get what I call a quitting coach. So like Rochelle, I mean, I assume that you've seen people who are sticking to things and from the outside looking in, it's very obvious that they should be quitting them, but they're not. And if we assume that that's true, then we can realize that that probably happens to us as well. So why not recruit those people who can see it better than you can because they're on the outside looking in and get them to help you with these decisions? I mean, it's kind of what a financial advisor is, right? They're trying to coach you. When is it right to stick to it? And when is it right to walk away? Because they understand that we're not going to be very good at making those decisions ourselves. Yes, true. Sometimes when you're too close to a situation, you can't see the forest for the trees. It's been great having you on. And you do. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful afternoon. Thank you. Or shift.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,94,2022-10-07 20:38:26
2878," When you're too close to a situation, you can't see the forest with the trees. It's been great having you on. And you do. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful afternoon. Thank you. Well, shift. Good to have you now. Shifting is now to meta, which has begun notifying Facebook users that may have had their accounts compromised by third party apps. Yeah, the finances, Alie Garfingle has the latest on this. Alie, what do we need to know? Great to see you, Rachelle. So meta's been notifying 1 million Facebook users that they've been affected by these malware apps that on the face of it, look, look pretty harmless. They're often photo editors, lifestyle trackers, that sort of thing. But what meta's found is that they're available both on the Apple App Store and on the Google App Store. So they have put this forth to their users and they are now bringing it to both Apple and Google. So this is kind of coming at a time for lots of controversy for app stores, right? You have a lot of controversy surrounding how apps or fees are structured. You have a lot of controversy surrounding Apple's privacy changes that came last year, which by the way, really hit meta's bottom line hard. My take on this sort of Rachelle is that after years of being known for their privacy failures, meta's trying to show that they're turning a corner here being proactive protecting users data. And of course meta known, but when it switched this name all about the metaverse, but their flagship metaverse app Horizon Worlds has been called bug riddles by employees according to a report from the Virgis. So much that in fact, that employees aren't actually using it. How big of a problem could this be the meta? Well, it's a really big problem, right, Rachelle? It's their big bet. It's what they changed the name of the company, what they really hung out their shingle on. And you know, it's interesting. So many experts I talked to are bullish on the metaverse, but I've questions about meta's ability to lead an uncharted territory. I got a, I got a statement from meta. I was in communication with them this morning and what they said to me was, were confident that the metaverse is the future of computing and should be built around people. This is a multi-er journey and we're going to keep making what we build better. So they're pushing forth. There's no question that they keep going here. I think the question is, if they can push through and become true leaders in this space, if they can get through these bugs, if they can get to the place where Horizon Worlds is indispensable in the metaverse. And as they mentioned that, a multi-year plan, so we'll be keeping an eye on that. Ali, go through it. It's always good to see you have a great weekend, Dave. Thank you, Rachelle. Here's a look now at what to watch for next week. Monday is Indigenous Peoples Day, but markets are open on Tuesday. We're going to read on small business sentiment from the National Federation of Independent Business. And it's the start of Amazon's October Prime Day sale, which is a two-day event. On the economic front Wednesday, we'll get the producer price index and the Fed minutes as well. Earning start to trickle in with PepsiCo reporting ahead of the open on Thursday. We've got to look at inflation with the consumer price index and boys of Fed watching that. Weekly jobless claims plus quarterly results from BlackRock, Delta, and Walgreens. And we route out the week with the unofficial start to earnings. Season with bank earnings. We'll hear from JP Morgan, city group Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, as for some economic data, retail sales and consumer sentiment are out big week. Coming up, Kickstarter named its new CEO just over a week and Goey tells us about his plans for the crowdfunding company. Next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,95,2022-10-07 20:42:59
2879," Laughter Let's take a look at some of the biggest movers of the week investors have been on quite a roll of coaster ride here. So let's kick it off with some of the biggest moves that we've seen play out in the markets. Let's start with the chip stocks because it has been a rude awakening for investors. To thought that the sector may have bottom signs of slowing demand and supply chain issues have some worried about a prolonged downturn. You can see the semiconductor index moving to the downside here on the five day chart. Samsung reported a 32% dive in operating income AMD. Lord, it's revenue guidance for the third quarter. That was enough to drag down some of its competitors. Intel and Nvidia both moving to the downside. You can see the move over the last 48 hours or so. So part of this, a regulations from the Biden administration, clumping down on China's access to chip technology with new export rules AMD dropping 14% today. The biggest drop that we have seen in this stock since March 2020 closing the week at 5844. Next up, let's talk about Twitter this stock up just about 12% over the past five days. I'm reviving chance of Elon Musk's takeover, but this deal is very far from being over. They now seem to have stalled and part over a debt financing contingency. This is according to reports yesterday, a Delaware judge granted musks a requested delay his trial with Twitter, giving both sides until October 28 to complete the deal over the past five days. You can see it up just about 12% closing at 4918. So below that deal price that musk is what initially wanted to pay for Twitter at 5420 a share. Let's talk about oil recording the biggest weekly rally that we have seen since March as worries over supply offset some of those demand concerns on the supply side. OPEC plus announcing its biggest output cut since the start of the pandemic. The move coming ahead of the impending European sanctions on Russian oil imports. It's a massive reversal from what we've seen, and crude as of late over the past three months. You can see crude off just over 10% coming off the worst quarter that we have seen since 2020, but really rallying on the news that we got this week. It's rounded out with peloton, the sucks therging more than 20% to big announcements. We start off the week with the partnership with Hilton, and then we heard about another round of cut CEO Larry Barry McCarthy announcing plans to cut about 12% of the workforce. It's fourth round of layoffs this year saying, quote, he needs to do it to save the company. One of the ways that they're trying to save the company and increase business is through a new partnerships agreement with Hilton will put its bikes in 5400 Hilton owned hotels throughout the US. You can see peloton moving to the upside for the past five days up just around 25% you can see it did close the day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,96,2022-10-07 20:47:12
2880," Owned hotels throughout the US. You can see Peloton moving to the upside for the past five days. Up just around 25 percent. You can see it did close the day in negative territory. But for the week, closing at $8.69 a share. Michelle? All right. So what I was speaking of fresh ideas, equity crowdfunding is seeing continued growth as access to venture capital dollars becomes more and more scarce. Now, according to crowdfunding tracker Aurora Project, startups already raised more than $200 million this year. We're joining us now as an expert in crowdfunding and a new CEO of Kickstarter, Everett Taylor, Everett Gray to have you on the show. So, fresh in the job here. First off, what made you decide to take it and what sort of changes or developments are you hoping that you're going to kick off here at Kickstarter? Well, thank you first for having me. It's an honor to be here. And it was really exciting time to come to Kickstarter, right? Especially in this current macroeconomic environment where access to capital is more difficult than ever. And a lot of people that are starting new things may not fit for the traditional venture capitalists or traditional investor. And so for me, I feel very aligned with the mission of Kickstarter. I, from one of them, from South Cybers, Virginia, where I didn't have a lot of resources growing up. So to be able to be at a platform to help people's dreams come true and bring beautiful things into the world and impact so many lives, it was a no-brainer. Everett, what are you seeing just in terms of people starting businesses right now, especially in this current state of the downturn that we're seeing in the economy? So many people worried about inflation, higher prices. Is that affecting the number of people that are looking to start with their business right now? I think so. I think a lot of people are fearful of the macroeconomic environment. And you see it from big companies to small entrepreneurs that want to launch their own companies. And I think what was so exciting about coming to Kickstarter, it provides a way for people to be able to find capital for the ideas that they have. And things that may not be big businesses, like venture capitalists tend to want to have huge returns and most businesses aren't that way. And so I think it's incredible to be at a platform that can help so many entrepreneurs during a time of so much uncertainty and be able to provide them a viable way to really bring that into life. And Everett, looking at some of the companies on the screen, the Oculus and Pebble that actually started out on Kickstarter, I still remember where Kickstarter was first time to come. People were getting bids on being able to make a grilled cheese sandwich or a potato salad. But obviously, as you see these different companies advance, what do you think the evolution is going to be next? You have things like blockchain and other elements coming into play. How do you see the company evolving to some of these new technologies that are coming out? You know, it's interesting even when I was listening before, I saw you guys talking about Peloton. Peloton was even started on Kickstarter. So a lot of really, you know, technologically forward companies have started on Kickstarter. So I think we're going to embrace that. I think we're going to embrace the evolution of the world around us. And I'm really open to new types of companies, new types of projects. And I'm coming into this crowdfunding industry with a very open mind. I just really want to be able to see people bring the things that they want to into life. And have a viable platform to do so. But I think we're going to be extremely supportive of new technologies and new things that are happening around the world. Everton, in terms of your business right now, hiring plans, how you see Kickstarter growing over the years, what does that look like? And are you able to get the number of workers that you need for Kickstarter? Oh, I think so. I think what's so interesting about Kickstarter and it's exciting. Allow me to brag and flex for a second is that Kickstarter has a really great balance sheet right now. We're profitable the past couple of years in the pandemic. We're our best years yet. We actually grew 30% during the pandemic, which is a lot for such an established company. And so I think we're in a great place to aggressively hire, but it do so in the right ways. I think what we've seen in this macro economic environment is that so many companies were a little bit careless when it came to hiring and overhiring and bloated salaries and things like that. So we've been very intentional. That's why I want to continue to be intentional, but I want us to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,97,2022-10-07 20:51:29
2881," and overhiring and bloated salaries and things like that. So we've been very intentional thus far. And I want to continue to be intentional, but I want us to see a lot more massive growth. Crowdfunding has so much potential. And I want to continue to grow the industry to support more people, especially diverse creators out there and then also welcoming more Gen Z creators as well. And everyone, as people look for transparency and what their funding and wins for these things come into fruition, what sort of investments are you making in that space to really make their place where people know exactly what they're sort of getting into with these sort of projects? Yeah, pledge management is a huge component about Kickstarter. Obviously Kickstarter is a dominant player in the space in terms of driving that demand to get to that point. But then what happens after? And that's where pledge management comes into. And so I think Kickstarter will definitely be looking into that and figuring out ways that we can make our creators more successful is because if we're helping our creators be more successful and helping with their fulfillment, then the backers on our platform are gonna have a lot better experiences. And so that is a key priority for me. All right, Everett Taylor, great to have you. Kickstarter, CEO, we wish you all the best. We hope you come back and join us again on Yoll and Finance. Well, coming up the Super Mario Brothers movie doesn't come out until next April, but fans are getting an early glimpse into what's ahead. But it's not without from controversy. We've got that for you when we come back. county. During one of its Nintendo Direct Streams this week, the Japanese gaming giant unveiled the first trailer for its much-anticipated the Super Mario Bros. movie. The animated film features the Brooklyn plumber brothers as they battle Bowser across the mushroom kingdom, featuring a star-studded cast with Chris Pratt voicing Mario Fuk the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDK8QAnFNxU,98,2022-10-07 20:56:05
2882," It shows the Brooklyn plumber brothers as they battle Bowser across the mushroom kingdom featuring a star-studded cast with Chris Pratt voicing Mario controversially and Charlie Day playing Luigi Anatella Joy joins as Princess Peach, Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong, Keegan Michael Key as Toad and Jack Black plays the fire-breathing Bowser. It's the first Mario Brothers movie since 1993's live action film starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguzzama and it's scheduled to hit theaters April 7, 2023 and there was massive controversy as soon as this trailer hit because nobody, Rachelle, liked the voice that Chris Pratt brought to Mario, somewhat reminiscent of what happened with Sonic the movie when they were offended by the sight of Sonic and they tweaked it, but this was pretty much universally panned. But I do feel a bit bad for Chris Pratt. You don't want to get this sort of feedback, especially since when you heard Jack Black voicing Bowser, which is perfect, it was absolutely perfectly cast for that voice acting. It's hard, won't you get so used to seeing Chris Pratt one role? That voice is very hard, you'd associate it with something else. I do feel a bit bad, but yes, the voice doesn't quite match. I'm still going to watch the movie though, I'm a big Super Mario fan, been playing it since I was a little girl, so I'm still going to watch it. You know, I read about the feedback of his voice and then when I listened to it, I didn't think it was as bad as some critics are making it out to be. It doesn't really, I guess, totally match up, but it's not terrible. I don't know, I'm going to go out and go ahead and say that, but I will say, it does surprise me how much hype there is for a film like this. I used to play this game when I was nine, ten years old. I don't think I'm going to go and watch this. So the fact that there's this much attention on it, it's making this much news, it's attracting huge names to do the movie, that's a little bit of a surprise to me. I am done with the movie category film from video games and I think we would be done if it weren't for Sonic, but it made 300 million of the box office. I know, and then Sonic too made more than 400 million of the box office, so this is just the beginning. We're going to see video game movies and a stream of pipeline, especially with all the streamers and the lack of original content out there. I would just surprise, we're show by the casting. I love Chris Pratt. I'm not one of those that thinks he's a divisive figure, although he truly is in Hollywood. I mean, guarding the galaxy's aunt standing, but how about Joe Pesci or Roberto Benini or Joe Pesci? I don't know, Steve Buscemi. Someone, Chris Pratt, close your eyes does not seem to me like an Italian plumber. I mean, I don't know exactly how you categorize an Italian plumber's voice, but yeah. Chris Pratt, it's a little quite matching. Charlie, Charlie Daydough as Luigi. I love it, but I also love Charlie Daydough. I'm a little bit biased because I just think his voice is fantastic. I actually liked his voice as Luigi. Will you see it, though? Because we've got two languages. No, I'm going to see it. I'm going to see it. One for three is not bad. One for three is not bad, isn't it? No, probably not the demo. We're all going to say it. Yeah, I don't think it's really shocked at anyone that I won't be heading to the theaters to watch this, but never say never, I guess. No. Leave it at that. Renter. I think it'll be something fun. All streaming. There you go. Well, that will do it for all of us. For today's edition of Young Quiet Air Slime, be sure to come back Monday, though, at 3pm Eastern for all of your coverage leading up to and off to the closing bell.

2887," We've heard a lot of chatter about whether or not capacity will exceed demand in the near term. How would you be monitoring the electric vehicle space and especially given some of the not just newer companies but legacy companies that have made swift movements into trying to make sure that they can bring up some of that production capacity in order to meet kind of this next wave of where the consumer is moving towards in a cleaner type of automotive offering on the market. Yeah, I mean, it's a challenge. You look at a lot of different electric vehicles and you simply can't buy them right now. The F-150 Lightning, the Tesla Model 3 long range until recently massively back-ordered. The reality is that demand can move faster than supply. Supply chains from lithium production to battery production can take years to really ramp up scale. Whereas a consumer can change their mind overnight. Let's say, you know, just ride an electric car for the first time. So absolutely we have a supply and demand a balance right now. But we are seeing so much investment from car manufacturers again from the US government and the $370 billion inflation reduction act. So there's a lot of money coming into this space, but it might take a few years to see that capacity increase. Jay, thanks for being with us. Good to see you. Black Rocks, the US head of the Maddick and active equity ETFs, Jay Jacobs. Well, come up next. What investors should be watching this month? So I was going to share his top three things to be bracing yourself for right now.... You September was the worst month for stocks since March of 2020 and October may not be much better. Right? Three reasons why your money is at risk this month. At pessimism, if we refine your take, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, folks.

2888," This this month, pessimism is where we find your take. Thanks a lot, folks. I'm a hell out of folks, but just to use a term for our friend, Joe Berswellas, on Friday, I think investors have just been pulling from the Hopium pipe a little too much here, especially after that rally to kick off this quarter. A couple of reasons why I think investors need to be a little more concerned about the markets going in the back half of the year, or back half of the month, full story on this, on the Alphine's homepage, first inflation data. Well, we're going to get the CPI and PPI this week, in addition to some inflation expectation data from the Michigan consumer sentiment. The problem is none of this data is really supposed to slow or show marked deceleration month over month. A lot of the economists on the street are looking for really the core CPI, which the market will be very focused on and try to extrapolate what that means to Fed policy. That may not slow month over month over month over month. If we get another hot read, like we saw in the jobs report last week, you could very easily see another ugly market reaction, just one guy's thoughts there. Next up, the raw earnings numbers. We've seen previews so far from AMD, micron, Nike, FedEx. They've all been bad quarters. They've all been really bad forward outlook. In fact, FedEx just flat out pulled its outlook because of various inflation. Look, you can't even look at so ugly. Can't even look at so ugly. Yeah, wow, I didn't, yeah, put on the Yahoo purple blindfold. But you look at the raw numbers, excluding the energy sector. Goldman notes, earnings are expected to fall by 3%. And margins are supposed to decline about 140 basis points year by year into third quarter. Real big shift in tone compared to the first half of this year. And then also, of course, last year, hence, you're seeing margins come down. But a big concern. Last but not least, here, just the tone on these executive earnings calls. It's going to be hard to find really any team that's willing to come up here and set the bar high into a fourth quarter where you might still see a strong dollar in the impact on sales and profits, lingering inflation, problems getting workers, you name it. The tone on these calls could be very down beat. And you might see the stocks get hit as a result. Last but not least, here comes some whiplash. That's my take. I think there's been a little calm. That is, wow, that's really aggressive. Do I have an eyes? Well, that's aggressive. But nonetheless, there's been a little calm that has come to the market. We're seeing it today. Saw it a little bit before the Jaws of Por on Friday. But just be careful here. There's some, this earnings is going to be a lot rockier than I think a lot of folks are bracing. So clearly based on their graphic, move over laser eyes that we saw last year in 2021, here come the dizzy eyes. Yes, honoree, your pillow and hope for better days. Well, as always. I know you're taking the other sides. You're looking for earnings beats today. No, well, there will be earnings beats. Come on, they're always our earnings beats. It's about outlook, bubble block. But it matters what your investment horizon is. As always, if you're retiring next year, you may have a problem. If you're looking like J. Jacobs a little bit further in the future, maybe you don't freak out. Five to 10 years from now, taxes will be hard to be a big earnings headline. I'm just really in. Yeah, it's not going to work. The larger question is, how soon will markets fully price in the biggest risks of a recession perhaps? And because they typically priced that in months ahead of time, what does that actually look like in terms of setting in a bottom and when do we bounce off of that? And we're about to find out. Yeah, guys, come here. Why are next guests says that it's likely the Fed will stay hawkish for the foreseeable future? That's not good. For that bottoming out. I was just going to start on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,2,2022-10-10 14:02:48
2889," to Welcome back to Yow Finance on this Monday morning on Brian Saas, alongside Julie Heimann and Brad Smith. Markets or mix, this trader's gear up from important reads on inflation this week and the start of earning season with results out of the big banks. You're seeing some mixed action across the board, the Dow slightly in the green. Now here are three things we're watching for you at this moment. On high alert for a recession, we'll talk one economic expert on the road ahead for the sputtering U.S. economy. And DC heats up. Yow Finance contributor Kevin Surley stops by ahead of the annual World Bank and IMF meetings later this week. And a key great recession player wins some new hardware for his trophy shelf. We'll have the details coming up shortly. Now let's get over to Yow Finance as an S for A over at the Wi-Fi Interactive. And Saas, we are looking at a mixed picture when it comes to equities. The bond market today is closed. But the NASDAQ is the one that is really underperforming right now, down 6.10% of a percent. That's because technology stocks are under pressure so you can see tech here under pressure, healthcare and consumer discretionary as well. Over on the NASDAQ on 100, we are watching a little bit of flatness when it comes to Amazon, Tesla, up about 7.10% of a percent. And Apple, down about 1%. Do you want to point out what's happening with the Chinese ADRs? Because we are seeing some of these Chinese ADRs under pressure. And this is because of some holiday shopping data also because of COVID cases in China. So that's putting pressure on these Chinese stocks. And also putting pressure on some of the gambling stocks as well. So just looking at our gambling chart, we are seeing some of these casinos and win resorts that are under pressure as well as some of the travel stocks guys. Alright, Yow Finance is on the NASDAQ. Thanks for breaking that down for us. Appreciate it. And as we continue to look ahead to what's on tap this week with the Fed Minutes and CPI data, let's bring in the co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, Loxman to Truth and to break it down. Loxman always a pleasure to speak with you and get some of your insights. Help us tee up this week. I mean, we've got a ton of data, of course. Last week was the big kind of employment reading across the board from private payrolls all the way into some of the Joltz data that we had seen, even though that's lagging a little bit more. And of course, the Monthly Jobs report. What is that setup for what the Fed is also going to be tracking on pricing more broadly this week and what consumers are actually paying? Great question. And thank you for having me. Good morning. Jobs data, CPI data this week, Jobs data last Friday, CPI data this week. Those are all what we would call from a cyclical kind of monitoring point of view, coincident data. And the Fed has declared for many years, kind of what got us into the.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,3,2022-10-10 14:06:51
2890," So, all what we would call from a cyclical kind of monitoring point of view, coincident data. And the Fed has declared for many years, it's kind of what got us into this pickle in the first place that they're going to be tracking coincident data in order to figure out what to do. And every once in a while, you'll hear that their data dependent. And that's a little bit of an eye into that view. And so we look at the jobs data. Yeah, it was a pretty good report on the face of it. Your year of a year job growth actually is trending down. It's about a year and a half low in the growth rate. So cyclically, we know this direction we're going in, but the jobless rate at a half century low, three and a half percent on the face of it, that's hawkish, more hawkish Fed. It's not what they want to see at this point. They need more weakness in the labor market and they've said that in various ways. And then when you look to the CPI, coincident inflation data this week, probably too sticky, probably too hot. Our cyclical view, right, forward looking cyclical view, is that actually the peak is in, right? And a cyclical peak has already happened in inflation. We are trending down. The problem is that it's going to be very sticky. You might get some relief in the pace of goods related inflation, but the services side where most of the spending happens, including rents, for example, very, very sticky. And as a result, I in the earlier segment, the point was made that, you know, core is going to be sticky. They're looking at core coincident inflation. So again, kind of a hawkish, you know, angle to the Fed, trying to make up for the earlier mistake of missing the inflation cycle upturn, continuing to slow the economy. So Lakshman, you talked about where we are in the inflation cycle. What about where we are in the overall economic cycle, right? Because what we've been hearing from guests as of late is the tenor has started to shift a little bit from being pretty darn confident that it was going to be a mild recession if we get one to maybe leaning a little bit more into, well, maybe it's going to be a little bit more severe than we thought. Thanks. Excellent question. And I, this is how we edge into the realization that, yes, there's a recession. And markets are, and analysts can be kind of manic depressive, right? So they'll be like, no, it's not happening in all of a sudden as it becomes more obvious that something's a foot, they can overdo it and get more extreme the other side. Our analysis is that, yes, there is going to be a recession. To be clear, we will need to see job losses for there to be a recession. Also, to be clear, there have been several instances historically where recessions begin before job losses begin. One of the more extreme examples would be the 73, 75 recession, which was a very severe recession, which began and then jobs actually kept growing for eight months until you actually saw jobs to start negative. So the recession itself began a little bit earlier. This is getting into the weeds about how recessions are determined. And we may be seeing some of that here because it was so hard to find the people that you needed to work that businesses are very reluctant to let them go. Even when they're starting to see difficulty on earnings and you were saying in the earlier segment also I was watching about how this earnings kind of recession feeling is coming in. And FedEx, for example, it's just like, forget it, we can't even say anything. It's a global recession and we don't know what's going to happen. And global recessions to be fair, they are more severe than your kind of garden variety recession. So I think that's a reasonable thing to be thinking about in your scenario planning. Do you think the economy next year will start shedding jobs like you mentioned? Yes, look, if we're right and there's a recession and I think that we are correct here, then by definition there must be job losses. The question will be how much structurally there's a lot of issues in tightness in the labor market so that may limit it to some degree. We have seen as I mentioned in that inflationary kind of 70s period where the nominal numbers look pretty good. The businesses were slow to let people go. I mean, it's very, very expensive to hire someone and then let them go. You have to train them up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,4,2022-10-10 14:11:07
2891," slow to let people go. I mean, it's very, very expensive to hire someone and then let them go. You have to train them up and then you have to let them go. That's the last thing you want to do as a business manager. So I understand why that is and they're hopeful. Certainly you see all the time. There's a lot of hope in you use that. I was watching everything this morning. You're using the hope in order this morning. And there's a lot of this this comes up in them in the market talk. Oh, maybe they're going to pivot. Maybe they're going to be able to sell. I don't think that's going to happen. But that kind of talk probably is is keeping some of the jobs growth going to. Um, Lex, man, how does the Fed then react to all of this? Right? There is the talk of pivot has faded away a little bit. Yeah. But at some point, do we see the Fed sort of quickly trying to backpedal here and fix some of the economic damage that it looks like that the policy could cause? Yeah. I mean, I think that we wrote at the beginning of the year in January. We wrote that there's that they had a choice of two mistakes. Right? And meaning that they either had to take a recession or they had to let inflation run out of control. I'm being overly simplistic and they've chosen the recession. So the intention is the pain that is the goal. And I think Powell said as much in one of the Q and A things a week or two ago. And and so will they go too far? I mean, in the sense that there'll be a recession. I think yes. Uh, and they, I think believe that they have the tools to counterman that at some point and and and ease up on the on the typing. But by their own definition, they're saying that they want to see the pace of core. CPI growth, depending on various measures of looking at it, drop down. And by all the analysis and the now casting that we're hearing, this week's CPI is still going to be sticky. And and we think we understand why it's probably more in the services side that it'll be sticky. But the Fed is saying if it's sticky, we're going to stay the course. And that's not what the market wants to hear. So we probably have this slower grinding. And again, you, you had mentioned earlier. It's tempting because prices are down to start to look for bargains longer term bargains. But you're going to have to accept a lot of volatility because this chapter isn't over yet. Okay. So with that in mind and also given that you've studied previous economic cycles, we know that the markets try to price in the risk of a recession well ahead of time. But what would that bottom bottom out period look like in relative to now relative to the declines that we've already seen over the course of 2022. And when might we see that bottom? Hard to say magnitude wise, right? So if it's a global recession and the odds are high, I think of that, it could be more severe. So the recognition of that may be mean some more downside volatility. The question of then is where else do you put your money in? It's and it's hard to figure that out. So there's a lot of maybe this isn't the worst place even though it's going down. These bigger recessions, you could see larger retransments in equity prices than we've seen so far. So that's totally in the cards. The relationship between equities and business cycles, business cycle recessions is that they do tend to sniff out the recovery before the bottom of the recession by a few months. And I have no reason to believe this cycle wouldn't be different. Looking at other leading indicators of non equity related leading indicators, it doesn't look like the bottom is in sight yet. And so that's why we were very suspicious of the soft landing bottoming narrative that developed a few months ago. So I think that the S&P was like in 3600 right around there at 3660 and it was like, that's it. We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. We could see across the valley. And of course that was premature. I think we have another light down here. It sounds like that is indeed what we.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,5,2022-10-10 14:15:21
2892," I think we have another leg down here. It sounds like. That is indeed what we call a head fake. Lachman, at your time. Economics, cycle, research, institute, co-founder. Always good to see you. Have a good rest of the week. Nice to see you too. Thank you. All right, before we head to break, let's highlight some cautious analysis on IBM. By Marcus down these Eric Woodring, head of its October 19th earnings report, notably Woodring expects IBM to miss consensus margin estimates says Woodring in a note to clients. We see downside two street margins and reduce our margin estimates as we expect cost pressures to persist in 3Q. Most of those margin pressures are seen coming from IBM's consulting and infrastructure businesses. Coming up, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke is a big winner today, Julie is back with today's top headlines next. All right, I'm going to let you know Here are some of the other headlines that we are watching at this hour, at least 11 or 60 injured in Ukraine this morning. After Russia launched its biggest widespread assault on the country since the start of its invasion, this comes after Vladimir Putin accused the country of attacking a critical bridge to Crimea and promised a harsh response if Kiev were to conduct further terrorist attacks, his words on Russian territory. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says Russia wants, quote, panic and chaos, he cited attacks on the country's electrical grid and other civilian infrastructure. Former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke and two other US economists, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dibvig, were recognized by the Nobel, Nobel panel at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today. The three economists sharing the Nobel Prize for their research into the fallout from bank failures. The panel said the trio's research, quote, significantly improved the understanding of the role of banks and why avoiding bank lapses is vital. Credit Tweet shares extend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,6,2022-10-10 14:20:02
2893," The trio's research quote significantly improved the understanding of the role of banks, and why avoiding bank lapses is vital. Credit Tweet shares extended their rally to a third day after Bloomberg reported that bidders are lining up for the bank's Securitized Products Unit. That's a key pillar in the downsizing of its investment banking operations. A sale of that unit could prove an additional catalyst for the bank, which recently offered to buy back up to $3 billion of its own debt. It's a busy week down in DC highlighted by the annual IMF and World Bank meetings. The Alphine's contributor, Kevin Surley, has some analysis for us on these events. Kevin, what's on your radar screen? T minus 30 days until the midterm elections, and this week we're going to get two crucial debates that really could be indicative not just of what's happening in Ohio and in Georgia, but the broader country as a whole. In Ohio, the late night senate, J.D. Vance, the Maga Republican, challenging former Democratic congressman Tim Ryan. Remember, he ran for president last cycle as well. This is a debate that is going to be the first of two for them leading up to the midterm elections, but let's not forget that early voting has started in multiple states. And now it is when voters are going to be paying more careful attention. And then of course down in Georgia, Rafael Warnock, the Democrat Governor incumbent, challenging being challenged rather by Herschel Walker. Now he of course has been played by a series of allegations that he denies a chief among them that he advocated for his former girlfriend to have an abortion. Walker has made being anti-abortion part of his platform. So this is really the first time and potentially the last time where these two politicians and the Georgia governor race will come face to face. And mind you, this comes at a time when abortion has risen to the top of the polls as to what Democrats are paying attention to. But this debate really could reverberate outside of Georgia. A lot of folks paying attention to what's going on there. Yeah, indeed, a lot of eyes on that state and the race there, Kevin. Also, we got to talk about jobs and how the recent jobs report that impacts Thursday's inflation print as well. Well, precisely, and not just what happened with the jobs report, record low unemployment rate, 50-year low, 3.5%. But juxtaposed with what happened with OPEC, that has many economists worried that inflation in the United States might continue to rise as consumers face more pain at the pump. But while abortion has risen to the top of issues that Democrats are paying a careful attention to, amongst independent voters and Republicans, it's all about the economy. And that's why the inflation report coming on Thursday, the final report ahead of the midterm elections will be so incredibly crucial and carefully watched. This is been something of an economy, rather, that both parties that strive to seize upon, Democrats saying that there's record low unemployment. But of course, Republicans looking at inflation and saying that it's a sign that we're heading even further into a recession. And then finally, you're watching the January 6th Committee. And this, I guess, also has implications going back to the first item you're watching the midterms potentially. When can we look for the January 6th Committee's report? Nobody knows, Jules. I mean, that's what I've been and truthfully, though, I mean, I'll be honest, I was just, you know, talking to folks yesterday, and, and Julie, that's the biggest question here is, all right, now we're having another hearing. It's going to be in the afternoon. CBS News released a poll just a couple of weeks ago ahead of this hearing where they found something like 31 percent of folks who have been paying attention to this say that this is going to make them more likely to vote for Republican 40 percent who are following the hearing. Say it's going to make them more more likely to vote for Democrats. But the timing of the release of this report and the expectation here in the beltway is that this is the final hearing ahead of the midterms. That's going to be incredibly, incredibly watched if it's after the midterms, which is looking like potentially what it could be. How will that see up 2024 candidates who are looking to to launch their campaigns? We'll be watching. All right, Kevin Sir, really, Yahoo Finance's own joining us here to really discuss and break down. We're watching in the beltway and beyond. Well, Kevin, appreciate it. Anytime. Thanks, guys. Definitely coming up. Why are next guests?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,7,2022-10-10 14:24:09
2894," Let me go see here to really discuss and break down where we're watching in the belt way and beyond. Well, Kevin, appreciate it. Anytime. Thanks, guys. Definitely. Coming up, why are next guests that continue to uncertainty in Europe will cause the US dollar to remain strong. We'll discuss that next. The strong dollar might be here to stay as war and uncertainty in Europe and the UK abroad make the USA comparatively better place to invest. This plus a spendy consumer here at home could mean inflation is set to remain higher for longer for more. Let's bring in Joseph Lewis who is the Jeffries head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Joe, great to have you here with us today. First and foremost, we've already heard a lot of tech companies, especially, really give their insight or at least forecast into how much FX headwinds would continue to impact them. Is it going to be in par or in line with or even greater than what they anticipated? First things to remember about companies and how they think about foreign exchanges is that it's an averaging process. What you see immediately today will take some time to flow through their earnings. I think what you'll expect is that if the dollar continues to be strong, which is generally the expectation, you're going to see this show up probably Q1, Q2 next year. As the move recently has been so quick that companies haven't had the time for that to flow completely through the income statement. Look, what we're telling companies is what I spend most of my days doing is to give people advice around strong dollars probably here to stay. You summed it up correctly, which is when you think about your alternatives, the UK, Europe, Asia, the US continues to make a ton of sense in terms of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,8,2022-10-10 14:28:30
2895," summed it up correctly, which is when you think about your alternatives to UK, Europe, Asia, the U.S. continues to make a ton of sense in terms of where people want to keep assets going forward. So, Joseph, you said that things, you're employing things are going to get worse because the dollar keeps on going up and there's a delayed effect. This is what companies do, right? They hedge currencies. When they're going up, they're going down. This is part of their operations. As you said, you helped them do that. What is it about this current environment that is so tricky for them? Is it the speed of the move in the dollar, the persistence of it? Is there something unique about this point in time? Well, it's two parts, right? I think it's the speed. And then what you have is the persistence, right? And I think for companies, the hard part right here is companies are hedging six to 12 months out. And for a year at most, 18 months for the companies that are a little bit more aggressive. And so the decision to make is if I go and hedge now and go and lock in what is potentially a problem that may bounce back, right? And so the hardest part for companies right now is to really determine will this persist? And when you have this discussion back and forth about, there's going to be a recession in the US which probably could mean the dollar could weaken, it's hard for companies to make decisions, right? You can take 10 economists and you've probably had two or three people on. They'll say slightly different things have slightly different forecasts. And I think that's been really challenging for my clients is sort of, there is an consistency in view. And a lot of times the views have changed so rapidly, right? Six months ago, the view was very different than it is today. And so, you know, it's summed up. I think it's just hard for companies to make decisions in this market when you have this much volatility. And, you know, the outcome is so determined, really not by fundamentals, but really by policy. Joe, what sectors are doing a good job of hedging in this environment? Well, it's funny. I would say, you know, I wouldn't say some sectors. I think it's the size of companies that are doing better. The larger companies just have much more developed policies. They're just doing more. They've got a history of hedging. They've just been global longer. I think it's the new companies that over the last five, 10 years have seen rapid growth. You know, that growth has been faster than their ability to put policy in place, right? So, you know, I wouldn't say it's a sector, right? I think it's, I would say companies that are seeing, you know, have seen meteoric growth over the last 10 years are probably a little bit behind the April. The companies that have been global for 10, 20 years and to be, then to have policies and tend to be managing effects already. Smaller companies are also a little bit troubling, right? Because they, you know, for them, they're still growing, right? And you kind of want to grow and then have hedges in place. So I would say, you know, companies that are big and have grown rapidly recently and smaller companies. I probably worry the most about. And so with the size of those companies that you're really studying across and researching around, it also comes down to their employee base in all of these countries too. What role does the workforce, the employment and the wages across those different entities? What does that play as well in some of the FX considerations? Look, if you can have earnings and costs locally, that's your best outcome, right? So if I can sell my goods in a country and hire locally, that gives me cost to offset revenue. The companies that have the most issues will tend to be companies that have a lot of intellectual capital in one country and then sell goods in the other. So think about tech. Well, if all your programmers are in one country but you're selling goods globally, you don't actually have cost to offset. So companies are starting to think about that, right? How do I create natural offset? Where do I want to have my labor force capital to offset some of my FX risks? That's the ideal situation. Most companies aren't set up that way. They tend to have what you tend to find and you look at a tech sector, you tend to have a lot of costs in the U.S. for the U.S. companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,9,2022-10-10 14:32:53
2896," Most companies aren't set up that way. They tend to have what you tend to find, and you're going to tech sector, you tend to have a lot of costs in the US, for the US companies, and a lot of net income overseas. And so that's always a challenge. Just bottom line, what do you think the magnitude of the effect of stronger dollars going to be in terms of the hit to US corporate earnings? You'll look, I get the benefit, I would say, of not having to look and try to estimate that. The answer's far. That's a very hard question, because companies man it, and when you think about the market, the largest companies that dominate the S&P into Dow, they have FX policies in place, right? And so I think overall, it's probably bigger than people are going to expect. And companies will come out and tell you, they'll say on a constant currency basis, we are X, but I, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have an exact number, but I would say is I do probably at this persistence the next year, that it's probably going to be larger people expect. Good analysis here. Joseph Lewis, Jeffries head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Have a good rest of the week. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Coming up, Netflix stands to mint money from its new ad tier servers to awesome calls of the day. Coming up next. Welcome back. Let's fire off a few calls on the day on this Monday morning. I'm locking in on a good note at a JP Morgan on Netflix. Another note out here explaining the potential financial windfall from an ad tier service, which Netflix is expected to launch next year. And they're correctly pointing out this. This is Alan Doug Anmouth noting quote, the Netflix narrative shifted from slow to no subscriber growth in the current business to advertising and page sharing coming in 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,10,2022-10-10 14:37:12
2897," really pointing out this, this analyst Doug Anmouth noting quote, the Netflix narrative shifted from slow to no subscriber growth in the current business to advertising and page sharing coming in 2023. You can see that in the stock price. Netflix shares up about 22% in the past three months is really cut fire overall still down 63% year or a day, but still a lot of optimism around the financial potential of this ad service. Anmouth is putting this at potential almost $3 billion by 2026 and maybe 22 million subscribers just in this ad service loan by 2026 next year looking at potential 600 million ad sales from the service. Right. A tear that they moved up in terms of the launch and saying now we're pointing now to November to actually bring the launch into market and it's really going to be a question of when the subscribers really kind of in mass start to latch on to what that new offering could give them in terms of an experience that is lower price. Perhaps yeah, you're still going to get some ads. We know that. Of course, but that's been successful for launch of even the streaming landscape years back. We think back 10 years ago, even when Hulu had some of their ad supported tears, that's really what got some of the introductory members into the streaming services back then. And so now for Netflix, knowing that they've already really capitalized on that high end of pricing mechanisms. Now it's just trying to retain and not turn as many users. And so we could see potentially some of those users kind of downgrading the pricing at least that they're willing to pay at this point. I mean, expectations game for next blix has been the like roller coaster. It's been so fascinating, right? As you mentioned, the beginning like really people not expecting anything from the company. And now as as modeling for its ad platform has leaked, we've seen the expectations really go back up again. So it's hard to see where this goes if it's really going to meet or exceed those those new more sanguine estimates. Yeah, it's a big tell and that didn't exist for Netflix coming into coming into this year. That's for sure. Yeah, they're going to have to compete as well. Disney, even looking at exploring some of their own ad supported tears within Disney Plus, that could be a major competitor for a company that's already seen a massive subscription adoption and has quickly catapulted itself into one of the most powerful streaming services. And that's even pre a massive bundle from Disney too. Yeah. Also here we're tracking shares of craft hines. Yeah, we're going into the kitchen and into the, well, wherever you're starting to catch up and mustards that into the pantries perhaps. After Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company upgrading it to buy from neutral with a $43 price target, they're saying that this is one of the consumer staples out there where higher margins, profit margins, it's not fully baked in at this point. So for anybody who's looking to stock up on some catch ups or some mustards, perhaps craft hines is that option. But there's so many other categories that craft hines has been able to really deliver for investors, especially as consumers are really monitoring where they can either buy and bulk in some cases or just get that value that they had seen over many years. And you go back to some of the household names that have the largest brand equity. We'd seen that in some of the other fashion and apparel calls out there on the street. And craft hines is certainly one of those right now with the largest brand equity too. So for those folks last week when those conaggrant earnings numbers hit, you said watch what they said, look what they sent on prices. They had a lot of success despite people becoming more mobile again, pushing through price increases. And that is the same theme that we are seeing in this upgrade from craft hines, which is despite price increases, they're expecting all these price increases that craft took just like conagra, they are likely to stick in coming quarters. Now that comes against a backdrop of CEO Miguel Patricio, probably enough credit for taking this, getting this company off life support, being I think he's passed his two year market CEO, but he's out there cutting a lot of costs from this business. So if you have higher prices, lower costs, that's a pretty good set up for profits. Yeah, it seems that way investors are believing that today also. I'm taking a look at grab holdings. The stock has had been on the move lower down 7% right now after Barclays initiated coverage of the Asian delivery app without over its long term profitability. Now it's an equal weight rating here. It's a neutral weighting. So it's interesting to see it taking such a hit, the price target being set at $3 as you see there. And the analysis car rental costs are a substantial burden for drivers and push up fares. The analysts does say that the company is a category leader in food delivery and ride handling in Southeast.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,11,2022-10-10 14:41:39
2898," says car rental costs are a substantial burden for drivers and push up fairs. The analyst does say that the company is a category leader in food delivery and ride-hailing in Southeast Asia with a very strong competitive position. So, hence the equal weight, a little bit of good, a little bit of bad, that said, grab also might be getting caught up to some extent in just the selling that we're seeing in Asian trading. But this is a company I believe it came public through a SPAC if I'm not mistaken. And the stock has not done very well since it did come public through that. Yeah, you think about the ride-sharing environment. Not just here in the U.S., but internationally and that's where grab really gets pulled into the conversation there in the markets that they operate where consumers right now for either the pricing that they're seeing higher or the options that are on the market in getting into micro-mobility or other forms of mobility within a broader parent app, if you will, as Uber and Lyft has tried to add on some of that micro-mobility element for grab. It's very similar, but in a market where there is much more of that micro-mobility, that is actually taken advantage of by the consumers here. So, it's going to be how do you reach profitability while building up some of the other mobility mechanisms for consumers and knowing that you still have to make a lot of investments to retain drivers in one sense, but also decrease the operating per mile costs. And that's going to be a significant headwind still for all of these companies as they try to either dabble more in autonomous technology and how quickly that comes forward is a question Mark's still up in the air at this point as well, but for grab that is going to be something that they have to consider similarly as Uber and Lyft do. Well, I haven't bothered with this. It's a $2.50 stock. Most people I would say watching this have never even heard a grab or taken a grab. If you were that hell bent on using or investing in a ride-sharing business, go with Uber. We used to have Brad Arxson saying Uber is starting to really take market share from its largest competitor in the United States lift. That might be the better way to play this space if you really want to. Well, from one mechanism of riding and ride-sharing to another one in owning a vehicle perhaps, we're also watching shares of Tesla this morning after Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas cut his price target on Tesla from $383 to $350. Warning of continued headwinds into the fourth quarter and 2023. One of the notables here, the fiscal year 2023 delivery forecast, cut to $1.8 million versus the $2 million previously out there saying that they believe the buy-side consensus range for fiscal year 2023 in deliveries is in the $1.7 million to actually $1.9 million range there. Is that how Adam Jonas actually exists? He's got his notes. I've actually never seen his face. I've been sending him emails for over 10 years. It doesn't really get back to me at all. But look, his notes are really good. He's a market mover, auto-stocks. I appreciate his work, appreciate his diligence on Tesla, which is love to see his face. Is he a sister-shoot? Maybe. Just a few more things from the note, if I may. So he says the company is going through peak auto margins right now, which is interesting. He talks about margin headwinds from ramping up to gigafactory zone, two different continents as something that can be a negative for the company. He also says the company could be experiencing demand destruction, which is really interesting here, and also flies a little bit against what I feel like is the conventional wisdom around Tesla, which is that demand is inexhaustible, right? But that it's supply stuff that is maybe held constrained profits. So it's interesting that he's saying there is a little bit of demand destruction going on there. And while they're also trying to ramp up the capacity and production, and so even if you've got the ability to ramp up all of the output at Shanghai Gigafactory at Austin and Berlin, sure that's more capacity that's coming online, but at what cost if the consumers are either opting for a different brand that's coming into market, or if they're just saying we don't like the price of the Tesla's put out their own street. I'm actually Adam Jonas, I wrote that note. You are. All right, coming up, we're listening investment trust. You would think that they would be vulnerable in a high interest rate environment. Our next guest says they are indeed well prepared. I hope you with us next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,12,2022-10-10 14:45:55
2899," Good luck! Sure! you you Yeah you're National Association of Reads, Economist John Worth, joined us now. John, you know, I think of reads as a group that are vulnerable when there's a rising interest rate environment for a number of different reasons. They tend to carry relatively high levels of debt, right? So their services in costs are higher. And they're seen as sort of because of their high dividend yields as almost a competing asset for something like treasuries as their yields are going higher. So talk us through why you think they're well positioned here. Absolutely. Happy to do it. You know, I think the view of reads as being high leverage players is one that is a little bit out of date, frankly. What we've seen is that reat leverage has been coming down for basically a decade. So today we've got leverage ratios near all time lows. The debt that reads are holding is quite well termed out. They've got a weighted average term to maturity today of about seven years plus net interest expense as a share of their operating income is at all time lows. And about 85% of their debt is fixed rate. So they're really quite well positioned for a period of rising interest rates. And just as we compare them to other income-generating alternatives, it's important to keep in mind that reads provide income, but they're not fixed income, right? So they provide both income through their steady dividends as well as capital appreciation opportunities. And typically what we see is that in a period where you're coming out of a, where you're coming out of a potential period of slow growth as we might be in about a year that we see reads do quite well. So why would someone look at reads versus say high growth internet at this point, even though high growth internet is perhaps being redefined, reads still have to compete for the same attention when investors are looking to get back into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a point-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,13,2022-10-10 14:49:54
2900," into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a portfolio construction perspective. One of the things we see is that commercial real estate is such a fundamental piece of the overall economy that's really critical for investors of all types. But is commercial real estate still as necessary if you have less people that are going into offices or there's more of a hybrid work approach? Is it still carrying the same weight? Absolutely. I think you really need to think about the breadth of commercial real estate. Commercial real estate, I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So for example, in REITs, you have data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. So you're getting the breadth of the economy that's housing the modern, the breadth of the real estate that's housing the modern economy. So you may feel like hybrid work is going to have people in the office less. That means you're going to have more activity through data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage names should do well? Like they did in the Great Recession. Yeah, and I don't think public storage and the other self-storage places are really going to benefit significantly from people maybe losing their homes. What we see is that that's a sector where we saw a huge bump during COVID, a huge bump in demand as people used the space they had differently. So they cleared out the guest room. They cleared out the garage and turned those into gyms and maybe school rooms in some cases. That gave a huge bump to self-storage demand. Then that was got another dose of demand as the residential real estate market heated up. As that market falls down, we may see some diminution in demand. Whenever you have people making transitions in their lives, whether that that's moving, sending kids to school, bringing kids back into the household, what you see is that you they're using self-storage as part of that. All right, you gave me a whole new reason to rewatch storage wars. National Association of Reats Economists. John Worth, John, appreciate the time here today. Thanks. Coming up everyone, Black Friday deal season. It's kicking off. Wait a minute, it's October 10th, early a target.

2901," the It is time for Cut for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this. Another controversy for Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, faced social media restrictions over the weekend after users accused the rapper of posting anti-semitic content leading to a block on both his Instagram and Twitter accounts. The reaction from this was interesting, that was reaction from Elon Musk and Elon of course has been noted to say that he is going to do more post acquisition to try and let everybody back on the platform. Raises a larger question of what Twitter will actually be if you still just have this cesspool of some of the harmful or derogatory statements that are coming back onto the platform from either Ye or even former president Donald Trump. Yeah, and I have a lot of questions about the companies that have just had to partner with Ye in various business ways. I mean, we saw it having with Gap and the fallout from that. You see now Adidas is assessing its relationship with him. And I think, you know, when they're trying to tap into his creativity, his place in the zeitgeist, right? At the same time, they have to be cognizant of some of the potential disadvantages of partnering with somebody who can be very volatile. Good point. Black Friday is coming early for target shoppers. Retailer announced it's adding an additional three weeks to its Black Friday deals, extending the discount offerings of up to 50% off to seven weeks total. This is, I think, target just being target. Also, I should mention we got some Adobe sales data out today predicting the holiday season sales rise to and a half percent. You're not great. But this will be one of the most aggressive discounting seasons yet. Holiday seasons, according to Adobe. So there's lots of big deals out there. Lot of retailers, even target Walmart, sitting on a lot inventory. They have to move this stuff. They're going to start moving it early. I mean, if you go to that target website today, Black Friday is like plastered across the deals page. It's pretty interesting. Move over Lululemon's we made too much. And here is we've got way too much over a target. And that's going to be the story for a lot of retailers over the course of this holiday season. How do they turn through inventory at a massively accelerated clip in order to get back into a decent position come the start of 2023 as well? And for the consumer, how are they spending? Is it cash that they're willing to spend right now? Or is it, hey, let's just put it on the credit card. Let's figure that out later. It's going to be great. Target gets half of my paycheck. That place is just so addicted. You go in there and you just look to spend 20 bucks and you're down 150. You don't even know what you got. Tarje. Crazy. What? All right. And I anticipate it's side effect of Apple's new crash detection features come to light. The Wall Street Journal reporting several incidents of iPhone 14 users triggering 911 calls while riding roller coasters. So what's the deal here? Is that the iPhone automatically calls 911 with like an automated message if it thinks you've gotten into a car crash? Well, I guess being on a roller coaster feels like that you've gotten into a car crash. So they keep calling 911 and police keep showing up to various amusement parks around the country. Yeah. I mean, Swift responses that we're actually seeing triggered from the devices. So we know it works. It's just a question of, okay, how do you rein that in a little bit more? Because this is some of the technology that's featured not just in Apple's new iOS for their iPhones, but also within the watch itself. So if you have enough people that have those companion devices, you're going to see a lot of those errant, triggered calls to 911. Well, it says this out real time. No, shake it, shake it. No, I don't have an auto. I don't have a new iPhone. And no, no, I don't. Well, if you like fall down, I don't know how sensitive. Police are showing up to your house. Yeah. And how is the sensor different in this case versus when you're, say, running on a treadmill or doing some other activity? All good questions. All right.

Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Monday to all of you. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what we're watching at this hour holding pattern and inflation data in the start of results. It's another critical week for financial markets. We're going to be discussing fighting the Fed with all springs, George Borey. Treasury Secretary Jenna Yellen warns about the economic impact from OPEC's latest production cut. We're tracking the fallout as Washington waves a response. Frank MacCurello with the American Petroleum Institute is going to be joining us this hour with his take on the oil cartels decision. And electric vehicles going solar. The CEO of German Auto Start-up Sonomoto joins us later in the show to discuss his ambitions. At the car maker plan to rev up the US EV market. First though we are as always taking a look at the market action right now. 90 minutes into the trading day. We are seeing some of those losses accelerate red across the board here. Take a look at the bottom of the screen there. The NASDAQ now hitting a two year low. Down about 1.3% a lot of this coming on the back of still reaction coming from the White House and the administration's very latest efforts to crack down on semi-conductors or specifically crack down on Chinese ship makers.

Named Vidya, Intel, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, AMD, you get the picture, all of them down today on the back of that extended reaction. Of course, we sell the Chinese shipmakers down in a big way overnight in Asia trading as well. Well, there is a very busy week ahead of us for the markets. This is earning seasoned approaches and more key economic data rolls in. And we've got our very own Yahoo finances and Ned's for a kick things off for us this hour and Ned's. We're talking about earnings, economic data, certainly a lot to process in the week ahead. Yeah, that's right. A lot of data that will be watching that the markets are going to be watching. PPI, the producer price index will be coming out this week. Now this is the change in price which producers receive for their services and goods. So that's expected to come in at 7.3%. The prior reading was 7.3. But the CPI, the consumer price index, that's the really big one on Thursday which will be coming out. And that is expected to, on a year over year, expectation is that's for 8.1%. The core CPI, that's excluding food and energy, that's expected to come in at 6.5%. Now, the big thing here with this, with PPI, with CPI is that the numbers, although they may be well for the core CPI, it's actually that would be up from the previous one. But as far as the expectations, the numbers may not be coming down fast enough. And so if they're not coming down fast enough, then the Fed certainly has room to keep hiking. Also this week, you've got the FBOMC minutes that are coming out. And that will be interesting because the Kiko, we will be able to also see, if there's any discussion in those minutes about the size of the rate increases, if at any point the Fed is considering to sort of put a little bit of a break on those rate increases. Yeah, and the income is at a time, and obviously there's a debate about weather. In fact, the Fed needs to pause a bit because they've been moving so quickly, is it going to be 50 basis points? Is it going to be 75 come November? And of course, the administration's watching it closely. One more FBOMC meeting before the midterm. So a lot today, just there on that front. And as thanks so much for that. Well, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jenner Yellen is warning about the impact OPEC's oil production cut will have on the global economy, telling the financial times the decision is in her words unhelpful and unwise. This, of course, reinforcing the Biden administration's criticism over this move as questions arise on the repercussions that lie ahead. Let's bring in Frank McEarrula. He is API senior vice president of policy, economics, and regulatory affairs. Frank, it's good to talk to you today. We have heard several officials from the administration push back against OPEC's decision from last week. The White House saying it was short-sighted, saying that they will, in fact, respond moving forward. What is that decision meant for U.S. oil producers? Sure. Thanks for having me on. Look, you know, first off, it's a reminder, again, of how important it is to produce energy here in the United States and not have to rely on foreign countries like the OPEC plus nations for our energy. We have the capacity to continue to strengthen our energy security by tapping into the resources we have right here at home. And the more we do that, the less we're reliant and driven by decisions that are made somewhere else. And we did hear your president and CEO Mike Summers put out a statement on the back of that OPEC decision last week saying specifically, we urge the administration to adopt sound public policy that enables American energy to benefit Americans. What specifically does that sound policy look like? Sure. At API, we released a plan called the 10-22 that would open up federal lands and waters for oil and gas production. The Biden administration at the outset of their term closed new leasing for oil and gas development. So we would propose to open it up and continue to produce more here in the United States. The plan also calls for more energy infrastructure. Biden administration canceled critical.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,17,2022-10-10 15:07:25
2904," those to open it up and continue to produce more here in the United States. The plan also calls for more energy infrastructure. The Biden administration canceled critical pipeline projects. We think the process for permitting of pipeline projects needs to be reformed so we can get energy from where it's produced to where it's needed. We also call on the plan to lift the barriers that are created by tariffs. We know that there is a supply chain issue currently in being able to produce more energy. And so we need to knock those barriers down. Finally, we think it's important to expedite LNG exports. The administration has made a commitment to Europe to export natural gas to provide relief from their reliance on Putin's natural gas. And so we think we need a strong policy that expedites LNG exports. And how quickly would you be able to move on that specifically on LNG? Well we're urging Congress and the administration to act quickly on all components of this plan. I think on LNG, it's really a question of a commitment from the government to expedite applications, a commitment from Europe to build down the necessary infrastructure to take the natural gas into its countries. But there is a commitment there on both sides. And so what we need is an acceleration of that. The oil and gas industry stands ready to help. There is another legislation that's been floating around for some time. And this is no pack specifically stands for no oil producing and exporting cartels act. This would essentially empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC under anti-trust rules if they are seen as setting or at least trying to attempt to control the price of oil. The Biden administration, at least in their statement, seems to suggest they want to revisit that. But I know API has specifically been very opposed to this idea. Why? This policy has been opposed on both sides of the aisle and from administrations in both parties. The real way to get OPEC is to produce more energy here in the United States. And the way to do that is to lift the pause that the administration has had on leasing. Look, at this point in the Obama administration, they had issued 60 leases for oil and gas development. This point in the Biden administration, they're just at six. And so if the administration wants to get serious about energy security and energy independence, it needs to look right here at home. And it needs to provide a pathway for more energy production here in the United States. But finally, Frank, you sort of alluded to the need for more exports coming out of the U.S. at a time when there are concerns about supply globally. You have put out a letter here saying that any kind of export ban we're talking about diesel, but also refined products would deplete inventory levels and it would put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices. Of course, the administration argument would be, we'll add a time when there was concerns about supply crunch, that supply should be left domestically. So walk me through your calculation. Why does this deplete supply in your opinion? And why would that push prices higher? Sure, it's not our opinion in July of this year, the American Council for Capital Formation studied this issue. They found that an export ban on refined product would end up cutting refinery capacity by 1.3 million barrels per day here in the United States. It would end up raising costs for fuel for consumers across the United States. It would cost jobs, about 85,000 jobs would be lost under such a policy. And finally, it would harm American GDP. And so for all of those reasons and for American energy security, the refined export product ban is a bad idea. Finally, this administration has made a commitment to our allies overseas, to other countries that we support, to Latin America, where we export an enormous amount of refined product. It's made a commitment to those allies that we're going to continue to provide the energy that we have right here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly imposing such a policy would certainly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,18,2022-10-10 15:11:44
2905," here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly, imposing such a policy would certainly not help the American consumer. And where are those conversations stand right now with the administration? I know there's been a bit of a back and forth. Oftentimes it has been reported as being a little more contentious. In terms of specifically an export ban, what's your understanding of where the administration stands? Well, we've made the case. We've laid out the data that shows that such a policy would have negative implications for the American people, for the driving public. I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United States has world-class leading refineries. And they produce the fuels that the world needs. And so we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or LNG. Frankly, looks toward American energy production as the solution. We've set all along the solution to the challenges that we face, actually lie under our feet. Because of innovation and technology, we've increased production here in the United States. From seven million barrels to 12 million barrels per day, we can do more. We need the policies in place to help us achieve that.

2906," I I am I am I am I'm We are on the cusp of yet another earning season and markets are turning to JP Morgan, City Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley as they report during the most uncertain of economic environments for preview of what to expect. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexandra Seminova. These are always, it's always a good bell leather, right? About where things are in terms of the economy, as we said, never been more uncertain. Yeah, absolutely a key go. Those four bangs among the six largest in the US by assets are set to be the opening act of the earnings season with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America set to release results next week. And some of the themes that we'll be watching closely are a slowdown in investment banking revenues, potential layoffs across their businesses, how demand for loans is holding up with higher interest rates, and any potential warnings about the economy that CEOs may deliver on earnings calls. And this quarter profits are expected to shrink, especially compared to a really robust 2021 for Wall Street. Profits are also likely to take a hit from higher loan loss provisions. Those are funds that aside by banks for any potential sour loans if customers don't make their payments. The six largest US banks are estimated to set aside a collective $4.5 billion this quarter that's according to financial times report today. And this is also a turnaround from a year ago when banks actually benefited from releasing those reserves as we were recovering from the pandemic. One notable thing to note too is that banks typically benefit from higher interest rate environments. Those often give them a nice boost on their net interest income. But investment banking revenue is likely to offset that. And some other things to look out for too are any comments that bank executives make. Jamie Diamond is always an interesting one on his earnings calls with his storm cloud warnings. Credit, Swiss, and the broad, what that means for the broader industry. And also a bank of American Morgan Stanley are estimated to lose a combined $500 million on Elon Musk's Twitter deal. You know, with noting the bar pretty low, going into earnings season, not just within banks, but overall. Thanks so much for that. I know you're going to be tracking those results really closely moving on here as we look ahead to. There you go. There's the prompt. Let's take a wider look on market. TD Ameritrade out with its investor movement index showing traders took a more risk off approach in September for more about what these results mean and what's driving the trends. Let's bring in Sean Cruz. TD Ameritrade head trading strategist Sean. These notes are always really interesting to me. A very good gauge of where the retail investor stands feels like it's pretty much tracking with the rest of the market. Things just aren't feeling very good. Yeah, I think right now, we got a little bit of a head fake back in August. There was actually recovery for the first time this year. We actually had that investor movement index tick higher. And I think that quickly got wiped off the table in September. So what we did see in what clients were buying, they were certainly being a little bit more conservative and that they weren't going out there buying some of the more speculative areas of the market, some of the more speculative names that maybe aren't profitable right now or just have some very high multiples. They're not really reaching for those right now. They're going back to some of the more familiar established names out there. In some cases, really looking at names with quality fundamentals be that solid revenues, solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,20,2022-10-10 15:20:36
2907," Solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets, leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact some of those more highly leveraged companies versus the more fundamentally sound companies. So, they still found some opportunities out there, but they certainly are a little bit cautious right now and I think that makes sense. And we're going to get to some of those names we just showed on the screen there, but broadly speaking, what has led to the sell-off that you have seen exiting of positions? Is it really just about the Fed? I think that really was what drove that optimism in August and that light at the end of the tunnel from the Fed pausing or potentially even reversing some of those rate hikes gave it, drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light at the end of the tunnel ended up being a train coming your way instead. And that really drove that shift in sentiment in that not only were we getting some data that did indicate they haven't made significant progress, they are starting to have an effect, look at housing for instance, but the Fed kept coming out. Whenever the market would give a little bit of a pop of optimism, you would almost have a Fed speaker somewhere and somewhere come out and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion and that's why we're trading down at these levels. I think the market's going to respond differently to maybe a hawkish Fed when we're trading at 3600 on the S&P 500 versus say trading up at 4,000 or 4,200. So I do think a lot of that is now priced in if things get significantly worse and that's why we just spoke about the bank earnings, that is going to be huge. The macro read through on what we hear from the banks, I think is really going to set the tone for the rest of earnings seasons and I think the market is also going to change their macro outlook based on what we hear. So let's talk about some of those names that we have seen big moves in. In terms of net buyers, we're seeing a lot of the chip makers, you could argue that's part of evaluation play, given just how far some of these names have pulled back. But in terms of those that are being sold, Exxon mobile and BP, an interesting one to me, because energy has been pretty strong is this sort of the expectation that we have reached the peak with some of these names and the pull back is coming. That is where we see that type of activity. I don't think anyone expects crude oil to completely fall apart anytime soon, but I do think they're looking at it from a little bit more of a valuation standpoint. And we have seen that where you get these energy companies trading towards the bottom of their range. That's where there's a lot of interest in buying when they recover and they start hitting towards the upper end of those ranges. That's where they rotate out of those. So I think it's an interesting strategy. It's more of a short term strategy. I think we see playing out, but they use those profits when they do decide to roll out and lower exposure in those names. We actually do see them going out there and trying to find opportunity elsewhere. And the semiconductors last month was that key spot. I think we saw a lot of interest on the buy side. Certainly today I think caught a lot of people off guard. If you look at the semiconductors that are really getting hit, it's the semiconductor companies that really have a lot of exposure to that relationship with China and just what goes on the entrepreneur offshore aspect of their supply chains. But I think what they were looking at, if you look at the charts, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, all those names were hitting the support levels. And when you see the support levels, these ranges, they start to approach the lower end. That's where you get a lot of buying activity. I'm going to venture, guess what we look at this again next month. We're going to see a lot of selling as they broke through some of those. I was going to say, I wonder if some of that buying holds, especially as we get these warnings about demand, especially from a lot of these big chip makers. He has them see another one, or started to hear from this week. Sean Cruz, a TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Thanks so much for joining us today. Well coming up bullish call, Bernstein says Airbnb is on track to become the biggest Western travel platform. But what about recession fears? COVID and some competitors. We'll chat that next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,21,2022-10-10 15:24:51
2908,"... A.B. Bernstein is getting bullish on Airbnb. Initiating coverage and outperform what a $143 price target, saying it's rapid and profitable growth removes a key hurdle. It's valuation. Joining us now is Richard Clark, managing director at A.B. Bernstein. Richard, there's a number of things that you highlight here, but really the point being that this isn't just about Airbnb being able to protect its market share and the vacation rental business. Do you think they could really make a significant play on hotels and experiences as well? Walk me through that thesis. Yeah, I mean, I think that's absolutely right. So, I think the vacation rental market is still very exciting. I think it's a big market. It's going to gain share of the overall lodging market and Airbnb will think we'll gain share within that. But probably beyond that, even more exciting, is that ability to sell more than just vacation rental market. It doesn't market as much as other travel platforms, so it has a loyal customer following, as a very strong brand. And we think they can sell longer stays, hotel rooms, experiences, and they can add to its growth. The longer stays have been a real growth spot for Airbnb, something they've been highlighting, especially over the course of the pandemic. The hotels specifically, where do you see them making a play when you look at how fragmented the market is right now? Yeah, so I mean, I think actually the hotel market is fragmented. The distribution market is not that fragmented, you've got booking and expedior, they're quite dominant in their respective geography. So, I think the actual hotels are looking for other distribution channels to broaden their landscape a little bit. And I think Airbnb is unique in the sense that it does try and inspire the customer. You know, it's got this category-based search. It tries to find a way to match the customer and the product up in the way that we don't see in other companies. And I think that gives it a way to make a play in hotels. So you see the platform evolving into a place where hotels can also list their openings? Well, they're already on. I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on Airbnb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,22,2022-10-10 15:29:19
2909," and also list their openings? Well, they're already on, I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on on on Airbnb, Airbnb, bought hotels tonight. They signed a deal with side-minder. They signed a deal with OVO and that gave them probably somewhere around 70 to 80,000 hotels. But that's only just scratching the surface. There's probably 10 times that many hotels in the world. And I think through COVID, they focus on the core business. And hotels is one thing that they can try and reignite post the other side of COVID. And yet put it alongside the vacation rentals on its platform. Richard, we've been talking so much about a lot of these companies within the sharing economy, whether that's in Uber, food delivery, Airbnb, among them. You know, they all started after the financial, after the great recession. And it was sort of in earlier days used as a platform for a lot of people to make some extra cash on the side. Yeah. You know, how much of a catalyst do you think if we are looking at a further downturn in the macro picture? I mean, could that be a potential catalyst for Airbnb to bring in more hosts and really expand the platform in a way? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I think first of all, there's quite a lot of dormant hosts on Airbnb, like there's a lot of listings that haven't taken a booking in the last year. Maybe that's because of COVID, nervousness around that. So maybe part of it is bringing existing hosts back onto the platform. And then, yeah, I think beyond that, they're probably are other people that will need to supplement their income. They'll need to offset the fact that maybe they paid higher mortgage costs or higher rental costs. And that may bring entirely new supply to the market. Okay, Avery Bernstein, Managing Director Richard Clark, appreciate your time today. Thank you. Well, coming up, prepare for landing. The Fed attempting a controlled descent in stormy weather. This week, we'll get more clarity on the direction of travel through fresh inflation data. We've had bonds on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,23,2022-10-10 15:34:59

There's pressure on the coffee giant to engage. We're going to start scrolling from both workers, shareholders and regulators. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexis Keenan. With a broad state of play right now and in many ways Friday was a big step. It was. It was. It was. It was. We're resolving. We are. Yeah, so let's talk about what happened. But first let's kind of look at the state of affairs for Starbucks and this unionization push by its baristas across its retail stores in the US. You have among its 900 or 9,000 rather corporate owned US stores. About 220 of them have unionized so far. Also the number of union votes that have been held as of Thursday, 309 ballot counts, 248 of those ending in yes votes to unionize. 54 of those saying no and seven under a challenge right now. But Friday was significant and there's two reasons for that. One is that it was the first time that workers in Arkansas have chosen to go ahead and petition to unionize and that brings the number of states that actually have unionized stores to 38 among the 50 states. And it also Friday was the first time that the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Starbucks illegally fired one of its workers and that was for taking part in unionization activity. So that's kind of a big deal right for the labor board to say for the first time among a lot of complaints that have been filed. There are 35 filed so far that yes Starbucks was in the wrong here. And as a consequence what Starbucks is going to have to do is going to reinstate that employees job, give that employee back pay, but also have a meeting with the Starbucks workers there and this is Ann Arbor Michigan by the way. The Starbucks workers, its management as well as government has to take part in the talks where it's going to have to read a notice about what exactly was illegal about its actions. So it's going to have to have this sort of mea culpa and get everybody together and say these are your rights. Now as for Starbucks part, we reached out to Starbucks, we haven't heard back yet but the company has told Bloomberg that these claims that were in this complaint for this Ann Arbor worker, they call them categorically false. So just a lot of changes here for Starbucks and the company is continuing to fight these challenges, these efforts by their workers across the country to unionize. So just a bit of pressure here, particularly on Friday, so kind of a big turn with this NLRB decision coming down. And you talk about the various pressure points that are sort of mounting against Starbucks. Another one coming from the New York City controller, what do we know about that? Right. So I will have to get back to you with more information on that. I haven't been focusing on that as much a key go, but certainly the New York has wanted a Starbucks to go ahead and follow the rules that the National Labor Relations Board lays out for these push, these petitions by workers to follow what is required under law for these elections to take place. Okay. Staying on top of it for us, Alexis Keenan, thanks so much for that. One of the Fed's biggest critics of late is that it again, speaking on CBS yesterday, Alianz's chief economic advisor, Muhammad Al Ariin, said he fears, quote, a very high probability of damaging a recession that was totally avoidable. He'll track higher in the aftermath of Friday's jobs, report him into indication the Fed will need to continue its hiking round. The next guest says a hard landing is likely. Let's get into the discussion with George O'Bouray. He's all spring global investments, chief investment strategies for fixed income and Georgia doesn't sound promising. Hi, Keigo. Thanks for having me on the show. It's a rough backdrop. It's a rough economic backdrop. And one of the challenges that the Fed faces is that at this juncture in the cycle, good news is effectively bad. And that's simply because the Fed is trying to fight inflation. We know that. They've been at it now for quite some time throughout this year. They still feel behind the curve. We're going to see the data. We're going to see a new set of inflation data on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,24,2022-10-10 15:37:51
2911," that they've been at it now for quite some time throughout this year, they still feel behind the curve. You know, we're going to see the data. We're going to see a new set of inflation data on Thursday with the CPI report. Expectations are, you know, headline CPI should come down a little, but core inflation is likely to keep rising. And it's really, when you take that inflation data, plus the strong, relatively strong employment data from Friday, it would suggest that the economy in the US is still, it's still expanding and it's still chugging along at a pretty good pace. And the Fed has told us very clearly that they want to slow that down. So from other commentators from us as well, the expectation is the Fed's going to get what they want. They need to slow growth. They will slow growth. And if you look into the first half of next year, the sort of lag defect of all these rate hikes should start to bite. And so the probability of a recession, it's going up. And we think it's actually going up fairly quickly. And that's likely to really start to unfold as we get into the beginning part of next year. So how does that set things up going into the next FOMC meeting? And there's certainly a debate on this sidelines that's happening about whether in fact the Fed should maybe pause a bit here to really allow for those rate hikes that have already been implemented to take root. Are we getting any indications of that potential pause, especially when you say the risk of a recession is growing? Well the Fed has kind of painted themselves into a box. They've said that they're going to respond to the data and they've sort of taken a much more of a near term approach. They need to see current data demonstrate that inflation is coming down on a sustained basis. That takes sort of multiple months. It's going to take time. It's also going to require a broadening out of the data. So the Fed doesn't have a lot of wiggle room in here from our perspective. They need to continue to tighten and tighten policy. The question is, is simply how fast a pivot at this point, at best case scenario from a pivot standpoint, is they're able to decelerate the pace of rate hikes. Now if, if, say Wednesday's data, surprisingly comes in below expectations on both the headline and a core basis, that might provide the window of hope or open the window, if you will, for a bit of hope that a pivot of sorts might be coming. But it's still premature in our opinion. You haven't seen that sort of clear evidence to give the Fed kind of cover to really start to pivot. Now the one thing that is not really discussed all that much is just market volatility. Volatility in the bond market is very high right now. And it's likely to stay high as long as these expectations for tighter policy continue. With high volatility, some comes sort of a lot of movement in prices by definition, but liquidity also tends to dry up. If the market kind of ceases to function, well then the Fed will have to do something. But we're not at that point yet. The market's functioning, it's functioning at a slow pace, but it is still functioning. George really quickly here, it is a holiday today, but when you look at where the 10-year yield has tracked, we're off of that level just being under four, but we're still up 3-8-8, based on Friday's close. Where do you expect it to track, at least in the near term? Sure, that's a good point. There's a big distinction between the front end of the curve and the longer end of the curve. We've repriced up, if you will, we're up about 25 basis points or so on the 10-year. As you mentioned, up around 3-88, 4% is sort of our number that we expect the 10-year to consolidate around that number. We would say plus or minus 25 basis points on each side of 4%. Is really our central case as we go into the end of the year. The front end, the Fed has also been pretty clear. They want to get the front end up to about 4.5% by year end. So a 50 basis point spread, say, between the two-year and the 10-year with the two-year above the 10-year, that would be pretty consistent with tight monetary policy, restrictive monetary policy, and that should help slow growth as we go into next year.

2912," and that should help slow growth as we go into next year. George Bory, all spring global investments, chief investments, strategists for fixed income, gets talked to you today. Thank you very much. Well, coming up, we're going to be discussing a different type of EV, probably supermanium, getting electric at the NADDA, across. Yeah, I keep going. We're here at the NADDA, a different type of EV, a solar powered one, the Sion by Sona Motors. We'll talk to the CEO after this. Well, German carmaker Sona Motors is on a mission to make mobility and growing megacities more sustainable. For more on that, the CEO of the EV startup, standing by with their very own proud supermanium, live from the NADDA. Well, German carmaker Sona Motors is on a mission to make mobility and growing megacities more sustainable for more on that, the CEO of the EV startup, standing by with our very own proud supermanium, live from the NADDA, across. That's right, if you can hear it, the NADDA, Sona Motors actually listed on the NADDA, their German company listed here. They have their Sion solar powered EV here, it's right behind us. And joining me now is CEO Lauren Han. So Lauren, talk to us about the Sion, you're hearing the states. What's going on exactly? Sure. Hi, everyone. Nice to be here. This is the first solar electric vehicle being affordable. We brought it the first time to the US, first hand, first day here. Incredible car, $25,000, family, apparently affordable solar cells in the whole car body, it's re-churching itself, and it's really meant to be that mass-market electric vehicle. So you know what I mentioned this to people before they talked to me about a solar powered car, that's not totally true, you still got to plug it into getting more power. You've got... What kind of solar power, what kind of range are we going to get capture from the sun for those GPS? Giving you an example, beautiful day here in the US, in New York. We have 12 miles per day being commuted in the city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,26,2022-10-10 15:48:02
2913," fun for those PPS. Giving you an example, beautiful day here in the US and New York. We have 12 miles per day being commuted in the city on average. This car is re-charging at 13 miles a day. It's 17 miles a week on average. That's amazing because that means no re-charging for most of the commuters. And that's the big assul about electric vehicles, right? Re-charging, we can park, we'll find a charging station, range anxiety, all that stuff. That's what people are worried about. And this car is sold, solving that issue. So we know, you know, this car has a total range of around 200 miles per charge. Right. But what you're saying is that given how people use the car normally, you can basically use, basically capture as much solar power as you need to use the car on a regular basis. Let's say your car needs to run by miles each way. Right. So you're saying it's for most people, it makes sense for solar. Exactly. Commuters. We're using the car to get from A to B to work, right? And they're not driving like 200, 300 miles to work. No, they're driving on average 12 miles as a set. And this car is re-searching itself. That's the biggest hurdle about electric vehicles, and we are solving it. So where are you guys going to launch in here in Germany? What's the rollout for this car, exactly? So the first launch is in Europe. We have 42,000 down payments and pre-hers in total from B2B and B2C. And we're right now, you know, bringing out the plan for the US. We have a great plan for the US. There's huge potential here. We see huge potential for suburban markets here. Family-friendly vehicles affordable $25,000. So take a kind of a step back with this car. $25,000, very affordable. Use a solar power element. Why did you guys decide that was the way to go for EVs? Not just the grid, but capturing from the solar power. We get every day. Well, because I, you know, myself asked myself, what's a great product? And I'm living in the furt floor and don't have an own house. I don't have a own garage. And I asked myself, where do I charge? Where do I charge my electric vehicle, right? And I came always through the conclusion, it's not working. I need something more than that. And that's why we integrate it solar, because we believe it's convenience. It's extending your range. It's highly affordable, because you don't have to pay for high electricity. Electricity builds there, right? And is there more incentives in places like Europe or something, or is it sort of across the board? Are you guys getting any kind of incentive? Well, there are incentives for electric vehicles, I think across the world. In every own country, you get certain incentives. There are countries starting to incentive by a solar electric vehicle. You take a Holland, in Holland, there is an incentive for solar electric vehicles. So on top of the electric vehicle centers, in centers, you get a solar electric vehicle center. So you see the whole industry is changing to solar electric vehicles. As we believe, the next big thing in the electric mobility. So what are we talking about in terms of free orders here for the car globally? And also you got some deals in the works with car sharing, right? Yes. Yes. As mentioned, 42,000 downpapers and free orders. It's 22,000 B2s BE and 20,000 B2C reservations. The B2C reservations being downpainted with amazing 2,000 euros and average. So sticky, real reservations. People putting down 2,000 euros for this car on the waiting list. Amazing. And with that, we have the full auto book already for Europe. Right now going on tour here. New York, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, NLA. And we'll test the demand there. We already get great feedback. You also have this new fit, which I believe is a rental car company. Yes. How does that work? It's a subscription car company. They ordered just 12,600 cars. And it's an amazing order. We have so much more potential than the B2B sector. This is the perfect car for being an Uber driver, for being delivery service, for being a subscription car model. We believe there's so much more potential out there. So real quick.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,27,2022-10-10 15:50:58
2914," In Uber driver for being delivery service, for being subscription car models, we believe there's so much more potential out there. So real quick, we talked about this, the deal with Finn. You guys using Valnet to actually snake the cars because he has cars with a third party manufacturer. How soon are we going to see these cars in the road? Our plan is to launch this car and produce this car in the second half of next year. We have a great partnership with Valnet there being very experienced over 50 years of building cars. They currently producing the Diammer GLC and GLA. So they know how to produce cars and we believe we will not have production hell as you call it. Because we have outsourced the production to someone who actually knows how to produce a electric vehicle. So second half of next year potentially in Europe and then maybe in the US we'll see the tourist happening right now across the United States. Exactly. Lauren Hunt, thanks so much for the motors. Back over to you, Kiko. I know there's a bit of a delay between us but really quickly I'm seeing people check out the car behind you. When Lauren will let you take a ride. Yeah, why don't we get a ride in this car Lauren? I'll soon. Oh yeah, you can actually tomorrow. Tomorrow. So today here's a little difficult but tomorrow we will have some test rides. So sign up on our website and you can come and grab a ride with this vehicle. All right, thanks Kiko for looking at that. Oh yeah, to deal with that. I know you've driven many of these EVs. I'm going to be curious to get your review on that. Across, thanks so much for that. A live for us from the NASDAQ Market signer thanks to Lauren as well. And for one EV maker to another Tesla's China Mates sales match their monthly record. That's at least according to the China passenger car association. For the month of September the company saw an 8% increase from August and set a record for Tesla's Shanghai Factory since production began. Back in December 2019. The plans of course was shut down in July for an upgrade although will only perform at 93% capacity through the end of the year according to Reuters. Meanwhile Elon Musk weighing in on China Taiwan relations suggesting Taiwan give China control over the island to resolve the cross-rate dispute. Taiwan officials have dismissed the comment as quote ill informs and belittling while the idea has unsurprisingly gained prey. Tesla shares currently up just slightly there about 1%. While coming up islands in the stream, maybe not for much longer as reports will at showtime could become integrated into Paramount Plus. What about the future of media on the other side?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,28,2022-10-10 15:55:38
2915," weg Well, the streaming war has made claim another victim as reports a paramount is considering merging its showtime offering and to paramount plus the move comes as competition for eyeballs continues to mount what's bringing Yahoo finances to Ali Canal. The very latest one that alley. Hi, Kiko. That's right. And those reports have only been fueled by the latest executive departure at the company, David Nevin, who has run showtime since 2016 will be exiting his role at the end of the year. And that's shake up suggests that paramount is open to revamping showtime. Obviously has created some top series like you're seeing on your screen billions, yellow jackets, dexter among others. And the company can really leverage that programming to boost paramount plus subscribers. Currently paramount plus has 43.3 million subs with the expectation to reach 100 million by 2023. The exact number of showtime users is unknown, but across all of its properties paramount has about 64 million subscribers. So clearly paramount plus is the driving force on the streaming side paramount CEO Bob Backage confirmed last month that these talks were happening as a company looks toward the future. Court cutting obviously accelerating showtime lost about 500,000 subscribers in Q1 according to the CEO. So this is something that we've seen really across the sector as these platforms look to scale, look to compete. We have the combination of HBO Max and Discovery happening this summer. Stores is aiming to separate itself from Lionsgate to merge with other content providers. So consolidation is really just the name of the game at this point, especially as the streaming wars come to a head. But I have to shout out that next week we'll be discussing this and much more with paramount CEO Bob Backage during the young finance all markets summit. So make sure to tune into that. Kiko I'm very excited to talk to him because considering the news that we've been getting the past few weeks, there's a lot going on in this industry. Yeah, team things up for us. Ali for our big day, the all markets summit, of course set for Monday next week. Bob Backage among a long list of executives will be speaking to you throughout the day. Ali can now thanks so much for that. Let's do a final market check before we let you go. We are seeing all three majors still in the red right now. The NASDAQ coming off with the lows of the session, but we did see it hit two year lows there at least for intraday levels. The NASDAQ right now down about eight tenths of a percent. The S&P 500 down four tenths and the Dow trading pretty flat. The NASDAQ certainly in focus today in part because some of the sell-off that we've seen in those chip makers, this coming on the back of the latest export controls that were handed down by the Commerce Department on Friday, China, of course, responding to that. Certainly something we're going to continue to keep a close watch on. By the way, semiconductors have also been warning of some of the demand coming globally. So that's another thing that has been weighing on some of those names. As we said at the top of the show though, a lot to get through to this week with earnings on tap as well as economic data. We're going to continue to keep a close watch on all of that. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here. Yahoo Finance lies. Keep it right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,29,2022-10-10 15:59:29
2916," POWELL Brands top earnings estimates for its most recent quarter. And so a big pop in beer sales as the Modelo and Corona maker. So net sales go 15% for the beer business. Joining us now discuss this constellation brand CEO Bill Nulens, Bill, great to see you as always. Let's lock in on depletions. That fell a little bit below arguably some high estimates on the street. Have you seen any slowdown in consumer demand? No consumer demand has been very strong, Brian. In fact, our buy rate, which is the amount of times that a consumer goes to the store by how much they buy when they're there, is actually up both for our beer business and our high-end wine and spirits business. So we're very optimistic. You know, we have the benefit in this industry, in this category of being somewhat recession-resistant. And we certainly have seen no slowdown at a consumer level of purchasing against our brands. Bill, you always give it to a straight. So you call my attention with something on the earnings call. You mentioned you're going corona non-alcoholic. When does this stuff come to market? And why are you going into the non-alcoholic segment? Who's drinking this? We'll be out with that next year. But one of the things we found, Brian, was that a number of consumers who drink non-alcoholic products also drink high-end beer and high-end spirits. And we felt that this could be a natural extension, because it gives people another option on a night or an event where they, frankly, just don't want to consume, but they want to enjoy a great tasting product like we can bring from corona. But walk us through what it's going to take to continue to improve some of the depletion for constellation brands. And particularly what timelines you're tracking against for that? As you saw, our volumetric on the beer side was up almost 9% this quarter. And we see no suggestion of slowdown whatsoever. You know, Madello had its 36th consecutive quarter of double digit growth and continues to be just on fire as we extend the demographic beyond its core Hispanic base to more general market consumers. So we see just tremendous opportunity for growth. When you then add in some of the new things, you know, we just tested in three test markets, Madello Oro, which is the goal standard of light beer. We're going to roll that nationally, the beginning of next calendar year. And that we think, again, provides a very good opportunity to bring new consumers into the fold. It was very incremental in the test markets. Belle, I'm going to take a little bit of a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,30,2022-10-10 16:04:22
2917," next calendar year. And that we think, again, provides a very good opportunity to bring new consumers into the fold. It was very incremental in the test markets. Bill, I'm going to take a little bit of a left turn here and go to the cannabis issue because we did have some news on that yesterday, obviously, with President Biden issuing federal pardons for people who have been convicted of simple possession of marijuana. As you saw, pot stocks went crazy on this, on the perception that this is going to have bigger implications beyond just that. You guys own that stake in canopy growth. Can you talk me through the implications in your mind of whether this does pre-sage a bigger push towards legalization? I think Brad said something right a couple of segments ago and you talked about this before, which is it's a step on the right direction. I think it remains to be seen where it goes or how quickly it goes. The important part, I think, from our perspective is the canopy is well positioned if the legalization occurs in the United States. You know, they have deals in place with Wana and Jettie and Aikorj that will put them in a superb position when and if we see a broader legalization. But I think we've seen steps in this direction before. So, again, it's early days, but certainly it gives us some more reason for optimism. Bill, the spirits industry is just on fire, notably to Killa. When I look at your portfolio, I say, wow, they can really add something here. Are the prices for some of these brands out there? Are they just too high and that's what gives you pause? Well, we have two to kill as there were quite pleased with Casanobley at the in the luxury area and Mekapo, which frankly is just on fire at the in the sort of $20 price point. So we're quite pleased with that. But yes, certainly the values and the price points across to Killa at this point, if you were trying to acquire, have gotten quite heavy, shall we say. But our to Killa business is up double digit and we're quite pleased with where it's going. The other thing is we have a couple of messgals in our venture arm that are also doing very well. So we're keeping our eye on that subcategory as well. You said something on the something else in the earnings call bill that you're about to release a new sustainability report. What's been the feedback when you talked to institutional investors? How important is this topic and how are you thinking about that will play in just reinventing your business? It's more important to more investors every day and we've been very careful about how we think about that topic and we try to do it in ways that is beneficial for the communities in which we operate as well as for the overall environmental impact. A lot of focus on water. We've reduced our water use at our Navajo facility over the last three years by 18% per unit. We'd by 13% at our overgone operation. We've also invested within the communities that we served there to help the infrastructure and to make sure good quality water is available in those communities where we operate. So we strongly believe that this is good not only good for the world but good for business. And I think everyone we hope everyone will take a hard look at what we've done. We've worked very hard on this topic and we think and we think we're contributing to the world around us while we're still doing good business. Bill, to paraphrase Jerry McGuire and Beyonce, you had me at Miss Cowell and so as I think about some of the spirits that you've looked across the brand portfolio with and seen some strength in this environment where some businesses are looking to just show up extra cash, extra capital and perhaps some acquisitions become ripe. Are there certain companies that you're looking at and kicking the tires to see where there are more brands that you could add to constellation? We always look to see where there are opportunities and we identify the white space within our portfolio where we might be able to add some things. But we're also smart about it I think in terms of how we think about where we can get a good return. And again, as I alluded to a moment ago, the Ventur arm has been a very good way for us to put our toe in the water with some great new ideas. And we've done it in a couple of interesting ways. Our focus on female founders program as an example. We said just a few years ago that we were going to spend $100 million against women owned and women run businesses over the next 10 years. We're already 76% of the way there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,31,2022-10-10 16:08:21
2918," years ago that we were going to spend $100 million against women owned and women run businesses over the next 10 years. We're already 76% of the way there. So, you know, we're seeing a lot of ways that we can get our toe in the water on some new and exciting ideas early on, maybe before it hits big, but we're there and ready to go when it takes off. Bill, real quick before I let you go, box wine sales on fires at the ultimate recession signal. When I see that, I think back to my college days, I had no money, but there I was with my box wine pouring into soul cups and playing some beer pong or wine pong. Box box has been a very strong sector. In fact, in our in the wine business, our woodbridge box wine was the number two growing skew in that particular sector. So, we're pretty pleased about that. And it's going well for us. But it is. And it's also a convenience thing. You know, you see more and more consumers looking for convenience and box can go places that glass can't as an example. So, you often see that and tailgating or beaches and things of that nature. So, uh, so it it covers a lot of angles for sure. And PS box wine gets a bad wrap. I remember years ago, my sister brought back box wine from Sicily. It was fantastic. So, there you go, Bill. www.secret correspondents.com Let's continue our conversation on the Job Support and the the market implications joining us now. John Tobin, Epic Investment Partners, Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst. John, it's good to see you. So as we look at this, good news is bad, news is gone in jobs day. I mean, that's just very simply how we should look at it here that the Fed is going to be raising rates for the foreseeable future. I think that's right. I think the market it seems, and certainly the past few days we've seen evidence of it, it's looking for some reason, something to latch onto to justify the rally. They're hoping for some evidence that the Fed's about to pivot, the Reserve Bank of Australia's move early in the week, ignited that hope, and even on the Fed, speakers all week long pushed back on that pretty hard. I think the evidence today is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,32,2022-10-10 16:13:01
2919," Bank of Australia has moved early in the week, ignited that hope, and even on the Fed, speakers all week long pushed back on that pretty hard. I think the evidence today is from the jobs report. The jobs market still remains strong, and the Fed still has work to do. Now, as we've talked about it in our shop this morning on our morning call, there is clearly evidence of deceleration here. So if you're trying to find some good news here, that the numbers are moving in the right direction. And this is a 263K increase in jobs, but it shows continual deceleration over time. Average hourly earnings are up, but again, evidence of deceleration. So I think the main takeaway is, things are moving in the right direction, but the Fed still has a lot of work to do. Rates are still going higher. So John, should the other takeaway here, just looking at the market action in the early going is for investors to fade any rallies? Well, I think that would be my personal view that with each attempt to rally into this, I've continued to make the case that I don't see what the foundation is for a strong rally, for a sustainable rally. I mean, if you think about what the drivers of equity market returns are, its earnings growth, its dividends, and its multiple expansion. And if rates are going higher, that's a headwind from multiple expansion. And if the economy is slowing down and maybe headed for a recession, that's a headwind for earnings growth. So the main underpinnings that would support a sustainable rally just aren't there. I think to me, this is a market environment where investors need to keep some defensive exposure in their asset allocation. We've had a conversation, especially around the shift in the types of jobs, the employment situation really lays out, kind of sector by sector here. But for some of those businesses that are looking at the amount of people that post pandemic, they've realized they actually need to run the business. It also becomes a question of where some of those employees will find employment elsewhere, and in different sectors as well, as many people have upskilled over the course of the pandemic. I mean, does that drastically shape everything from wages all the way to what a solid baseline sector by sector actually looks like? Well, you're absolutely right. There are some sector trends that we're noticing here, where there's strength, where there's weakness, there's strength in leisure and hospitality, there's weakness in other sectors, there's weakness in energy, there's weakness in things related to building and construction, of course. But it's disruptive for the economy as you point out that people are looking for jobs and looking to move perhaps into new areas where there is job growth. So there is that friction, but that's not really something new, and that's a necessarily a post pandemic phenomenon. I think that's historically bending case. There's always a friction as people move and try to direct themselves into the areas where there's greater employment opportunities. John, bottom line when it comes to these markets, I think people are trying to figure out what the heck to do right now. And you have some interesting stuff in your portfolio, including consumer staples, things like Home Depot and Walmart. Do you think that a company like Walmart, for example, has gotten past its inventory troubles and is still gonna be able to benefit as we head towards the holiday season? So, it's absolutely true. The retailers have inventory issues to grapple with. And I wouldn't wanna say that for Walmart, it's all said and done and then they're behind it. I think our view on Walmart is more of a basic fundamental view that this is a business that historically is resilient in economic downturns. And if we're looking at a solar economic environment and we're looking at the possibility of recession and we think about where are we most likely to have the stocks and the companies that are most likely to hold up best in that environment? It is some of the defensive sectors, the traditional defensive sectors like staples, the Walmart's healthcare, for example, utilities, another area where we have exposure, even at the same time, even some financials will hold up better regional banks. There'll probably be some evidence of weakening loan demand and some pick up in credit quality issues, but we think that they're in a very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,33,2022-10-10 16:17:08
2920," very strong position with good credit statistics today and with very strong capital positions today. So there are several defensive sectors that we have exposure to, that we think these are sectors. It won't mean that they won't feel any pressure from a slowing economy, but rather that they will be more resilient in the face of a challenging market environment. Just trying to tie both inflation and employment together because one of that is an input cost into the prices that consumers are having to pay as well. For consumers and of course everybody who's in this economy and is working, there's still money that is going out the door out of your pockets both on a necessity basis or on a discretionary basis. So with that in mind, where then are we going to expect to see kind of wages stabilized at the same time that the Fed is trying to see inflation stabilized? Well, Fed is clearly trying to get inflation down and trying to get a way to growth down. And what that really means, even though they don't like to say it so much out loud is they need the unemployment rate to go up and they need jobs growth to slow pretty dramatically. So, but you're right, this implies pressure on the consumers. So there'll be pressure on the consumer in terms of weaker jobs growth. There'll be more people unemployed. There's more pressure on consumer pocketbooks because of inflationary pressures what people are paying at the pump for gasoline with their energy bill when they get their kind bill every month. So there's pressure on the consumer. This is all part of the narrative of an economy that is being forced to slow down by Fed policy. John, if I'm correct, you have some exposures to some big cap tech names, an Apple, Microsoft, and IBM, even a Broadcom, but in light of this AMD warning, which is pretty shocking. I mean, I missed their expectations by a billion dollars on sales are even trying to rotate out of big cap tech or you're gonna just try to just survive this volatility. Well, you know, the truth is, in the strategy that I help run, tech is a significant underweight for us. We actually have a hard time finding tech names that fit the characteristics that we see. We're looking for companies that have growing cash, that will pay attractive growing dividends and otherwise use cash to distribute to shareholders through share buybacks. So we do have exposure to some of those tech names that you mentioned, but we are underweight. We're underweight those names that are kind of by definition underweight Apple. Apple's over 4% of the index. So while we have Apple in the portfolio, it's an underweight Apple. And while we have tech in the portfolio, it's an underweight to the tech sector. I'm sure there'd be some names that we look at and will probably trim them and maybe even exit them, but there's nothing that we're thinking about doing right this minute. Welcome back. Job growth beating estimates by 8,000 in September as high rates and elevated costs per major US economy. But how will a stronger than expected labor report guide the Fed, all of this percolating through the markets today? Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is joining us now from Washington DC. And the Secretary, great to see you as all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,34,2022-10-10 16:21:21
2921," The Fed, all of this, percolating through the markets today. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is joining us now from Washington, D.C., Mr. Secretary, great to see you as always. And so this number showing growth today in places like labor and hospitality, I'm always curious what you're hearing in your conversations with corporate leaders around the country, where they're having still trouble. Because on the other hand, we're also seeing some industries cut back. Give us a little color as to what you're hearing. Yeah, it really depends on where we are. You know, I think one of the areas when you think about cybersecurity and the tech space, that's where a lot of companies are still growing, some have cut back. So we talk about how do we create programs so we can get people skilled out working with community colleges in particular, working with colleges in the country. And really thinking about what employers are talking about now is not about the job market of right now, but they're talking about participation and anticipated growth in their companies and making sure they have the skill to work for us to be able to keep up with that growth. Mr. Secretary, is it a little surprising that we're still seeing some strong job growth like this and upward revisions to prior months? At the same time, the Federal Reserve is really trying to slow the economy down. Well, when you see the areas that we saw growth in this month, and we saw the hospital industry and medical growth fully recovered from pre-pandemic, you know, you're seeing that a lot of people hiring in those hospitals because there's a lot of electric elective procedures that were put off so they're hiring more people in hospitals. We're seeing an increase in manufacturing, certainly more jobs than pre-pandemic and manufacturing. And I think a lot of that has to do with what happened during the pandemic with supply chain. We're seeing more and more companies want to create more and build more here in the United States. We're seeing the President really focusing on that as well, doing more in the United States. We're seeing in this particular month, we didn't see, we saw actually a decrease in governments hiring around education. That's one number that was low, but companies are still looking for people. You're still hearing it every day. I mean, as you mentioned earlier, I think you might have been Julie saying, some people do eye-cutting back on their employees because they're anticipating what the future might bring, but a lot of companies are still hiring. And so with a cutback on employees yet hiring, also kind of decreasing or decelerating, if you will, what does that spell out for the people who, during the great resignation, had kind of put in that two-week notice and said, I've got another offer somewhere else. I've got a greater offer on the table. Is this still a job hopper's market, or from your perspective, is it something where that is decelerating so much to the point where it's very much shifting and employees should be considering exactly where they make those moves? I still think it's a good market for employees to look at for better opportunities, but I think what's happening is employers are realizing now they have to do a little more to keep their employees. Employers don't want to hire somebody and then have to six months lose them to another place for higher salary or better benefits. So I think employers are starting to, when I go around talking to companies, they're really looking to hybrid work, how does that work? They're looking at opportunities, childcare, and other things to encourage people to come into their companies. And I think companies are adapting to the change in the environment around workers today. And some of the folks we're talking to are saying some of these changes are going to be longstanding, right, that we're seeing a more profound shift in the workforce because of increased flexibility of being able to work from home, because of sort of life decisions people made during the pandemic, maybe some people taking early retirement, et cetera. How is the administration thinking about some of those longer term changes and addressing some of those longer term trends? Well, I think one of the biggest things that President did in the bill back better legislation that didn't go to the Senate, child care paid family leave, sick time medically, all of those issues are very important to families today. And I think a lot of companies, some of them, getting there on their own, but child care is a very complicated issue. And I think that we as a country have to think about, rethink about the way that our child care system works because it's expensive and we're having a high time retaining workers in that industry because we don't pay them enough to take care of our kids. So I think as we think about long term, that's going to be one investment on a federal level, but also on the private sector. So I think, you know, pre-pandemic, we didn't hear about the changes in companies. These companies would change the way they did office space, open areas, things like that. But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future and what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. I'm not my role.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,35,2022-10-10 16:25:54
2922," But I think because of the pandemic, it's made us all really think about the future. And what we're doing here at the Department of Labor, we're working with companies. I don't think I have the right to tell a company how to operate that company. That's not my role. My role is to try and assist them and help with them and share best practices where I can and what other companies are doing. Mr. Secretary, last time we spoke to you about a month ago on jobs day, we're still looking to in analyzing the quiet quitting movement. Now a month later, how big a problem is this in the country? I don't, I mean, I haven't really heard about it from companies. I know that it's being reported in the press. I've talked to a lot of companies in the country and I haven't heard about that. Certainly, that's a concern if it continues on because when people hire people, they expect them to do, you know, a day's work for a day's pay. And I think that that's something that we have to continue and encourage. But when I talk, as I've gone around the country this last month and I've done a lot of trips, no company has approached me on this quiet quitting idea. And Secretary, I want to ask you about the real strike in which you intervened last month and helped avert that strike. That was sort of an 11th hour agreement. I know it was sort of a marathon process, right, of working through it with them. What are some of the lessons learned from that? For example, would you get involved earlier in the future to sort of not have a down to the wire situation? If I'm asked to get involved earlier, I would. Certainly in the potent negotiation, I'm not involved at the table, but I certainly am talking to both sides to make sure that encouraging both sides, and they already asked often encourage them to stay at the table and get this contract done. In the real strike, you know, this was a two-year period that they weren't able to get an agreement where the president had to appoint an emergency board to come up with a P.E.B. They came up with the recommendations and we built off of that. But certainly, you know, I think when you get to that point, there's a breakdown. So I have offered to anybody, anybody who wants, if they want me to get involved, or get us involved. But I think mediation is important as well. If you have two sides that kids can't get to an agreement, my recommendation is try and bring a mediator in. It's not to be me, but bring a mediator in. It's just to keep the conversation moving forward. And Labor Secretary, just while we have you, we do know that President Biden issued a presidential proclamation pardoning federal convictions for simple marijuana possession defenses. These are people that have been barred in some cases from getting back into the workforce because of these convictions and offenses. Where will the Labor Department continue to do work at the state level, even, to ensure that there are opportunities for people to get occupations within the workforce? Yeah, we have to make sure what the president did yesterday is carried out. And too many of the people that have been pardoned by the president yesterday are people of color, and particularly the African-American community. And this has been the challenge in our country for a long time where people were convicted of a minor marijuana offense that had a record. And I commend the president for his actions yesterday and the folks that are out there were going to work with them to make sure that they can get into good employment, that this is not an impediment to their ability to get into the middle class and get a good paying job. U.S. Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, pleasure to have you on the show. And thanks as always for taking the time. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,36,2022-10-10 16:29:51
2923, you you I'm going to be on the business. I'm going to be on the business. Levi Strauss out with the beat on earnings and it's late as quarter over a stronger yours dollar weakness in Europe and ongoing supply and change just rupfions like the jeans giant to cut its outlook. With more on this we have harming Singh Levi Strauss CFO for more on this quarter harming great to get some time with you. Want to go across the pond on Europe. So some I would say some surprising results at a Levi's brand. Good morning. As the quarter progressed it did surprise us. And as you know we have a very strong brand. As you think about the quarter overall our quarter was fairly solid despite all the incremental headwinds who were up 7% in constant currency with BDPS. And the Levi's brand was just to the strongest quarter of the revenue in a decade. And so as you think about our European business you know the weather was fairly warm and the consumer there is under pressure. And so what we did as a collectively as a team is we quickly get up into action and you know looked at discretionary costs. We focus on our direct to consumer business because we have a diversified business model. The parts of the world that are really strong like Asia and Latin America and their resistors strong growth. We also had some supply chain disruptions especially in the US which impacted the business. And so as we thought about the year we said okay let's think about three things that impact the results. One is stronger dollar. The second is supply chain disruptions. And the third is you know softening consumer demand in the western part of the world. But even think of Europe brand. The parts of Europe that were fairly strong UK and Spain you know we're actually countries that grew. I think where we were so far is in Germany and France. The brand still fairly strong you know globally as well as in Europe. When you talk about softening demand harming is there a relative point that you think back to where this period is analogous to? You know I would say you know we've been as a company we've been through you know good times and tough times. And I would say as you think about softening demand you know I was not here in 0809 but you know the financial crisis at that time did have an impact as a company. You know our toughest period was during the pandemic where all our stores were shut for about 90 days and we lost a billion dollars you know just like that. But we've as a management team and I'm really proud of the management team that's been around for a while. We actually geared up into action and said okay how do we manage through the crisis but more importantly how do we emerge stronger and then in 2021 we registered our strongest financial year in a decade. So as we think about you know the next few quarters and as you know if things do tighten that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be thinking about how do we manage through the immediate crisis which is in the near term but as a company and a brand you know we will get out of it and we'll get out of it and we'll get out of it stronger. You know some of you that I invested in June we laid out longer term targets these are what are we call not start targets we still get to and focused in delivering them over the long term.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,37,2022-10-10 16:34:19
2924, yesterday in june we laid out long-term targets these are what are we call not start targets we're still get to and focused in delivering them over the longer term and emerging out of this as a stronger company i mean i appreciate the focus on the longer term i'm i want more shorter term question which is after the inventory bill which i believe was above 40% for the last quarter are you putting things on sale how you guys could planning to clear out that inventory yeah so the inventory bill has you know is something that we have flagged uh... you know externally as well as internally so you know it's intentional uh... in in in a way is basically comprised of three things the for the third of the of the inventory growth is driven by the fact that last year was a very low based tight inventory and the fact that inflation has uh... increase the cost of uh... inventory a third is uh... inventory uh... that is driven by the fact that we're bringing uh... you know because of the longer lead times in supply chain we bring in stuff early and we're getting ready for our e-rp installation in the in quarter two of uh... next year and a third is largely goods in transit to a third of our inventory is called so think the five or once think the five elevens and we can carry that through multiple seasons and so there's no reason to discount that uh... we don't have a lot of obsolete where we do have obsolete we are discounting that so that we can clear it uh... but overall if you think of our gross margins are gross margins and q3 were still you know for a basis points higher than twenty nineteen it did a little relative to last year but that was you know largely driven by foreign exchange a little bit more discounting we do expect the holidays season to have to be a little bit more promotional and we're going to balance growing revenue and discounting because the brands never been this strong and that's you know evidence by the fact that q3 revenues uh... for a livid with the strongest in in in uh... in a decade for quarter three when you acknowledge discounting it's hard not to think about the strongest brands right now needing to move through inventory in ploring some of the promotional elements and so when you think about the percentage of full price that selling versus the percentage of what would actually be did uh... discounted during this period of time through the holiday season even perhaps thereafter as well what does that breakdown really look like to you yeah you know uh... still a lot of what we sell is uh... on a full price basis we had uh... estimated that uh... gross margins uh... in the second half of the year uh... because we'll be selling more uh... below full price you know would be impacted about a hundred for a hundred basis points in quarter three that a little bit more about a hundred thirty hundred forty basis points we build that into a guidance in qqq four but overall we still think we'll end the year uh... at about you know four hundred basis points higher than uh... 2019 and that just evidences the strength of the brand are you are for example uh... which is the average unit retail price in quarter three we still up in the in the mid uh... to high single digit that means pricing that we have taken to offset cost is ticking uh... and our revenues were up slightly i sorry our unit growth was up slightly so overall the brands really strong doctors uh... as we have diversified also grew uh... load double digit and beyond your guys just starting which is open up first uh... store in san amonica in heli and if uh... that uh... you know does well then you know uh... we can add a lot many stores in the active way segment so overall uh... our business is fairly diversified uh... brad and uh... thinking is that we will you know uh... you know move through this uh... promotional environment by ensuring that uh... brand continues brand equity continues to build hey harmy it's a brine here again you know i'm loyal uh... leave eyes consumer uh... but i don't know i don't know if i'm buying these new baggy dad genes uh... that you're bringing to market i i don't know if you realize how how strong i work for this physique and those kinds of the show it off i'll be honest with you and you know uh... the fact is that we're a democratic brand we have something for everybody so if the baggy dad uh... you know jesus,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,38,2022-10-10 16:38:39

So if the baggy dad, you know, Jesus, not what you like to wear, it doesn't fit your style. You can wear the tapered look, you can wear the slimmer look. There is something for you, brunt and for everybody else, across all age demographics, you know, at Levi's. And that's what, you know, we are proud to ensure that every consumer gets what he or she needs. Yeah, brunt, Jesus got to rock the jorts to show off the gas. He's got to show off the leg. Oh, you know, look, I'm still the steamy skinny jeans guy. I mean, you got to show off the glutes. You put that time in. I want to show him off on a nice pair of jeans. I don't know. I don't know. There's a little out of fashion here, so we'll take this offline. We'll take this offline. Harmi, it's great to see you. It's not only jeans that you can get from Levi's. You can get more if I had to tell look. You know, I'm wearing a wonderful Levi's shirt, you know, gives a casual look. Because we continue to bleed those who are becoming more casual. And those becoming more casual brands like us that offer more of a head to toe look, you know, are the ones that will eat the judge. Yes, no matter which of the numbers of the models that you wear on the bottom, I have to say we were expecting either the leather jacket or the jean jacket, Harmi, so it's good to know you're still repping on top with the white shirt. Harmi, it's saying great for catching up with the Levi's Strauss CFL. Thanks, Julie. Thank you. And we want to continue the labor market discussion and conversation. Check on the roads ahead for the US economy. And for that, we have Gus Vosher, joining us now, PNC Financial Services Group Chief Economist. And let me just ask you your initial reaction to the report, Gus, and then anything that sticks out to you. Yeah, so this is a good report. The Fed wants to see slower job growth. I think they prefer to even see even slower job growth than this, but certainly we have seen job growth slow over the course of 2022 is the Fed has raised rates. And that should allow the labor market to cool off as we head into 2023. All right. And then we were just listening to it. And as give some of the statistics, so when you dig into the report, some of the demographic breakdowns may surprise people, maybe some reversals and trends, what did you pick out? Well, certainly we saw the labor force participation rate decline. That's bad news from the Fed's perspective. They want to see more people looking for work. Instead, we saw fewer people. And so that means a tight labor market. And so that makes it more difficult for the Fed means they may have to raise rates a bit more. On the other hand, we did see a bit softer wage growth down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is where we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,39,2022-10-10 16:42:58
2926," down to, it slowed to 5% year over year, still higher than the Fed would like, but that's moving in the right direction. So what I think is we are seeing a cooling off in the labor market, but it remains too hot from the Fed's perspective, and they're going to need to raise rates more to cool off some of those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy right now. And I've heard some economists calling this report a Goldilocks report. You look at the stock reaction definitely to the downside, but maybe that's the bad news as good news here, because the Fed doesn't want to see stock prices go up as some of the, I believe it was, Nian Kowkari said definitively over a month ago, what are we to make of this in light of the bad news as good news as bad meme, that kind of confuses people, especially some of us in the business sometimes? Yeah, so what we want is job growth that is slowing to a more sustainable pace. So, you know, even over the last three months, we've added about 370,000 jobs per month on average, the labor force just simply can't support that. So we need to see much slower job growth that's consistent with underlying growth in the population. We're not there yet, we're moving in the right direction. So, you know, obviously if we're adding a lot of jobs in the economy, that means more income, that means more consumer spending, but at the same time it's contributing to high inflation. So, what we want is okay news from the job market, not good news, but, you know, indications that job growth is slowing and that, you know, we are reaching an equilibrium where those wage pressures in the economy are lessening. And how about the other part of the Fed's mandate inflation? So we have maximum employment, stable prices, interpreted to mean 2% inflation, obviously far above that. But what are you expecting out of some of the readings? And how does that fit into the expectations? Everybody waiting with baited breath for that eventual Fed pivot? Yeah, no, we are starting to see inflation slow. I think it peaked over the summer. Obviously we've seen a big drop in energy prices, although we'll have to see what happens with the new OPEC production cuts. Wage growth is slowing, so that should help bring down inflation. It's going to be difficult. You know, we probably won't see that 2% inflation until some time in early 2024, but we are moving in the right direction. I think the Fed wants to see both a slowing in the job market and indications that inflation is moving decisively towards 2% before they stop raising rates. I don't think that'll be some time until early in 2023. So, you know, if the Fed is going to be looking at the data as they come in and we need to see that slowing in inflation and slower job growth, if the Fed is going to let up. And you mentioned the energy market before. I'm stirring it at WTI crude prices at above $91 per barrel. And it was about a week or two ago that it seemed to be about $8 fewer than that. And I'm just wondering, what do the current energy prices say to you? There are people hoping that there would be some mitigation to help out the consumers here, but we had OPEC plus step in, reduce their outlook or reduce what they say they're going to pump by 2.1 million barrels per day. They're already in deficit. What are you making of the energy market and its effect on the U.S. economy here? Yeah, so obviously the OPEC production cuts are not good news for oil prices, for inflation in the United States. That being said, a lot of OPEC members were already below their quotas. And so I don't think we're going to see is, you know, that 2.1 barrel per day cut. But I think we're going to get less help on inflation from lower energy prices. But I think the other impacts of the Fed rate hikes in terms of slowing in job growth, the slowing in demand for consumer durables, that type of thing, that will help reduce in those inflationary pressures we're seeing in the economy, even if OPEC keeps production low. Even if lots of ifs in this business here appreciate your insights on this jobs Friday.

2927," you you you say that d the semiconductor industry is one that makes us feel very profitable and productive for three years in a row and then just makes us feel awful in that fourth year and it seems like we are in that fourth year. The specific things that are causing the headwinds this year are threefold. First, there is just enormous pressure on the consumer because of all the inflationary issues because of all the turmoil in Europe because of the lockdowns in China. Secondly, we have the specter of rising rates, which is never good for valuations in high beta, high multiple sector. And then on top of it, as you mentioned, there are some additional restrictions on semiconductor companies in terms of shipping to China and look, China is the largest customer for semiconductors than it's never good to have friction between the largest designer of semis, which is the US and the largest customer. So I think where we are today, when I put it all in the context, is the semiconductor stocks have a way of smelling the turn in the economy, you know, six to nine to 12 months before it happens. So last November, when semiconductor stocks speak, there was no talk of recession. The same way there is no talk of an upturn of the next cycle today. So our assumption is that compare start to get easier for the sector next year and if that is the assumption and if that's the right assumption, we think semiconductor stocks can try and find a bottom sometime in Q4 and meanwhile, the valuations are starting to look very interesting for what's a very profitable industry. So the fact that's interesting just in terms of what you said to expert restrictions and then taking that and coupling that with your predictions, your expectations for this space going into 2023. So it sounds like you view it as a challenge here in the near term, but you don't think it's going to have a significant impact in terms of sales, is that right? Yeah, so let's talk about those restrictions. So first of all, you know, as I mentioned, friction is never good between the largest designer and the largest buyer of semiconductors. But when you take a step back, the majority of chips that are shipped to China are actually for a lot of consumer applications. Therefore, smartphones, therefore PCs, therefore a lot of low end, you know, consumer speakers and so forth, like the largest buyers of semis in China are not supercomputing or military companies. They are companies like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Lenovo, ZTE. So it's not really super computing. In fact, if I take the entire supercomputing and military end-use market for semiconductors globally, it is not more than 5 or 10% of end-of-man.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,41,2022-10-10 16:51:14
2928," really super computing. In fact, if I take the entire super computing and military end use market for semiconductors globally, it is not more than 5 or 10 percent of end demand. And even if you assume half of it is in China, which is a very big number, it still says that there is not more than a 5 percent or so headband. Second point I would mention is that we have to be careful when we use the term restriction. So what is happening is that there is a set of rules that now forces a lot of semiconductor companies to first go and ask for approvals. So they are not actually banned outright from shipping. They have been given this extra step to go and verify that the end customer is not a military end use customer or a super computing customer that might be on an entity list. Which is why we think that yes, it's a headband and it doesn't help when the sector is already facing a lot of the macro pressures. But in terms of specifically this incremental headband, we don't think it's more than 5 to 7 percent incremental. And that too, it's only applied to very specific set of companies. In fact, I want to draw your attention to something that we saw from tourist securities. In talking about Tesla, perhaps being a dark horse when it comes to AI and perhaps arrival for Nvidia, saying that they actually see it obviously though Nvidia is the leader in this space. They see apart the Tesla to build its own business to compete with it. What's your take on perhaps the role that some of these non-traditional chip makers like a Tesla might play in this space? Sure, absolutely. Look, first, when it comes to the field of artificial intelligence, we are still in the first innings. That means if I take all the servers that were shipped in the world in the last year, less than 15 percent of them actually had an AI accelerator in them and the majority of them used an Nvidia product. And then if I couple that with the automotive industry where Tesla participates, the entire automotive industry is only 8 percent of the semiconductor market. So I think we have to keep a lot of these things in context of what the sizes of these markets are. So we really like Nvidia. And the reason is that their specific technology of AI accelerators, it's not just a chip. They're not just designing a chip. They're actually designing a complete end-to-end system and a stack of software and a stack and a big number of developers, actually and a half million developers that have been trained on using this product. So I would say the Tesla use case is a very, very specific one, maybe less than 1 percent of the entire semiconductor industry. But it is a rising tide. Many companies will participate. But we think Nvidia is on a different not-so-different planet, but I think on a different solar system when it comes to the application and the benefits of AI. The Vekarya, always great to get your perspective. A bank of America. Thanks so much for joining us today. Let's stick with the chip makers and what we're seeing play out in the semiconductor space.

2929," The latest company to take advantage of the funding from the Biden administration's $52 billion chips act announcing plans to invest up to $100 billion for a plant in Syracuse, New York. Joining us now is a man who helped us seal that deal. We want to welcome Syracuse, Mayor Ben Walsh to the program. Mayor Walsh, it's great to see you. Congratulations on this historic deal between the city of Syracuse and a micron year. Just talked to us just about the economic implications of this and the opportunity that this presents for your region. Transformational is probably an understatement. We have been working for a long time to prepare our community for this opportunity and this week was historic. So really, immediately, our focus shifts towards what we need to do to be prepared for this opportunity. Clearly, we have to make sure we have the workforce. We're going to see significant investments in housing, but it's very exciting for an older, northeastern industrial city like Syracuse. It is a part of a really amazing comeback story. A story, someday you'll have to write in a book how a small town or at least medium town quarter $100 billion in investment. How do you do it? Because other companies, other towns across the country are watching to see exactly how they can do it. What was the key? Well, there are so many factors that went into it. We have a great site. The site is located about 15 to 20 minutes north of the city of Syracuse owned by the Anadogga County Industrial Development Agency. They've been investing in that site for nearly 30 years now. It is about 1,400 acres now. So we had the right site. We had the support from New York State government, Governor Holt Gold made a significant investment. The CHIP SAC at the federal level was critically important. Right here in the city of Syracuse, we have been in the midst of our own Renaissance. A lot of investment downtown. The city is really coming back and as companies are trying to attract and retain talent, having a vibrant city as a critical component. I'm proud to say we have that here in Syracuse. Up to 50,000 jobs are expected to be created as a result of this. I guess how do you prepare? How do you build up the workforce in order to fill that large number of jobs? Well, it takes time. And I'm pleased to say that we're not starting right now. We've been at this for quite a while now as part of our Syracuse Surge strategy, which is our strategy for inclusive growth in the new economy. As we've identified opportunities in what we call the fourth industrial revolution, we've seen certain areas where Syracuse has a competitive advantage where we have curriculum in our schools that we're developing that can make sure that our people and our workers have the right skill sets. So we have a lot of the right programs and infrastructure in place. This opportunity is just going to require us to scale them at a rate that we've never done before. So, again, looking at scaling our workforce development programs, continuing to invest in housing, public transportation, all of the infrastructure that we need to accommodate this investment. So 9,000 of those jobs should make an average of $100,000 each that is remarkable. As remarkable as this achievement was, I'm inspired by an independent mayor winning 60% of the vote in your second term. Is this something that we can see spread across the country? What allowed you to run as an independent because the narrative in this country is that it is a dominated two-party system and you simply cannot break through? Well, I'll describe it within the context of this deal. The fact that we have an independent mayor, a Republican County executive, a Democratic governor, all working hand in hand to make this deal happen is significant. And I think does provide a model for other communities to pursue at a time when our country is very divisive. I think when people focus on what we have in common and where we can have shared prosperity and growth, you can make things happen. So I hope in that way we are a model that we are where America is going or hopefully we want to be going. And as for me, it was about developing and bringing together a broad coalition, broad diverse coalition of people that had a love for this city and that we're willing to set party politics aside for the greater good. Speaking of being a model, making things happen clearly, this is a huge win for your city. Are you in talks with other large-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,43,2022-10-10 17:00:18
2930," politics aside for the greater good. Speaking of being a model, making things happen clearly, this is a huge win for your city. Are you in talks with other large companies? What else are you doing to attract jobs to your city of Syracuse? Well, similar to the point about our programs in place, you know, our comeback story, our Renaissance, is already underway. We have a facility on the south side of Syracuse just south of downtown, a local company, a JMA wireless, just constructed the first 5G wireless manufacturing facility in the United States. We have other investments like that taking place. Nothing to the scale of micron, and we certainly see, know that there will be significant follow-on opportunities, supply chain opportunities that come with micron. But we do hope that this also puts us on the radar of many other companies around the globe that are looking for a place where, again, you have the political alignment that allows you to do business that has the balance of a vibrant downtown, but also beautiful parks and countrysides and mountains and lakes all around us. So it's really pulling all of that together. Well, congratulations on the deal. Nice to join us, Syracuse, Mayor Ben Walls. Appreciate it, thanks. Thank you. In this episode of influencers, SEC Chair Gary Gensler. I come with a deeply markets background. I really believe in markets. I think markets are critical part of our economy but regulated markets. Events in Eastern Europe just sort of highlight once again the importance of cyber resiliency. If you're raising money from the public, and the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money, that comes within the definitions of a security and the security's laws, and it's kind of straightforward. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Sirware, and welcome to our guest, Gary Gensler, Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gary Gensler was sworn into office as the 33rd Chair last April, and in a little under a year in office, he's pushed the SEC right into the middle of the conversation surrounding cryptocurrency, meme stocks, and other issues as well. Chair Gensler, thanks so much for joining us. Andy, it's so good to be with you and your viewers. Thank you. A whole lot to get to, but I want to start with the news in Ukraine, especially the reaction from the business community, the New York Stock Exchange recently moved to temporarily halt trading for Russia-based companies. Have you been monitoring that and should it be a permanent ban? So just stepping back from any one circumstance, the staff of the SEC are monitoring markets as we do through these times, throughout the whole time that I've been at the agency. It's not just about the geopolitical events in Eastern Europe, but yes, they're monitoring. We're staying close to those events. We're talking to our colleagues at the US Department of Treasurer and across the financial regulatory complex, the Federal Reserve, and other regulators, as well as globally to regulators in the banking and the securities fields across the globe. Just to stay close and monitoring events with these really unusual events out of Eastern Europe and war in Ukraine. Do you feel you have enough transparency into US corporate exposure to Russian assets and the Russian economy? Do you have worries about hidden US connections as the Russian economy may be headed for a recession or worse? Well, Andy, I'm going to stick to our remittance, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is about overseeing yes, a hundred plus trillion dollar cap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,44,2022-10-10 17:04:28
2931," worse? Well, and I'm going to stick to our remittance the securities and exchange commission, which is about overseeing yes, a hundred plus trillion dollar capital markets and ensuring that they're fair and orderly, efficient and in these unusual times we're monitoring for that. But I do feel that we've had good dialogue with major market participants in the fund area, in the broker dealer area, the exchanges, the clearing houses, and at least for these handful of days so far the market functions have been operating relatively well. But what comes tomorrow, what comes in the future we're monitoring against, you know, events as they come? I understand it's not straight ahead into your remit, but obviously as you suggest yourself, there are implications potentially and potential even systemic risks to the global macro system. One last question here, Chair Gensler, about that though, are there other actions the SEC is taking or considering taking in response to what's going on in Ukraine and Russia? Again, we're staying alert and monitoring, we're staying close with the rest of the financial stability oversight council agencies and our colleagues around the globe. If you look at funds under management, the total multiples of tens of trillions of dollars of assets under management here in the US, only a very small percentage. Well, measured well below 1%, in fact only a fraction of 1% are invested in Russian securities or ADR is traded overseas and things like that. So yes, we're going to continue to monitor, especially stay alert for any cyber risks or any other market functioning risks. But I think that's what our role is and then to ensure for our three-part mission investor protection capital formation and then that in the middle, the fair orderly and efficient markets. Okay, sounds good. Let me ask you about crypto, which is part of your purview, I guess, increasingly and something you've been considering a lot lately. I know last time you were on with Yahoo Finance, the prospects for a spot Bitcoin ETF came up and you had a lot of questions about how investor protection would work there. Have your concerns been alleviated? Is approval coming, do you think? Look, we at the SEC are technology neutral, but we're anything but public policy neutral. And so this investment class, a little less than two trillion dollars of assets, valuation in crypto currencies, if you wish, or crypto tokens, Bitcoin and all the other tokens is a highly investible asset at this point in time. Many tens of millions of people around the globe have chosen to put some of their savings into this space. And so it's every bit is important to have investor protection for crypto exchanges, for the lending platforms where people are transacting, buying and selling crypto tokens, and have appropriate disclosure about the tokens themselves and protect the public from fraud and manipulation. And that's really what we're looking at. And yes, as you said, the SEC has a role to play. Other agencies do as well, but the SEC has a role to play because Congress painted with a broad brush. And if you're raising money from the public, and the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money, that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities law.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,45,2022-10-10 17:08:41
2932," And the public's anticipating some profit based on the efforts of those folks raising the money that comes within the definitions of a security and the securities laws and it's it's kind of straightforward. Congress saw that that was an opportunity to mislead the public to to sell to sell a shame transaction to that the public could make a decision the basic bargain the public gets to decide on their investments as long as those promoters raising money are giving full and fair disclosure. And there's basic laws about protecting against fraud in essence lies about what's going on. Right, and then sort of following up there and you also told us that you hope this this year crypto trading exchanges would come within the public policy perimeter. Yeah, look, we had just a couple of weeks ago working with one of the larger lending platforms where where a platform was taking money in. It's it's public is block by 600,000 or so. Retail accounts and institutional accounts people putting their crypto assets at risk with block five block five then saying we'll give you a return on an in an on an account. And we were trying to bring those parties in in that case that was a you know they were not following the securities laws the securities laws investment company laws and the securities act laws. So does that mean though that the exchanges will come under SEC regulation strictly speaking. Just just do a little bit of probability here i'm sort of a math guy I was when I was a kid my identical twin brother and I you know that's that's kind of who we were and everything but. These platforms often have not just dozens but hundreds or thousands of tokens on their platforms and these tokens back to the securities laws many of them without pre judging any one of them many of them may well be securities. Probabilities or that these platforms there's 10 or 15 large platforms these crypto trading platforms have 75 to 5000 tokens on probabilities or they have securities on our laws are straightforward supposed to register as an exchange where people are buying and selling those securities and yes. Many tokens many crypto tokens have been found in the past to be securities i'm not trying to prejudge any one token with probability weighted there are many of these tokens on these platforms. you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,46,2022-10-10 17:12:46
2933," you you you there thank you for attending Call His Check Tower of is in exchange, it's question whether they're registered or they're operating outside of the law, and I'll leave it at that. Are you concerned, Chair Gensler, about the decrease in the number of public companies in the US? And I know there's arguments about how extreme that decrease is, and nonetheless, if you were today and there were 20 years ago. And then the fact that private companies grow into Deca Unicorns and are great investments, perhaps, but they're unavailable to ordinary investors. They're only available to the people on Sand Hill Road and how that might be exacerbating inequality in this country. So I think that we have vibrant capital markets, it's a hundred plus trillion dollar capital markets that are kind of the envy of the world, frankly. I think anyone who's honored to be in the role of the common, as you said, Andy, the 33rd Chair, and there'll be others, you know, for decades to come in this great agency. Well, central to our roles, this Chair's, past Chair's and future Chair's, is to ensure that we continue to be the envy of the world, that we have the leading capital markets. And we have a vibrant public capital markets and vibrant private markets. We are taking up a lot of projects here at the SEC about those private markets to bring greater transparency, greater efficiency. We have more efficiency and yes, competition in the middle, that's better for those private companies, whether they're small startups or the unicorns. And it's better for the investor. So we're trying to drive efficiency in the middle. We're also trying to drive for greater transparency, particularly as it relates to financial stability risk, emanating maybe out of hedge funds and the like. So we've got a lot of projects driving competition and transparency, but part of our markets is both public markets and private markets. Speaking of the envy of the world, what is the future of Chinese stocks listing in the United States? Does the SEC have a role or a position in this situation one way or the other? So we do so we're blessed in the US again with such robust and strong capital markets that between 1,500 foreign companies actually live.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,47,2022-10-10 17:17:25
2934," So we're blessed in the US again with such robust and strong capital markets that between 1,500 foreign companies actually list their shares here in the US. It's not just China companies but a lot of Europeans Asian South American African Australian company. It just from all around the globe. But there's some basic understandings that if you want to list in the US, you need to comply with our investor protection rules. And one of the key things that came out 20 years ago. One of the key things was that if you want to be issuing and raising money in the US, that you have to be not only audited that the company has to be audited, but the auditors have to be open to inspection. Kind of simple idea, audit the auditors and Paul Sorbaine's a Maryland Senator who I had the honor to work with chairs sorbaine's past that law 20 years ago by partisan with Republicans on the hill, which Senator with Mike Oxley and with President Bush. 20 years later, 50 plus jurisdictions around the globe have allowed US entity called the public company accounting oversight board to audit the auditors, but China has not. So Congress weighed in again two years ago or year and a half ago and said, no, that's not that's not right. And they put a clock that had to happen. So where are we today. I think it's really we've had some good discussions with our counterparts from China, the public company accounting oversight board has had some good discussions, but it's really up up to the officials in China. So now the auditing firms and Beijing and Shanghai and elsewhere to be inspected and that their work papers are actually shared and not with a lot of red actions, but actually shared. And the auditors actually allowed themselves to be, you know, give interviews and testimony like 50 other countries have done right then there's a path forward otherwise Congress has spoken about 250 Chinese companies in this three year clock. And potentially as early as 2024 would be would have to suspend trading here. Another proposal on the works is specifically in response to last year's meme stock craze, I believe it would shorten the amount of time it takes to clear trades. How would last year have played out differently had that rule been in place. And events around the meme stops or as you know, the game stop led to a review by the SEC and we came up the staff came up with four areas we should take a look at. And we have in two of those areas put out proposals to we've working on some more. So one is what you talked about is the basic plumbing. Shortening how long it takes for money to move and stock to move it's called settlement period from two days to one day we've also done something around transparency around short selling and made a proposal. Last week around that as well. Shortening the settlement cycle lowers the risk in the system is the old saying goes time is money right now if you do a trade on a Monday you don't move the money or the stock until Wednesday. You shorten that to Tuesday less risk in the middle of that January the faithful January around the game stop events the broke a number of broke one line brokers and broker jobs said we can't let retail public access the market and that's that's just that access to the market is so fundamental. That part of the issue part of the issue was the settlement cycle thing but it's not the only thing and as I say we have four projects we.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,48,2022-10-10 17:21:38
2935," that part of the issue, part of the issue was this settlement cycle thing, but it's not the only thing. And as I say we have four projects we propose to the other two looking at really the equity market structure itself and payment for order flow and the dark. And then we have the same pool of capital that are flowing without transparency. That's a major project that I'm hoping staff will make recommendations and we'll move forward. And lastly was this thing called gamification or what we've come to call digital engagement practices. The journal is reported the SEC is looking in recent sales by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his brother Kimble whether they violated insider trading rules. I know you can't comment on a post. I'm glad you said that. I'm not sure where you're heading. I'm going somewhere. I'm going somewhere chair against her. All right. I know you can comment on possible investigation, but have you talked about the need for stronger insider trading rules generally how big an issue is this been your first year is insider trading a problem that you're focusing on. It is it is from our enforcement side or terrific enforcement efforts headed up by director of gray wall. Sanjay Wadwa the whole team just terrific team, but it's also from from the policy side we've even done something about insiders. When can corporate executives sell their shares and there was something put in place about 20 years ago, which was called a safe harbor if you might and we came on board and thought there's too many gaps in this area that the insin your management might be trading stock. And there in receipt of material non public information and we put this proposal out in I think was December or so about these so called 10 B51 plans and so both from really vigorous enforcement. Also from the policy side about insiders were taking it up in both ways and I think it's a really important part because it comes out of trust in our capital markets and and trust that there's a level playing field that when you're in the markets that that somebody doesn't have an information and banage from material non public information. you you you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,49,2022-10-10 17:25:42
2936, you you you you you you what are your feelings about the debate on Capitol Hill right now about lawmakers being able to trade stocks my understanding is the SEC that SEC employees have pretty tight restrictions with some stocks being off limits and trades needing to be pretty approved is that fair I mean should it be the same for everyone in all different branches of the government but I'm going to leave that as you can imagine to Congress to think through or certainly or willing and able to give them technical assistance on that the stock act that was passed about 10 years ago by Congress and set certain reporting obligations on members of Congress and also certain limitations as well we as an agency actually have a role to play in that stock act and that's that's ongoing discussions I know up on Capitol Hill and wherever they come out we stand ready to help implement our part of that if they change those laws and finally chair Gansler other recent SEC chairs including Jake Clayton and Mary Jo White came to the job for more of a legal background that you worked as a banker at Goldman once upon a time ago how has that background and the insight you garnered there changed how you approach these issues and running the commission is it any different well I'm honored to be in this job I mean that the then president elect Biden as many to it is one of the greatest honors of my life you know right up there with my three daughters I guess but my three daughters maybe higher honor and the wonderful woman I was was married to I would say this I'm the fifth chair of those 33 that is a non-murder you know from from the first chair Joe Kennedy the president Kennedy's father Arthur Levin William Donaldson some really really fantastic chairs look we all come with different backgrounds different perspectives at different experiences I'm I come with a deeply markets background I really believe in markets I think markets are a critical part of our economy but regulated markets I think that the the laws put in place in the 1930s in this eight nine decade period of the SECs that would Franklin Dylan Roosevelt laid out and and many really wonderful people at the SEC and on Capitol Hill too have augmented is we've enhanced economic growth because when you enhance trust is basic concept that if you investors get to decide but they get full and fair disclosure and we protecting them against fraud that the exchanges have to register but there's a basic rules of investor protection and this three part mission to facilitate capital formation investors in the efficient markets in the middle I think that's a really great bargain now for me I've also had the great honor to chair and I'm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,50,2022-10-10 17:30:03
2937," efficient markets in the middle. I think that's a really great bargain. Now for me, I've also had the great honor to share another agency, so along with Mary Shapiro, Mary and I, or two people that have shared both the commodity futures trading commission and the SEC. So it's great to talk to my former chairs. There's eight, I think of eight or nine now that are still alive and I call them on a regular basis. I check in. And there's just a terrific, terrific group of commissioners, my fellow commissioners, Alison Lee, Hester Perst and Caroline Crenshaw. And we all bring a little bit different skills and perspective and we bring it together. Eric Gensler, Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirware. We'll see you next time. Welcome back to Yowl Finance on this Monday morning. I'm Brian Sasi alongside Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. Markets or mix, this trader's gear up from Porton Reads on inflation this week and the start of earning season with results out of the big banks. You've seen some mixed action across the board. The Dow slightly in the green. Now here are three things we're watching for you at this moment. On high alert for a recession, we'll talk one economic expert on the road ahead for the sputtering U.S. economy. And DC heats up. Yowl Finance contributor Kevin Sirly stops by ahead of the annual World Bank and IMF meetings later this week. And a key great recession player wins some new hardware for his trophy shelf. We'll have the details coming up shortly. Now let's get over to Yowl Finance as an S for A over the Wi-Fi Interactive. And Sasi, we are looking at a mixed picture when it comes to equities. The bottom market today is closed. But the NASDAQ is the one that is really under pressure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,51,2022-10-10 17:34:46
2938," We are looking at a mixed picture when it comes to equities. The bottom market today is closed, but the NASDAQ is the one that is really underperforming right now down to 6.10% of a percent. That's because technology stocks are under pressure, so you can see tech here under pressure, healthcare and consumer discretionary as well. Over on the NASDAQ 100, we are watching a little bit of flatness when it comes to Amazon, Tesla, up about 7, 10% of a percent, and Apple, down about 1%. Do you want to point out what's happening with the Chinese ADRs? Because we are seeing some of these Chinese ADRs under pressure. And this is because of some holiday-shopping data, also because of COVID cases in China. So that's putting pressure on these Chinese stocks and also putting pressure on some of the gambling stocks as well. So just looking at our gambling chart, we are seeing some of these casinos and win resorts that are under pressure as well as some of the travel stocks guys. All right, Yahoo! Finance is on the NASDAQ. Thanks for breaking that down for us. Appreciate it. And as we continue to look ahead to what's on tap this week with the Fed Minutes and CPI data, let's bring in the co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, Lakshman to Truthin to break it down. Lakshman, always a pleasure to speak with you and get some of your insights. How was T-Up this week? I mean, we've got a ton of data, of course. Last week was the big kind of employment reading across the board from private pay rolls all the way into some of the Joltz data that we had seen, even though that's lagging a little bit more. And of course, the Monthly Jobs report. What is that setup for what the Fed is also going to be tracking on pricing more broadly this week and what consumers are actually paying? Great question. And thank you for having me. Good morning. And Jobs Data, CPI data this week, Jobs Data last Friday, CPI data this week. Those are all what we would call from a cyclical kind of monitoring point of view, coincident data. And the Fed has declared for many years, it's kind of what got us into this pickle in the first place that they're going to be tracking coincident data in order to figure out what to do. And every once in a while, you'll hear that their data dependent. And that's a little bit of of a nine into that view. And so we look at the Jobs Data. It was a pretty good report on the face of it. Your year of year, Jobs Growth actually is trending down. It's about a year and a half low in the growth rate. So cyclically, we know it's direction we're going in. But the jobless rate at a half century low, three and a half percent on the face of it, that's hawkish, more hawkish Fed. It's not what they want to see at this point. They need more weakness in the labor market and they've said that in various ways. And then when you look to the CPI, coincident inflation data this week, probably too sticky, probably too hot. Our cyclical view, right, forward looking cyclical view, is that actually the peak is in, right? And a cyclical peak has already happened in inflation. We are trending down. The problem is that it's going to be very sticky. You might get some relief in the pace of goods related inflation. But the services side, where most of the spending happens, including rents, for example, very, very sticky. And as a result, I in the earlier segment, the point was made that, you know, core is going to be sticky. They're looking at core coincident inflation. So again, kind of a hawkish, you know, angle to the Fed, trying to make up for the earlier mistake of missing the inflation cycle upturn, continuing to slow the economy. So, Lakshman, you talked about where we are in the inflation cycle. What about where we are in the overall economic cycle, right? Because what we've been hearing from guests as of late is the tenor has started to shift a little bit from being pretty darn confident that it was going to be a mild recession if we get one to maybe leaning a little bit more into, well, maybe it's going to be a little bit more severe than we thought. Thanks. Excellent question. And I, this is how we edge into the realization that, yes, there's a recession. And markets are, and analysts can be kind of manic-depressive, right? So they'll be like, no, it's not happening, and all of a sudden, as it becomes more obvious that something's afoot, they can overdo it and get more extreme the other side. Our analysis is that, yes, there is going to be a recession, to be clear.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,52,2022-10-10 17:39:22
2939," So, foot, they can overdo it and get more extreme. The other side, our analysis is that, yes, there is going to be a recession. To be clear, we will need to see job losses for there to be a recession. Also, to be clear, there have been several instances, historically, where recessions begin before job losses begin. One of the more extreme examples would be the 73, 75 recession, which was a very severe recession, which began and then jobs actually kept growing for eight months until you actually saw jobs to start negative. So, the recession itself began a little bit earlier. This is getting into the weeds about how recessions are determined. And we may be seeing some of that here because it was so hard to find the people that you needed to work, that businesses are very reluctant to let them go. Even when they're starting to see difficulty on earnings and you were saying in the earlier segment, also I was watching about how this earnings kind of recession feeling is coming in. And FedEx, for example, is just like, forget it, we can't even say anything. It's a global recession. And we don't know what's going to happen. And global recessions, to be fair, they are more severe than your kind of garden variety of recession. So, I think that's a reasonable thing to be thinking about in your scenario planning. Do you think the economy next year will start shedding jobs like you mentioned? Yes. Look, if we're right and there's a recession, and I think that we are correct here, then by definition there must be job losses. The question will be how much structurally there's a lot of issues in tightness in the labor market so that may limit it to some degree. We have seen, as I mentioned, in that inflationary kind of 70s period where the nominal numbers look pretty good, the businesses were slow to let people go. I mean, it's very, very expensive to hire someone and then let them go. You have to train them up and then you have to let them go. That's the last thing you want to do as a business manager so I understand why that is. And they're hopeful. Certainly you see all the time. There's a lot of hope in them. You use that, I was watching everything this morning. You're using the hope in more this morning. And there's a lot of this comes up in the market talk. Oh, maybe they're going to pivot. Maybe they're going to be able to sell. I don't think that's going to happen. But that kind of talk probably is keeping some of the jobs growth going too. Lachman, how does the Fed then react to all of this, right? There's the talk of pivot has faded away a little bit. Yeah. But at some point, do we see the Fed sort of quickly trying to backpedal here and fix some of the economic damage that it looks like that the policy could cause? Yeah, I mean, I think that we wrote at the beginning of the year in January, we wrote that they had a choice of two mistakes, right? Meaning that they either had to take a recession or they had to let inflation run out of control. Overleaf simplistic. And they've chosen the recession. So the intention is the pain. That is the goal. And I think Powell said as much in one of the Q&A things a week or two ago. And so will they go too far? I mean, in the sense that there'll be a recession, I think, yes. And they, I think, believe that they have the tools to counterman that at some point and ease up on the tightening. But by their own definition, they're saying that they want to see the pace of core CPI growth, depending on various measures of looking at it. Drop down. And by all the analysis and the now casting that we're hearing, this week's CPI is still going to be sticky. And we think we understand why it's probably more in the services side that it'll be sticky. But the Fed is saying if it's sticky, we're going to stay the course. And that's not what the market wants to hear. So we probably have this slower grinding. And again, you had mentioned earlier, it's tempting because prices are down to start to look for bargains, longer term bargains. But you're going to have to accept a lot of volatility, because this chapter isn't over yet. OK, so with that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,53,2022-10-10 17:43:40
2940," to start to look for bargains, longer term bargains, but you're going to have to accept a lot of volatility because this chapter isn't over yet. Okay, so with that in mind, and also given that you've studied previous economic cycles, we know that the markets try to price in the risk of a recession well ahead of time, but what would that bottom out period look like in relative to now, relative to the declines that we've already seen over the course of 2022, and when might we see that bottom? Hard to say magnitude wise, right? So if it's a global recession and odds are high, I think of that, it could be more severe. So the recognition of that may be mean some more downside volatility. The question of then is where else do you put your money in? It's hard to figure that out. So there's a lot of maybe this isn't the worst place even though it's going down. These bigger recessions, you could see larger retransments in equity prices than we've seen so far. So that's totally in the cards. The relationship between equities and business cycles, business cycle recessions is that they do tend to sniff out the recovery before the bottom of the recession by a few months. And I have no reason to believe this cycle wouldn't be different. Looking at other leading indicators of non equity related leading indicators, it doesn't look like the bottom is in sight yet. And so that's why we were very suspicious of the soft landing bottoming narrative that developed a few months ago. I think that the S&P was like in 3600 right around there, 3660. And it was like, that's it. We're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. We could see across the valley. And of course, that was premature. I think we have another light down here. It sounds like that is indeed what we call a head fake. Blacksman, Atrethan, economic cycle research institute, co-founder, always good to see you. Have a good rest of the week. Nice to see you too. Thank you. All right, before we had to break, let's highlight some cautious analysis on IBM by Marcus down these Eric Woodring. Head of its October 19th earnings report, notably Woodring expects IBM to miss consensus margin estimates says Woodring. In a note, decline. We see downside two street margins and reduce our margin estimates as we expect cost pressures to persist in the 3Q. Most of those margin pressures are seen coming from IBM's consulting and infrastructure businesses. Coming up, former Fed share, Ben Bernanke is a big winner today, and we're going to be Julia's back with today's top headlines next.

2941," neglected Here are some of the other headlines that we are watching at this hour, at least 11 or dead and 60 injured in Ukraine this morning. After Russia launched its biggest widespread assault on the country since the start of its invasion, this comes after Vladimir Putin accused the country of attacking a critical bridge to Crimea and promised a harsh, responsive, key of where to conduct further terrorist attacks, his words on Russian territory. Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky says Russia wants, quote, panic and chaos, he cited attacks on the country's electrical grid and other civilian infrastructure. Former US Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke and two other US economists Douglas Diamond and Philip Dibvig were recognized by the Nobel, Nobel panel at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today. The three economists sharing the Nobel Prize for their research into the fallout from bank failures. The panel said the trio's research, quote, significantly improved the understanding of the role of banks and why avoiding bank collapses is vital. Credit Tweet shares extended their rally to a third day after Bloomberg reported that bidders are lining up for the bank's Securitized Products Unit. That's a key pillar in the downsizing of its investment banking operations. A sale of that unit could prove an additional catalyst for the bank, which recently offered to buy back up to $3 billion of its own debt. That's it. It's a busy week down in DC highlighted by the annual IMF and World Bank meetings. Yeah, we'll find it's contributor. Kevin Surley has some analysis for us on these events. Kevin, what's on your radar screen? T minus 30 days until the midterm elections. This week we're going to get two crucial debates that really could be indicative not just of what's happening in Ohio and in Georgia, but the broader country as a whole in Ohio, the late night Senate, JD Vance, the Maga Republican, challenging former Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan. Remember, he ran for president last cycle as well. This is a debate that is going to be the first of two for them leading up to the midterm elections, but let's not forget that early voting has started in multiple states. And now it is when voters are going to be paying more careful attention. And then of course down in Georgia, Rafael Warnock, the Democrat governor incumbent challenging being challenged rather by her show Walker. Now he of course has been plagued by a series of allegations that he denies a cheap among them that he advocated for his former girlfriend to have an abortion. Walker has made being anti abortion part of his platform. So this is really the first time and potentially the last time where these two politicians and the Georgia governor race will come face to face. And mind you, this comes at a time when abortion has risen to the top of the polls as to what Democrats are paying attention to. But this debate really could reverberate outside of Georgia. A lot of folks paying attention to what's going on there. Yeah, indeed. A lot of eyes on that state and the race there, Kevin. Also, we got to talk about jobs and how the recent jobs report that impacts Thursday's inflation print as well. Well, precisely, and not just what happened with the jobs report, record low unemployment rate 50 year low 3.5%. But juxtaposed with what happened with OPEC, that has many economists worried that inflation in the United States might continue to rise as consumers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,55,2022-10-10 17:52:17
2942," But juxtaposed with what happened with OPEC, that has many economists worried that inflation in the United States might continue to rise as consumers face more pain at the pump. But while abortion has risen to the top of issues that Democrats are paying careful attention to amongst independent voters and Republicans, it's all about the economy. And that's why the inflation report coming on Thursday, the final report ahead of the midterm elections will be so incredibly crucial and carefully watched that this is something of an economy rather that both parties that strive to seize upon. Democrats saying that there's record low unemployment, but of course Republicans looking at inflation and saying that it's a sign that we're heading even further into a recession. And then finally, you're watching the January 6th Committee and this I guess also has implications going back to the first item you're watching the midterms potentially. When can we look for the January 6th Committee's report? Nobody knows, Jules. I mean, that's what I mean, truthfully, I mean, I'll be honest, I was just talking to folks yesterday and really that's the biggest question here is, all right, now we're having another hearing. It's going to be in the afternoon. CBS News released a poll just a couple of weeks ago ahead of this hearing where they found something like 31% of folks who have been paying attention to this say that this is going to make them more likely to vote Republican 40% who are following the hearing say it's going to make them more likely to vote for Democrats. But the timing of the release of this report and the expectation here in the beltway is that this is the final hearing ahead of the midterms. That's going to be incredibly, incredibly watched if it's after the midterms, which is looking like potentially what it could be. How will that T up 2024 candidates who are looking to launch their campaigns will be watching? Kevin's really, yeah, who finances own joining us here to really discuss and break down where we're watching in the beltway and beyond. Well, Kevin, appreciate it. Anytime, thanks guys. Definitely coming up. Why are next guests says that continue to uncertainty in the UK in Europe will cause the US dollar to remain strong. We're going to discuss that next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,56,2022-10-10 17:56:32
2943," The strong dollar might be here to stay as war and uncertainty in Europe and the UK abroad make the USA comparatively better place to invest. This plus a spendy consumer here at home could mean inflation is set to remain higher for longer for more. Let's bring in Joseph Lewis, who is the Jeffers head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Joe, great to have you here with us today. First and foremost, we've already heard a lot of tech companies, especially really give their insight or at least forecast into how much FX headwinds would continue to impact them. Is it going to be in par or in line with or even greater than what they anticipated? So the first things to remember about companies and how they think about foreign exchanges that it's an averaging process, right? So what you see immediately today will take some time to flow through their earnings. I think what you'll expect is that if the dollar continues to be strong, which is generally the expectation, you're going to see this show up probably Q1, Q2 next year, as the move recently has been so quick that companies haven't had the time for that to flow completely through the income statement. Look, we're telling companies that I spend most of my days doing is to give people advice around strong dollars probably here to stay. I think you summed it up correctly, which is when you think about your alternatives, the UK, Europe, Asia, the U.S. continues to make a ton of sense in terms of where people want to keep assets going forward. So Joseph, you said that your employing things are going to get worse because the dollar keeps on going up and there's a delayed effect. This is what companies do, right? They hedge currencies, whether they're going up, they're going down. This is part of their operations. As you said, you helped them do that. What is it about this current environment that is so tricky for them? Is it the speed of the move in the dollar, the persistence of it? Is there something unique about this point in time? Well, it's two parts, right? I think it's the speed. And then what you have is the persistence, right? And I think for companies, the hard part right here is companies are hedging six to 12 months out. They're managing for a year at most 18 months for the companies that are a little bit more aggressive. And so the decision to make is if I go and hedge now, go and lock in what is potentially a problem that may bounce back, right? And so the hardest part for companies right now is to really determine will this persist? And when you have this discussion back and forth about there's going to be a recession in the US which probably could mean the dollar could weaken. It's hard for companies to make decisions, right? You can take 10 economists and you've probably had two or three people on. They'll say slightly different things have slightly different forecasts. And I think that's been really challenging for my clients is sort of there is a consistency in view. And a lot of times the views have changed so rapidly, right? Six months ago the view was very different than it is today. And so, you know, it's summing up. I think it's just hard for companies to make decisions in this market when you have this much volatility. And you know, the outcome is so determined, really not by fundamentals, but really by policy. Joe, what sectors are doing a good job of hedging in this environment? Well, it's funny. I would say, you know, I wouldn't say some sectors. I think it's the size of companies that are doing better. The larger companies just have much more developed policies. They're just doing more. They've got a history of hedging. They've just been global longer. I think it's the new companies that over the last five, 10 years have seen rapid growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,57,2022-10-10 18:01:05
2944," of hedging they've just been global longer. I think it's the new companies that over the last five, 10 years have seen rapid growth. That growth has been faster than their ability to put policy in place, right? So I wouldn't say it's a sector, right? I think it's, I would say companies that are seeing meteoric growth over the last 10 years are probably a little bit behind the April. The companies that have been global for 10, 20 years tend to be, tend to have policies and tend to be managing effects already. Smaller companies are also a little bit troubling, right? Because they, yeah, for them, they're still growing, right? And you kind of want to grow and then have hedges in place. So I would say, you know, companies that are big and have grown rapidly recently and smaller companies, those are the companies I probably worry the most about. And so with the size of those companies that you're really studying across and researching around, it also comes down to their employee base in all of these countries too. What role does the workforce, the employment and the wages across those different entities? What does that play as well in some of the effects considerations? Look, if you can have earnings and costs locally, that's your best outcome, right? So if I can sell my goods in a country and hire locally, that gives me costs to offset revenue. The companies that have the most issues will tend to be companies that have a lot of intellectual capital in one country and then sell goods in the other. So think about tech. Well, if all your programmers are in one country but you're selling goods globally, you don't actually have costs to offset. So companies are starting to think about that, right? How do I create natural offset? Where do I want to have my labor force, capital to offset some of my effects risk? That's the ideal situation. Most companies aren't set up that way. They tend to have what you tend to find, and you look at a tech sector, you tend to have a lot of costs in the US, for the US companies and a lot of net income overseas. And so that's always a challenge. Joe, bottom line, what do you think the magnitude of the effect of stronger dollars going to be in terms of the hit to US corporate earnings? I get the benefit, I would say, of not having to look and try to estimate that. The answer's far. That's a very hard question. Because companies man it, and when you think about the market, right? The largest companies that dominate the S&P into Dow, they have FX policies in place, right? And so I think overall, it's probably bigger than people are going to expect. And companies will come out and tell you, they'll say on a constant currency basis, we are X, but I wouldn't have an exact number, but I would say is I do probably if this persistence next year, it's probably going to be larger people expect. Good analysis here. Joseph Lewis, Jeffrey's head of corporate hedging and FX solutions. Have a good rest of the week. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Coming out, Netflix stands to mint money from its new ad tier servers who has some calls of the day. Coming up next week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,58,2022-10-10 18:05:21
2945," My Welcome back. Let's fire off a few calls on the day on this Monday morning. I'm locking in on a good note at a JP Morgan on Netflix. Another note out here explaining the potential financial windfall from an ad tear service, which Netflix is expected to launch next year. And they're correctly pointing out this. Shifted from slow to no subscriber growth in the current business to advertising and page sharing coming in 2023. You can see that in the stock price. Netflix shares of about 22% in the past three months. It's really cut fire. Overall still down 63% year-to-date. But still a lot of optimism around the financial potential of this ad service. Netflix is putting this at potential almost $3 billion by 2026 and maybe 22 million subscribers. Just in this ad service loan by 2026 next year, looking at a potential 600 million ad sales from the service. Right. A tear that they moved up in terms of the launch and saying now we're pointing out to November to actually bring the launch into market. And it's really going to be a question of when the subscribers really kind of in mass start to latch on to what that new offering could give them in terms of an experience that is lower price. Perhaps you're still going to get some ads. We know that, of course. But that's been successful for launch of even the streaming landscape years back. We think back 10 years ago, even when Hulu had some of their ad-supported tears. That's really what got some of the introductory members into these streaming services back then. And so now for Netflix, knowing that they've already really capitalized on that high end of pricing mechanisms, now it's just trying to retain and not turn as many users. And so we could see potentially some of those users downgrading the pricing at least that they're willing to pay at this point. I mean, expectations game for an X-Blic has been the roller coaster. It's been so fascinating. As you mentioned, the beginning, really people not expecting anything from the company. And now as modeling for its ad platform has leaked, we've seen the expectations really go back up again. So it's hard to see where this goes if it's really going to meet or exceed those new more sanguine estimates. Yeah, it's a big tell in that didn't exist for Netflix coming into this year. That's for sure. Yeah, they're going to have to compete as well. Disney, even looking at exploring some of their own ad-supported tears within Disney Plus, that could be a major competitor for a company that's already seen a massive subscription adoption and has quickly catapulted itself into one of the most powerful streaming services. And that's even pre a massive bundle from Disney too. Yeah. Also here, we're tracking shares of craft hines. Yeah, we're going into the kitchen and into the, well, wherever you're starting to catch up and mustard that into the pantry is perhaps after Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company, upgrading it to buy from neutral with a 45.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,59,2022-10-10 18:09:53
2946," into the kitchen and into the, well, wherever you're starting to catch up and mustard's at into the pantry is perhaps after Goldman Sachs made a bullish call on the company upgrading it to buy from neutral with a $43 price target. They're saying that this is one of the consumer staples out there where higher margins profit margins. It's not fully baked in at this point. So for anybody who's looking to stock up on some catch ups or some musters perhaps graph finds is that option but there's so many other categories that that craft times has been able to really deliver for investors, especially as consumers are really monitoring where they can either buy and bulk in some cases or just get that that value that they had seen over many years and you go back to some of the household names that have the largest brand equity. We'd seen that in some of the other fashion and apparel calls out there on the street and craft times is certainly one of those right now with the largest brand equity too. Yeah we told folks. Last week when those conagren earnings numbers hit you said watch what they said on look what they said on prices they had a lot of success. Despite people becoming more mobile again pushing through price increases and that is the same theme that we are seeing in this upgrade from craft hines which is despite price increases. They're expecting all these price increases that craft took just like conagra they are likely to stick incoming quarters now that comes against a backdrop of CEO Miguel Patricio. Probably is enough credit for taking this getting this company off life support being I think he's passed his two year mark as CEO but he's out there cutting a lot of costs from this business so if you have higher prices lower costs that's a pretty good setup for profits. Yeah it seems that way investors are believing that today also. I'm taking a look at grab holdings the stock has been on the move lower down 7% right now after Barclays initiated coverage of the Asian delivery app with doubts over its long term profitability. Now it's an it's an equal weight rating here. It's a neutral waiting so it's interesting to see it taking such a hit the price target being set at $3 as you see there. And the analysis car rental costs are a substantial burden for drivers and push up fairs. The analyst does say that the company is a category leader in food delivery and ride handling in Southeast Asia with a very strong competitive position. So hence the equal weight a little bit of good little bit of bad that said grab also might be getting caught up to some extent in just the selling that we're seeing in Asian trading. But this is a company I believe it came public through us back if I'm not mistaken and the stock has not done very well since it did come public through that. Yeah you think about the ride sharing environment not just here in the US but internationally that's where grab really gets pulled into the conversation there in the markets that they operate. Where consumers right now for either the pricing that they're seeing higher or the options that are on the market in getting into micro mobility or other forms of mobility within a broader parent app if you will as uber's and lift has tried to add on some of that micro mobility element for grab it's very similar but in a market where there is much more. That's more of that micro mobility micro mobility that is actually taken advantage of by the consumers here so it's going to be how do you reach profitability while building up some of the other mobility mechanisms for consumers and knowing that you still have to make a lot of investments to retain drivers in one sense but also decrease the operating from mile costs and that's going to be a significant headwind still for all of these companies as they try to either dabble more in autonomous technology and how quickly that comes to be. And the most forward is question marks still up in the air at this point as well but for grab that is going to be something that they have to consider similarly as uber and lift do. Well I haven't bothered with this it's a $2.50 stock most people I would say watching this have never even heard a grab or taken a grab if you were that hell bent on using or investing in a ride sharing business go with uber. We just heard Brad Arickson saying uber is starting to really take market share from its largest competitor in the United States lift that might be the better way to play the space if you really want to. From one mechanism of riding and ride sharing to another one in owning a vehicle perhaps we're also watching shares of Tesla this morning after Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas cut his price target on Tesla from $383 to $350. Warning of continued headwinds into the fourth quarter and 2023 one of the notables here the fiscal year 2023 delivery forecast cut to 1.8 million versus the 2 million previously out there saying that they believe the buy side consensus range.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,60,2022-10-10 18:13:50
2947,". you Not a little bit of a downward push here to start the week with key earnings and inflation data on tap our next guest says investors should look to reach real estate investment trust. They haven't been immune to recent volatility, but our quote well prepared in this current environment National Association of Reeds economist John Worth joined us now John, you know I think of REITs as a group that are vulnerable when there's rising interest rate environment for a number of different reasons they tend to carry relatively high levels of debt, right? So their service and costs are higher. And they're seen as sort of because of their high dividend yields as almost a competing asset for something like treasuries as their yields are going higher. So talk us through why you think they're well positioned here. I'm absolutely happy to do it. You know, I think the view of REITs as being high leverage players is one that is a little bit out of date, frankly. What we've seen is that REIT leverage has been coming down for basically a decade. So today we've got leverage ratios near all time lows. The debt that REITs are holding is quite well termed out. They've got a weighted average term to maturity today of about seven years plus net interest expense as a share of their operating income is at all time lows. And about 85% of their debt is fixed rate. So they're really quite well positioned for a period of rising interest rates. And just as we compare them to other income generating alternatives, it's important to keep in mind that REITs provide income, but they're not fixed income. So they provide both income through their steady dividends as well as capital appreciation opportunities. And typically what we see is that in a period where you're coming out of a potential period of slow growth as we might be in about a year that we see REITs do quite well. So why would someone look at REITs versus say high growth internet at this point? Even though high growth internet is perhaps being redefined, REITs still have to compete for the same attention when investors are looking to get back into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a portfolio construction perspective. One of the things we see is that commercial real estate is such a fundamental piece of the overall economy. That's really critical for investors of all types. But is commercial real estate still as necessary if you have less people that are going into offices or there's more of a hybrid work approach? Is it still carrying the same weight? Absolutely. I think you really need to think about the breadth of commercial real estate. Commercial real estate, I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So for example, in REITs, you have data.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,61,2022-10-10 18:20:53
2948," I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So, for example, in REITs, you have data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. So you're getting the breadth of the economy that's housing the modern, the breadth of the real estate that's housing the modern economy. So you may feel like hybrid work is going to have people in the office less. That means you're going to have more activity through data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage names should do well, like they did in the Great Recession? Yeah, and I don't think public storage and the other self storage places are really going to benefit significantly from people maybe losing their homes. What we see is that that's a sector where we saw a huge bump during COVID, a huge bump in demand as people used the space they had differently. So they cleared out the guest room, they cleared out the garage and turned those into gyms and maybe school rooms in some cases. And that gave a huge bump to self storage demand. And then that that was got another dose of demand as the residential real estate market heated up as that market cools down. We may see some diminution in demand, but as whenever you have people making transitions in their lives, whether that that's moving, sending kids to school, bringing kids back into the household, what you see is that you they're using self storage as part of that. All right, you gave me a whole new reason to rewatch storage wars, national association of re-taconomists. John Worth, John, appreciate the time here today. Thanks. Coming up everyone, Black Friday deal season, it's kicking off. Wait a minute, it's October 10th, early at Target. All right, to say the least. We've got the details next. All right. All right. All right. All right. It is time for cut for time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this another controversy for you, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,62,2022-10-10 18:24:36
2949," It is time for Cut for Time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this. Another controversy for Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, faced social media restrictions over the weekend after users accused the rapper of posting anti-Semitic content leading to a block on both his Instagram and Twitter accounts. The reaction from this was interesting, that was reaction from Elon Musk and Elon of course, has been noted to say that he is going to do more post acquisition to try and let everybody back on the platform, raises a larger question of what Twitter will actually be if you still just have this cesspool of some of the harmful or derogatory statements that are coming back onto the platform from either Ye or even former President Donald Trump. Yeah, and I have a lot of questions about the companies that have just had to partner with Ye in various business ways. I mean, we saw what happened with Gap in the fallout from that. You see now Adidas is assessing its relationship with him. And I think, you know, when they're trying to tap into his creativity, his place in the zeitgeist, right? At the same time, they have to be cognizant of some of the potential disadvantages of partnering with somebody who can be very volatile. Good point. Black Friday is coming early for target shoppers. The retailer announced it's adding an additional three weeks to its Black Friday deals, extending the discount offerings of up to 50% off to seven weeks total. This is, I think, target just being target. Also, I should mention, we got some Adobe sales data out today predicting the holiday season sales rise to 1.5% and you're not great. This will be one of the most aggressive discounting seasons yet holiday seasons, according to Adobe. So there's lots of big deals out there, a lot of retailers, even target Walmart, sitting on a lot inventory. They have to move this stuff. They're going to start moving it early. I mean, if you go to that target website today, Black Friday is like plastered across the deals page. It's pretty interesting. Move over Lululemon's we made too much and here is we've got way too much over a target. And that's going to be the story for a lot of retailers over the course of this holiday season. How do they churn through inventory at a massively accelerated clip in order to get back into a decent position, come the start of 2023 as well? And for the consumer, how are they spending? Is it cash that they're willing to spend right now? Or is it, hey, let's just put it on the credit card. Let's figure that out later. It's going to be a lot better. Target gets half of my place right now. That place is just so addictive. You go in there and you just look to spend 20 bucks and you're down 150. You don't even know what you got. Tarje. Crazy. What? All right. And I don't anticipate it. It's side effect of Apple's new crash detection features come to light. The Wall Street Journal reporting several incidents of iPhone 14 users triggering 911 calls while riding roller coasters. So what's the deal here? It's that the iPhone automatically calls 911 with like an automated message. If it thinks you've gotten into a car crash, well, I guess being on a roller coaster feels like that you've gotten into a car crash. So they keep calling 911 and police keep showing up to various amusement parks around the country. Yeah. I mean, Swift responses that we're actually seeing triggered from the devices. So we know it works. It's just a question of, okay, how do you rein that in a little bit more? Because this is some of the technology that's featured not just in Apple's new iOS for their iPhones, but also within the watch itself. So if you have enough people that have those companion devices, you're going to see a lot of those errant, triggered calls to 911. Well, it says this out real time. Oh, shake it, Mike. No, I don't have an auto. I don't have a new iPhone. And no, no, I don't. But if you like fall down, I don't know how sensitive. Police are showing up to our house. Yeah. And how is the sensor different in this case versus when you're, say, running on a treadmill or doing some other activity? All good questions. All right. Coming up, Bikiko Fajita is going to speak with the latest analyst to the Airbnb, a rating this as we see stocks swamping on this Monday morning. Oh, and now really accelerated to the downside. The NASDAQ now off by 1.4% and the S&P off 8th 10th of 1%. Bikiko's gotcha company. He loves those nuts but coffee goes out this is easy for hard luck.

2950," Omega Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. And happy Monday to all of you. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujiweta. Here's what we're watching at this hour holding pattern and inflation data and this sort of results. We're discussing fighting the Fed with all springs George Borey. Treasury Secretary Jenna L. Warren's about the economic impact from OPEC's latest production cut. Retracking to fall out as Washington Ways a response. Frank MacCurello with the American Petroleum Institute is going to be joining us this hour with his take on the oil cartels decision. And electric vehicles going solar. The CEO of German Auto Startup Sonomoto joins us later in the show to discuss his ambitions. How the car maker plans to rev up the US EV market. First though we are as always taking a look at the market action right now. 90 minutes into the trading day. We are seeing some of those losses accelerate red across the board here. But take a look at the bottom of the screen there. The NASDAQ now hitting a two year low down about 1.3%. A lot of this coming on the back of still reaction coming from the White House and the administrations very latest efforts to crack down on semi conductors or specifically crack down on Chinese ship makers. And we have seen a lot of those declines there. Take a look at that. Named video. Intel, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, AMD, you get the picture all of them down today on the back of that extended reaction. Of course we sell the Chinese ship makers down in a big way overnight in Asia trading as well. Well there is a very busy week ahead of us for the markets. This earnings season approaches and more key economic data rolls in. And we've got our very own Yahoo finances and NAS for a to kick things off for us this hour and NAS. We're talking about earnings, economic data, certainly a lot to process in the week ahead. Yeah, that's right. A lot of data that will be watching that the markets are going to be watching. PPI that producer price index will be coming out this week. Now this is the change in price which producers receive for their services and goods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,64,2022-10-10 18:34:04
2951," be watching PPI that producer price index will be coming out this week. Now this is the change in price which producers receive for their services and goods. So that's expected to come in at 7.3 percent. The prior reading was 7.3. But the CPI, the consumer price index, that's the really big one on Thursday, which will be coming out. And that is expected to, on a year over year, expectation is that's 8.1 percent. The core CPI, that's excluding food and energy, that's expected to come in at 6.5 percent. Now the big thing here with this, with PPI, with CPI is that the numbers, although they may be well, for the core CPI, it's actually, that would be up from the previous one. But as far as the expectations, the numbers may not be coming down fast enough. And so if they're not coming down fast enough, then the Fed certainly has room to keep hiking. And also this week, you've got the FOMC minutes that are coming out. And that will be interesting because at Kiko, we will be able to also see if there's any discussion in those minutes about the size of the rate increases. If at any point, the Fed is considering to sort of put a little bit of a break on those rate increases. Yeah, and the income's at a time, obviously, where there's a debate about weather. In fact, the Fed needs to pause a bit because they've been moving so quickly. Is it going to be 50 basis points? Is it going to be 75 come November? And of course, the administration's watching it closely. One more FOMC meeting before the midterm. So a lot to digest there on that front. And as thanks so much for that. Well, US Treasury Secretary Jenner Yellen is warning about the impact OPEC's oil production cut will have on the global economy. Telling the financial times, the decision is in her words unhelpful and unwise. Of course, reinforcing the Biden administration's criticism over this move as questions arise on the repercussions that lie ahead. Let's bring in Frank McEarrula. He is API senior vice president of policy, economics, and regulatory affairs. Frank, it's good to talk to you today. We have heard several officials from the administration push back against OPEC's decision from last week. The White House saying it was short-sighted, saying that they will, in fact, respond moving forward, what is that decision meant for US oil producers? Sure. Thanks for having me on. Look, first off, it's a reminder, again, of how important it is to produce energy here in the United States and not have to rely on foreign countries like the OPEC plus nations for our energy. We have the capacity to continue to strengthen our energy security by tapping into the resources we have right here at home. And the more we do that, the less we're reliant and driven by decisions that are made somewhere else. And we did hear your president and CEO Mike Summers put out a statement on the back of that OPEC decision last week saying specifically, we urge the administration to adopt sound public policy that enables American energy to benefit Americans. What specifically does that sound policy look like? Sure. At API, we released a plan called the 10-22 that would open up federal lands and waters for oil and gas production. The Biden administration at the outset of their term closed new leasing for oil and gas development. So we would propose to open it up and continue to produce more here in the United States. The plan also calls for more energy infrastructure. The Biden administration canceled critical pipeline projects. We think the process for permitting of pipeline projects needs to be reformed so we can get energy from where it's produced to where it's needed. We also call on the plan to lift the barriers that are created by tariffs. We know that there is a supply chain issue currently in being able to produce more energy. And so we need to knock those barriers down. Finally, we think it's important to expedite LNG exports. The administration has made a commitment to Europe to export natural gas to provide relief from their reliance on Putin's net.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,65,2022-10-10 18:38:00
2952," the D.I.L.N.G. exports. The administration has made a commitment to Europe to export natural gas to provide relief from their reliance on Putin's natural gas. And so we think we need a strong policy that expedites LNG exports. And how quickly would you be able to move on that, specifically on LNG? Well, we're urging Congress and the administration to act quickly on all components of this plan. I think on LNG, it's really a question of a commitment from the government to expedite applications, a commitment from Europe to build down the necessary infrastructure to take the natural gas into its countries. But there is a commitment there on both sides. And so what we need is an acceleration of that. The oil and gas industry stands ready to help. There is another, I am, a legislation that's been floating around for some time. And this is no pack, specifically stands for no oil producing and exporting cartels act. This would essentially empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC under anti-trust rules if they are seen as setting or at least trying to attempt to control the price of oil. The Biden administration, at least in their statement, seems to suggest they want to revisit that. But I know API has specifically been very opposed to this idea. Why? This policy has been opposed on both sides of the aisle and from administrations in both parties. The real way to get OPEC is to produce more energy here in the United States. And the way to do that is to lift the pause that the administration has had on leasing. Look, at this point in the Obama administration, they had issued 60 leases for oil and gas development. This point in the Biden administration, they're just at six. And so if the administration wants to get serious about energy security and energy independence, it needs to look right here at home. And it needs to provide a pathway for more energy production here in the United States. Finally, Frank, you sort of alluded to the need for more exports coming out of the US at a time when there are concerns about supply globally. You have put out a letter here saying that any kind of export ban we're talking about diesel, but also refined products would deplete inventory levels and it would put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices. Of course, the administration argument would be, we'll at a time when there was concerns about supply crunch, that supply should be left domestically. So walk me through your calculation. Why does this deplete supply in your opinion? And why would that push prices higher? Sure, it's not our opinion in July of this year, the American Council for Capital Formation studied this issue. They found that an export ban on refined product would end up cutting refinery capacity by 1.3 million barrels per day here in the United States. It would end up raising costs for fuel for consumers across the United States. It would cost jobs, about 85,000 jobs would be lost under such a policy. And finally, it would harm American GDP. And so for all of those reasons and for American energy security, the refined export product ban is a bad idea. Finally, this administration has made a commitment to our allies overseas, to other countries that we support, to Latin America, where we export an enormous amount of refined product. It's made a commitment to those allies that we're gonna continue to provide the energy that we have right here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly, imposing such a policy would certainly not help the American consumer. And where are those conversations stand right now with the administration? I know there's been a bit of a back and forth. Oftentimes it has been reported as being a little more contentious. In terms of specifically an export ban, what's your understanding of where the administration stands? Well, we've made the case. We've laid out the data that shows that such a policy would have negative implications for the American people for the driving public. I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,66,2022-10-10 18:42:21
2953," I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United States has world-class leading refineries and they produce the fuels that the world needs. And so we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or LNG. Frankly, looks toward American energy production as the solution. And we've set all along the solution to the challenges that we face, actually lie under our feet. Because of innovation and technology, we've increased production here in the United States from seven million barrels to 12 million barrels per day. We can do more, but we need the policies in place to help us achieve that. Frank MacIarola, API Senior Vice President of Policy Economics and Regulatory Affairs, I appreciate your time today. Sure, thank you. Well, time now for our trending ticker. We are seeing shares of Rivian in reverse. Getting punished after the company were called nearly all of its electric vehicles. You see that's stocked down more than 10%. The announcement affects more than 12,000 vehicles, including the Rivian R1T pickup, as well as the R1S SUV and some delivery vans that have been produced for Amazon. The carmaker says no injuries have been reported so far, but there are concerns about a fastener that wasn't tightened properly that could affect driver's ability to steer the vehicle. Rivian says the fixes will be implemented over the next 30 days. And stay tuned later in the show because we will be speaking with Sonno Motors, co-founder and CEO Lauren Hahn, live from the NASDAQ Market site, the group kicks off its nationwide solar mobility tour to debut at the Affordable Solar EV for the first time in the U.S. That is coming up a little later in just an hour.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,67,2022-10-10 18:47:04
2954," We are on the cusp of yet another earning season and markets are turning to JP Morgan, the city, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley as they report during the most uncertain of economic environments for preview of what to expect. Let's bring in Yahoo finances, Alexandra Seminova. These are always, it's always a good bell leather, right? About where things are in terms of the economy, as we said, never been more uncertain. Yeah, absolutely, Akiko. Those four bangs among the six largest in the U.S. by assets are set to be the opening act of the earnings season with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America set to release results next week and some of the themes that we'll be watching closely are a slowdown in investment banking revenues, potential alias across their businesses, how demand for loans is holding up with higher interest rates, and any potential warnings about the economy that CEOs may deliver on earnings calls. And this quarter profits are expected to shrink, especially compared to a really robust 2021 for Wall Street. Profits are also likely to take a hit from higher loan loss provisions. Those are funds that aside by banks for any potential sour loans if customers don't make their payments. The six largest U.S. banks are estimated to set aside a collective $4.5 billion this quarter that's according to a financial time's report today. And this is also a turnaround from a year ago when banks actually benefited from releasing those reserves as we were recovering from the pandemic. One notable thing to note too is that banks typically benefit from higher interest rate environments. Those often give them a nice boost on their net interest income, but investment banking revenue is likely to offset that and some other things to look out for too are any comments that bank executives make. Jamie Diamond is always an interesting one on his earnings calls with his storm cloud warnings, credit suites and the broad, what that means for the broader industry, and also a bank of American Morgan Stanley are estimated to lose a combined $500 million on Elon Musk's Twitter deal. You know worth noting the bar pretty low going into earnings season, not just within banks, but overall. Thanks so much for that. I know you're going to be tracking those results really closely. Moving on here as we look ahead to there you go. There's the prompt. It looks like a wider look on market, CD Ameritrade, out with its investor movement index showing traders took a more risk off approach in September for more about what these results mean and what's driving the trends. Let's bring in Sean Cruz, TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Sean, these notes are always really interesting to me, a very good gauge of where the retail investor stands feels like it's pretty much tracking with the rest of the market. Things just aren't feeling very good. Yeah, I think right now we got a little bit of a head fake back in August. There was actually recovery for the first time this year. We actually had that investor movement index tick higher. And I think that quickly got wiped off the table in September. So what we did see in what clients were buying, they were certainly being a little bit more conservative and that they weren't going out there buying some of the more speculative areas of the market, some of the more speculative names that maybe aren't profitable right now or just have some very high multiples. They're not really reaching for those right now. They're going back to some of the more familiar established names out there. In some cases really looking at names with quality fundamentals, be that solid revenues, solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets, leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact some of those more highly levered companies versus the more fundamentally sound companies. So they still found some opportunities out there, but they certainly are a little bit cautious right now. And I think that makes sense. And we're going to get to some of those names we just showed on the screen there, but probably speaking, what has led to the sell-off that you have seen exiting of positions? Is it really just about the Fed? I think that really was what drove that optimism in August and that light at the end of the tunnel from the Fed, Pausian or potentially even reverse and some of those rate hikes gave it drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light the end of the tunnel ended up being a train coming your way instead. And that really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,68,2022-10-10 18:51:04
2955," or potentially even reversing some of those rate hikes gave it. Drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light the end of tunnel end up being a train coming your way instead. And that really drove that shift in sentiment in that not only were we getting some data that did indicate they haven't made significant progress, they are starting to have an effect, look at housing, for instance. But the Fed kept coming out. Whenever the market would give a little bit of a pop of optimism, you would almost have a Fed speaker, someone somewhere come out and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion. And that's why we're trading down at these levels. I think the market's going to respond differently to maybe a hawkish Fed when we're trading at 3,600 on the S&P 500 versus say trading up at 4,000 or 4,200. So I do think a lot of that is now priced in. If things get significantly worse and that's why we just spoke about the bank earnings, that is going to be huge. The macro read through on what we hear from the banks, I think is really going to set the tone for the rest of earnings seasons. And I think the market is also going to change their macro outlook based on what we hear. So let's talk about some of those names that we have seen big moves in. In terms of net buyers, we're seeing a lot of the chip makers. You could argue that's part of evaluation play given just how far some of these names have pulled back, but in terms of those that are being sold. Exxon, mobile and BP, an interesting one to me because energy has been pretty strong is this sort of the expectation that we have reached the peak with some of these names and the pullback is coming? That is where we see that type of activity. I don't think anyone expects crude oil to completely fall apart anytime soon. But I do think they're looking at it from a little bit more of a valuation standpoint. And we've seen that where you get these energy companies trading towards the bottom of their range. That's where there's a lot of interest in buying. When they recover and they start hitting towards the upper end of those ranges, that's where they rotate out of those. So I think it's an interesting strategy. It's more of a short term strategy. I think we see playing out, but they use those profits when they do decide to roll out and lower exposure in those names. We actually do see them going out there and trying to find opportunity elsewhere. And I, some of the conductors last month, was that that key spot. I think we saw a lot of interest on the buy side. Certainly today, I think caught a lot of people off guard. If you look at the semiconductors that are really getting hit, it's the semiconductor companies that really have a lot of exposure to that relationship with China and just what goes on the onshore offshore aspect of their supply chains. But I think what they were looking at, if you look at the charts, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, all those names were hitting the support levels. And when you see these support levels, these ranges, they start to approach the lower end. That's where you get a lot of buy and activity. I'm going to venture, guess we look at this again next month. We're going to see a lot of selling as they broke through some of those. I was going to say, I wonder if some of that buying holds, especially as we get these warnings about demand, especially from a lot of these big chip makers, TSMC and other one, we're expected to hear from this week. Sean Cruz, a TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Thanks so much for joining us today.

Joining us now is Richard Clark, managing director at A.B. Bernstein. Richard, there's a number of things that you highlight here, but really the point being that this isn't just about Airbnb being able to protect its market share and the vacation rental business, you think they could really make a significant play on hotels and experiences as well. Walk me through that thesis. Yeah, I mean, I think that's absolutely right. So I think the vacation rental market is still very exciting. I think it's a big market. It's going to gain share of the overall lodging market. And Airbnb will think we'll gain share within that. But probably beyond that, even more exciting, is that ability to sell more than just vacation rental market. It doesn't market as much as other travel platforms. So it has a loyal customer following. Has a very strong brand. Do we think they can sell longer stays, hotel rooms, experiences, and they can add to its growth? The longer stays have been a real growth spot for Airbnb, something they've been highlighting especially over the course of the pandemic. The hotels specifically, where do you see them making a play when you look at how fragmented the market is right now? Yeah, so I mean, I think actually the hotel market is fragmented. The distribution market is not that fragmented. You've got booking and expedia. They're quite dominant in their respective geographies. So I think the actual hotels are looking for other distribution channels to broaden their landscape a little bit. And I think Airbnb is unique in the sense that it does try and inspire the customer. It's got this category-based search. It tries to find a way to match the customer and the product up in the way that we don't see in other companies. I think that gives it a way to make a play in hotels. So you see the platform revolving into a place where hotels can also list their openings? Well, they're already on. I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on Airbnb, or hotels in it. They signed a deal with Sightminder. They signed a deal with OU. And that gave them somewhere around 70 to 80,000 hotels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,70,2022-10-10 19:00:55
2957," you you you you triple refesions And as we see how that translates in terms of volatility, we see that the VIX above 30 here, signaling that some of the signs of a possible recession, certainly not helped today by JP Morgan Chase, CEO, Jamie Diamond, warning of a likely recession in the next six to nine months. Taking a look at what we're seeing in the sector action. We're seeing travel stocks under pressure, and that's as China reimposed COVID-19 lockdown with new daily cases tripling over the week long holiday and right before a key government meeting in Beijing next week. You can see some of the ones most under pressure. There you have trip.com. That's up. That's down about almost 6% there. And same with when they're down almost 12%. Also want to take a look at what we're seeing with the broader sector action here. As we can see, some of these mega caps under pressure, but as you break it down by sector here, we're seeing that in terms of the big winners of the day that are at least pulling ahead for now, we're seeing consumer staples in the green. Those are up about half a percent. Energy though, they're down about 2%. Sure, no? Michelle, let's take a look at the tech sector. You were just mentioning some of the underperformers there, specifically what we're seeing in energy. XlK, the technology sector not too far behind on an interday basis off just around one and a half percent. You're today clearly under pressure. As we've seen selling across almost every aspect of this industry here, you're today XlK off just around 31%. The S&P tech sector lagging the broader index by the most since 2002, that is on a year-to-date basis. Take a look at some of the individual movers within the XlK why we're seeing such losses today. A lot of that has to do with the selling that we're actually seeing in the chip stocks and take a look at the screen. You're really seeing a broad base selling here in video, Qualcomm, AMD among the worst performers in this group, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, all hitting 52 week low. So the selling that we saw all started at the end of last week continuing into today. I guess you can say that the selling has been happening since the start of the year. But we got that warning from AMD last week in terms of the third quarter revenue guidance that way on the broader chip index, the new restrict.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,71,2022-10-10 19:03:55
2958," that the selling has been since the start of the year. But we got that warning from AMD last week in terms of the third quarter revenue guidance that way on the broader chip index, the new restrictions imposed from the Biden administration in terms of exports to China. That's a headwind here for this group heading into the fourth quarter and then into 2023. So big reason why we are seeing that selling and then I also want to pull up the Philly Semiconductor Index. You look at some of the movements that we're seeing today the Philly Semiconductor Index on the last quarter of the year. So we're seeing that just around 3% year to date off more than 40% you see that drop of just around 42% the lowest level today that we've seen since November 2020 also on track for that two day drop. If we take a look at the two day chart here off just around 9% that would be the largest two day drop date that we have seen since March of 2020. Wow. Shana. Thank you. Let's get up to speed now on the situation in the past. Last week, we were launching 84 cruise missiles on Monday along with drone attacks as well. At least 11 people were killed and powered knocked out in several regions of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin says the attacks were in retaliation for that apparent Ukrainian attack on a key supply bridge over the weekend. Ukraine is not claimed credit. President Biden condemned the quote utterly brutality of Putin's illegal war and also says that the country will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression. Not entirely clear of course what those costs will be. Michelle. Indeed, we're certainly a lot there for markets to digest. Let's take a look at that market reaction and we turn to Liz Young. So vice head of investment strategy. Liz, obviously the markets have a lot of information to digest and they're wondering how the Fed is going to interact to these different data points and what the Fed is going to do. Investor sentiment is pretty extended on the bearish side and it seems difficult to find really a lot of positivity in that and you can look at that a couple different ways. You can look at it as there isn't much to grasp on to as far as looking forward and getting positive about a soft landing or you can say that when things get this extreme on the bearish side we're getting closer and closer to that being over. Now what we're still looking at is that the Fed is going to be a lot more than just a few years. So what you've clearly pointed out is that there are a ton of data points rolling in many of which are telling us that the economy is softening things are slowing but it still hasn't been enough to fight that big enemy which is inflation. So it keeps the Fed on this path. The jobs numbers from last week keep the Fed on this path and that's what the market is really grappling with. What do you think has been accounted for? So if you look at just the movement in what the market expects the terminal rate to be so the rate at which the Fed will stop hiking and either pause or have to eventually cut that rate has actually moved up or that expectation has moved up just even in the last week we're looking at about 4.7% terminal rate as expected by the market by March of next year. So you could assume that that's sort of what's priced in but you're still looking at the expectation of a recession still only about 50 50 and with a market that's been down at most 25% peak to trough this year it would tell me that we still have further to go on the downside to really price in a recession and that could be what we see through October as we start to get earnings information if companies start to revise down and as economic data continues to soften we could get closer and closer to that 30% 35% down which would effectively price in the recession in my opinion. Speaking of Richell mentioned off the top the prediction from Jamie Diamond 6 to 9 months before we're tip into a recession that Europe is already there and that our markets could have another 20% to follow your thoughts on the latest comments from Jamie. So look it's not necessarily new that he's said that he's worried about economic growth so it's not the first time that he's mentioned this but it's definitely possible and you know even 6 to 9 months seems a little far out to me I think that if we do see a recession or the beginning of one that it'll happen in the first half of 2023 as far as another 20% down in the market that feels like a lot to me and look where a Caulie savings of $10330 based bring on от the balls noticed",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,72,2022-10-10 19:09:09
2959," or the beginning of one that it'll happen in the first half of 2023. As far as another 20% down in the market, that feels like a lot to me and look, nobody really knows how much further it could go and where the stopping point is, but 20% more does feel like a lot to me. And if you just think about on average to price in a recession or a drawdown during a recession, you do have to get beyond 30%. And we haven't quite gotten there yet. So at this point, the market is still sort of hoping that we can avert one. I don't know that we need to go down another 20%. I feel like 3,300 on the S&P is a pretty good stopping point, if not beyond where we might stop. But again, who knows what the future holds. There's a lot of different things that could happen. And one of the things that I think investors should really be watching is credit spreads. There hasn't been a huge blowout in spreads. They've widened, but in a really orderly fashion so far, if credit spreads start to become more troublesome and get to a level where we're worried about defaults, particularly in the corporate market or in consumer lending, that's when you have to start assuming that the stock market will go down much further. So then Liz, given those factors, then, a lot of investors, especially retail investors, one ring, should I hold onto my cash, is that the safer bet versus say other opportunities? What are you seeing in terms of opportunities? Say, what's the play here? Short term versus longer term. So in the short term look, it's not a bad idea to hold onto your cash if you're nervous, but here's what I would say. We've already done a lot of work on the valuation side. So we've done a lot of re-rating in stocks. Like I said before, we've gone down at one point from peak to trough 25% in the S&P. So if things continue to fall, it's okay to start thinking about buying that incrementally on the way down. And you can look at, many people are talking about a barbell approach. I do think that that's a good approach. So on one end of the barbell, you've got safety stocks, which are pretty expensive right now, and I would keep that in mind. You can also think about putting things in there like gold. You can think about using treasuries at this level. And then on the other end of the barbell, look at some of those growthier names or some of those cyclical sectors that are probably trading at pretty attractive valuations compared to where they were a year and a half, two years ago. So thinking about just entering into those names systematically, don't spend it all at once, but systematically as we go down and always remember the market bottoms before the economy bottoms. So by the time the market is done with its down draft, the economy still has to follow. And by the time the economy bottoms, the market usually has started to recover. Well, Liz, what you're saying right now about those growthier, more cyclical names, brings me to tech and the selling that we're seeing today. Really what we've seen since the start of the year, clearly we have seen a large drop in valuations is selling that we're seeing today. They'll bring the Nasdaq to its lowest level that we've seen in more than two years. I guess what do you think it's going to take to get investors back on board or if they are picking some of those growthier names, those cyclical plays, what should more specifically should they be looking for? So one of the things that you covered earlier in the show was semiconductors. And what I would say to people about that, it's important to think about this. The way that the economy has changed and the things that the U.S. economy is now dependent on are much more technology focused. So semiconductors have really taken over as one of those cyclical indicators in the tech space. So on a day where we're having increased recession fear and we're still worried about the fed raising rates too far and putting us into a recession, it is probably not any surprise that semiconductors are under a lot of pressure because they are that cyclical indicator for tech. Now as they continue to get hurt and as we see recession fears heat up, as the market prices that in, that's when those names start to become attractive. So I would still be waiting a little bit and maybe even beyond when the S&P gets lower than 3,500 if that's the case, but that's when you start to nibble on some of those names. But you want to be choosy about it and make sure that you've diversified your portfolio still outside of tech because rates are going to stay high for quite a period of time here until inflation is under control, which means that technology, communications and even some consumer discretionary names could have a lid on their upside because of that rate hike. But you can start to enter back into what I would call the sort of cream of the crop in each of those groups. Um, right?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,73,2022-10-10 19:13:05
2960," because of that rate hike, but you can start to enter back into what I would call the sort of cream of the crop in each of those groups. All right, we'll certainly some great options there. Big thank you to Liz Young from SOFY. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Well, one of the major railroad unions has rejected the proposed deal with freight railroads renewing the possibility of a strike. About 56% of the members of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division rejected the deal, which includes 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses. The union president saying the railroaders do not feel valued. For now, the union has agreed to delay any strike until five days after Congress reconvenes in mid-November to allow time for additional negotiations. All right, we'll say with us, we're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Life. Coming up, automakers are getting hit hard on Wall Street following a major recall from the Rivian and a pessimistic analyst take on GM and Ford will have those details. And Kanye West's Twitter account was locked after he tweeted anti-Semitic comments. It begs the question, would that be the case if Elon Musk owns Twitter? We'll ask a long time tech investor about that. And Hulu may have just gotten a little more expensive for subscribers. We'll give you those numbers. Don't go anywhere. Rivian shares a sinking today. You can see the stock off just around 7% after voluntarily, recalling more than 12,000 vehicles over concerns of a possible steering and suspension hazard. Yahoo Finance, a senior auto reporter, Prestige Vermine, is here with more on this press. Looking at the stock reaction, Wall Street obviously very concerned about this recall. What's your take on it? It's just not a good look right now when they had this critical Q4 coming up. They got to meet these deliveries and hit that goal of 25,000 cars a year. It's a simple issue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,74,2022-10-10 19:17:06
2961," What's your take on it? It's just not a good look right now when they have this critical Q4 coming up. They've got to meet these deliveries and hit that goal of 25,000 cars a year. You know, it's a simple issue. It's a tiny bolt on an arm in front of the steering knuckle. But if it fails, it's a catastrophic steering failure. Right? So they have to do this. Safety is an utmost concern. It's good they're doing this now. But it's just sort of, you know, as one analyst, it's a black eye for them. Right? As like there's credibility issues already on the table for them. And now you have this on top of their big goal in Q4. So I think it's kind of like, you know, you see the analyst, the chart. It's just a concern there right now for them to perform. It reads like a bit of an overreaction based on the fact there are no deaths, no real serious accidents, a very small incident number as well. This is a proactive company really getting ahead of it. I want to ask you about Tesla as well, some massive numbers out of China breaking a record. And the flip side, huge numbers out of China, the Giga Shanghai 83,000 vehicles, delivered to biggest month ever. This after they sort of did these upgrades that Shanghai fac of facility over the summer, they shut down for a bit and now they're really pumping out cars there. Tesla and the latest quarter said that they can produce around 750,000 vehicles per year there now. That's like, that's the biggest factory. So huge install based right now in Giga Shanghai. Now we just got to couch that. There are new lockdowns already underway in China, not where the Tesla factory is yet, but their caseload tripled after the weekend. So new lockdowns in China could eventually impact Tesla as well. Rochelle. And, Pros, stick around because I want to turn out a Ford and GM. We saw a UBS analyst Patrick Hummel downgrading both stocks, citing an expected we can demand thanks to inflationary pressures, as well as some of these supply constraints we continue to hear about. Now, Hummel predicts, quote, that it will take three to six months for the auto industry to end up in oversupply. So, Pros, what's your reaction to this? Does it seem like one step forward, two steps back for some of these auto makers right now? It's, you know, it's a little surprising even the last two and a half years we've seen the supply be the problem for the auto makers. They were able to command huge margins, extreme pricing power because of the fact they didn't have enough supply. And now we're talking about demand actually turning down and the supply becoming a problem when you have more cars than that actually needed for the market, probably by I think the analyst saying next year. So, I'm not assuming they thought that Ford was actually in a worse place in GM because of their product portfolio and stuff like supply chain. So, I'm curious what you guys think about that. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I just think it's just in terms of the demand destruction, projection part of it, the fact that it's falling apart and falling apart so quickly, I think that caught me a little bit off guard. Yes, we talked about the fact that the economy is weakening. People are going to be pulling back on spending, but I didn't necessarily, I guess, expected to be to that degree so quickly. So, that's something that jumped out to me. And then also just in terms of what he does like, you be saying that they favor automakers with a luxury exposure, one of them being Mercedes just given the fact that more the higher end to consumers could potentially be more resilient if we do say a large economic downturn. Yeah, I just, it is shocking the U-turn. Yeah. It was just a couple of weeks ago that Ford told us 40, 45,000 cars did not have the parts and they'd have to park them until, and now we're talking about again, oversupply in the next three to six months, it is hard to imagine as going into a world where that is a situation. Dealers across the country, as you know, pros, are wiped out. They are still empty. So dramatic turnaround like that, I can't quite imagine. But apparently they're seeing it. We've seen it only in the used car sector. Car max got hit hard at earnings. The new car segment we haven't seen, demand destruction yet. Because there hasn't been supply. But really interesting point about the luxury demand side, because we write a lot about that. How it's insatiable demand, Rolls Royce, Bentley, Mercedes, those types of names. They can't find enough buyers, I mean, they can't find enough cars for their buyers. And on the, on the flip side, Ford and GM potentially, this analyst thinks that there's a problem for them because there's, these buyers are less able to weather the storm. I like potential downturn. But I guess the measure is interesting because of coming out at a time when we're still talking about the supply chain issues that a lot of these larger automakers make. Yes. So how is that going to be corrected so quickly that then would leave to this oversupply when we haven't been able to get our, get a better grasp of this now for over two years? I really can't see this being a prompt for this back half of next year. If you really think about it, I think that's what the analyst is kind of saying. But he's kind of putting his mark on the table right now. Ford, it said Ford.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,75,2022-10-10 19:21:43
2962," can't see this being a problem with the back half of next year if you really think about it. I think that's what the analyst is kind of saying but he's kind of putting his mark on the table right now like Ford. He said Ford we see absolute downside for Ford. That's a direct quote. I mean that's crazy. Right now they have very very strong pricing power. I don't know maybe EBS will have the last laugh on this one. It certainly looks like Wall Street is worried about the downgrade here with Ford chairs. Sink you to air. Press. Thanks so much for that. Coming up Amazon's two-day prime early access sale. Kicking off tomorrow, rivals though are ready for a fight for your dollar and are lining up with deals of their own. Stay tuned for more on that next. Retailers are starting up their holiday sales events even earlier this year. And Amazon is leading the charge with its second prime day of the year. You know the finances Ali Garfinkle joins us now with what we can expect from this sales event which starts tomorrow. So Ali what are you watching? So Rochelle there are a couple of things. The first is that this is the second prime day of the year right. This is their first time doing two prime days and that first prime day this summer Rochelle was so successful. They touted it as their greatest prime day ever point blank. So we'll see if they can replicate that magic in a really difficult economic environment where they",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,76,2022-10-10 19:25:35
2963," started it as their greatest prime day ever, point blank. So we'll see if they can replicate that magic in a really difficult economic environment where they have more competition, right? Amazon's leading the charge, but we've seen Target, Walmart, Best Buy, you name it, everyone's got a sale going on this month. So to that end, look for some really deep discounts. Amid the inflation squeeze, companies are doing whatever it takes to get you to buy something. And for Amazon, what that means is, yes, the Amazon, the viral Amazon code from a couple years ago has returned, but it also means connected devices are going to be the star. They just had their devices and services event. And if there's one thing you're going to see, is you're going to see the Echo, Ring, Fire TV. Those are all going to be deeply, deeply discounted. If there's one thing I've learned covering Amazon, Rochelle, those devices are key to their future. They see it as key to their future and they haven't been immune to this tech route. So it makes sense that they will be pushing these connected devices at one of their most important events of the year. That certainly makes sense, getting everyone deeper into the ecosystem indeed. Thank you as always, Ali Gawfinkel. Dave. Thank you, Adobe Analytics forecast online sales in November and December, Tariah is just 2.5%. That's the slowest rates since 2015. And also it compares to 8.6%. Just a year ago, where we headed, Christine Short is the VP of Research for Wall Street, Horizon, Christine, nice to see you. So I guess tomorrow is kind of like Black Friday on a Tuesday in early October. It's a little confusing. How much does this change everything these October sales in terms of traditional holiday sales? Well, we've been seeing this for a few years, right? Like the Black Friday, the holiday sales keep getting moved early and earlier. And that's because consumers are demanding it. They want to spread out their shopping over a longer period of time. It used to be a day after Thanksgiving through Cyber Mondays. You know, you've got about five days of deals. Now you've got a couple of months of deals. So I think we're responding to consumer demand. I think it's also really smart for a lot of these retailers, Ali mentioned it's not just Amazon, but it's Target, Walmart. You've got some of the department stores, Maysees, Coles, Bed Bath and Beyond. They're all doing this because what research and which surveys have shown is that consumers are getting a little more anxious about inflation. They feel okay about their job position. Unemployment is still very historically low, but as the year goes on, something consumers are looking at. So why not get your holiday shopping out of the way now? What does it mean for shopping later? I think it just spreads out a little more. You might actually have a chance to get more money out of consumers, but I think by front loading it, it's a very smart thing. And I think those that are, there's always got your late shoppers. There will still be people shopping throughout the rest of the year, but I think it's smart to start it earlier this year. Yeah, you're talking about me and Shana Smith. I'm usually December 23rd-ish. I'm still waking up in a pumpkin spice latte, which was like two months ago. Axios has a story today saying the traditional holiday shopping season is dead. Is that true? I don't know about that. Some people really like to do it just as an activity with their family to go in person the day after Thanksgiving. But yeah, it's certainly taking a big hit here, right? And like I said, this has been a trend that's been ongoing the last few years, but as far as the shopping online is still continuing to pick up in popularity, it doesn't mean people aren't gonna be spending, right? National Retail Federation with their holiday forecast and survey show that yeah, two-thirds of people are still gonna spend on gifts, on celebrations this year. They feel like they haven't been able to do as much the last couple of years because of COVID restrictions. So whether it means taking out of savings or redirecting money that would otherwise go somewhere else or even going into credit card debt, they will be spending money this holiday season now that we're kind of getting back to normal. The story of this retail year has been an inventory issue too much of it. Is that still the case? And is there anyone that got it right? Yeah, you know, we went into this saying, the bigger sophisticated retailers like your target, like your Walmart, they set up for last holiday season, we thought they were gonna get it right, they weren't new to this. Clearly they didn't, there was loads.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,77,2022-10-10 19:30:19
2964," like your target, like your Wal-Mart, they set up for last holiday season. We thought they were gonna get it right. They weren't new to this. Clearly they didn't. There was loads of inventory on the shelves for many of those big retailers. I think we've had over a year now to get it right. So I think retailers setting into this holiday season are certainly in a better position. So that's not as much of a concern this year. And so I think that that's one thing we don't necessarily have to worry about. Costs are still very high, right? So we're talking a little about Amazon here. Despite the fact that this is probably gonna be a great prime event. The costs over the last few quarters have been eating into those revenues. So that's something we're gonna look out for as well. Is this a positive story, though? Will it be for the holiday season? This bulk and inventory should result in discount. Should be a deflationary and even a positive fed story, although not a great earning story. Yeah, like Ali said, it's anything to push the inventory and to give deep discounts. So it is a complex situation where you've got higher costs. Inflation is creating higher costs for everything, right? But the consumer really wants value right now. So you have to be offering discounts. And some of the ones that we've seen already as advertised from target from Amazon. We're talking 50 to 80% off of some of the most popular items. So they're actually willing to take a hit in some ways just to get to the consumer who really is looking for the deepest discounts possible right now. So promotions are going to be huge and pushing out some of that extra inventory. It's not a great investor story, but it is a good consumer story. I want to come full circle back to the story we started with where online sales rising just 2.5%. But the brick and mortar stories, the real fascinating one, more stores opened in 21 than closed for the first time since 1995, according to Morgan Stanley, what is the deal with brick and mortar making a comeback? You know, I think people miss that. They miss the brick and mortar. We've seen, like you said, e-commerce sales have come down since the peak of COVID where they were really at their highest. So I think you're going to see more of a blend this year, whereas the story that lasts like 10 years for holiday shopping has been that e-commerce. It's continuing to pick up. But I think again, it's more of an activity. It's something to do together with friends with family. And so people like going out there. They like looking at the items they're buying. And honestly, retailers like that too, because there's less things getting returned. And that's what we're seeing a third of things bought online and up getting returned because you really haven't had a chance to see and experience it. So if they can get you to buy and brick and mortar, retailers are going to be pretty happy about that. Reports of brick and mortar's death greatly exaggerated. Wall Street Horizon, VP of Research, Christine Short. Good to see you. Thanks. All right, coming up. It's been a roller coaster of a day for big tech. But it's been smooth sailing for Netflix.

2965," I'm women women women women women wearing a dress before the insurance school bus tracks onusal reimagining earlier. All right, it's time for triple play with three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got five, nine, craft and Netflix on deck. Now my pick is Cloud Software Provider 5.9 to get FIVN. You see the stock down more than 24 percent there. Now the share started falling after CEO Rowan Trollup announced his resignation. Now he'll be leaving at the end of November and in a tweet, Trollup said, quote, he'd accepted a position as CEO of Avenger Backed pre-IPO startup I remain very bullish about the opportunity at 5.9. Investors though digesting this change against the backdrop of better than expected preliminary third quarter financial results. Up chairman and former 5.9 CEO Mike Berkland is coming back to the role. That's after resigning in 2017 due to a cancer diagnosis. The stock did hit a 52 week low on this leadership change announcement. But Berkland said he's excited about the path forward. Saying, quote, we are still in the early innings of the shift to cloud driven by key trends such as digital transformation and the strategic importance of customer experience. Now most analysts do still have a buy rating on the stock. So there's still some bullishness here, but at least just for today on the leadership change, the stock under a lot of pressure. Show them. If I shall, nearly 25 percent, you mentioned hitting a 52 week low today, even though many analysts are still bullish, actually Morgan Stanley downgrading the stock today to equal weight from overweight. So they have some questions just about what the stock and what the returns are going to look like at least in the short term. It wasn't all bad news. I'm a little surprised to see the stock off as substantially as it is today, given those pre-limb numbers that you just went through, the fact that revenue actually coming in, they expect better than expected. $198 million adjusted EPS guidance to $0.38 or initial forecast was $31.33. But it looks like analysts have a lot of questions just about the new leadership at what $59 is going to look like looking out to 2023. All right, my play today is craft gaining a today after gold. And you can see it up just about 3 percent. When upgraded this stock to buy from neutral, lifted its price target to $43 to share from $37.26 percent upside from where it's currently trading. Now, Goldman, making the case that craft offers the highest free cash flow and dividend yields of their coverage within this space and that higher profit margins haven't fully been priced into this stock. Now, in a note to clients, the team wrote that the pace of share recovery is, quote, meaningfully slower than what they had initially anticipated in its market share. So well below those pre pandemic levels, year to date, date that coming has actually done relatively well when you take a look at the broader market. Your today, it's only off just around nearly 5 percent compared to the losses that we're seeing more broadly within this space and also with the broader market. So it looks like they think craft at least has an edge, a competitive edge in this space for now. Kind of a yeah, but note, right? I mean, I very rarely read an upgrade with the words relative valuation levels for staples are daunting. Now we've been richer than the onset of the last recession. Yeah, but they have that competitive advantage over their competitors. So though whether that storm, UBS upgraded them on Thursday as well. So they're not alone at Goldman. My play is Netflix shares up on a day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,79,2022-10-10 19:39:12
2966," They have that competitive advantage over their competitors. So though, whether that's storm, UBS upgraded them on Thursday as well. So they're not alone at Goldman. My play is Netflix shares up on a down day overall due to a no down from JP Morgan analyst Doug and Mew. He says the streaming giants upcoming and support ad supported tears, critical to re-accelerating revenue, expanding Netflix's serviceable available market and driving greater profitability. And with estimates, there will be 7.5 million ad supported subs in the U.S. and Canada. That generates 1.2 billion in 23 and 4.6 billion in additional revenue by 26, a 13% upside that JP Morgan analyst all has a neutral rating on the stock, a $240 price target. Netflix though has lost subs and back-to-back quarters for the first time ever. They'll report earnings one week from tomorrow. It shares down those 60 plus percent this year up on this news over 2%. A lot of people have a lot of high hopes for that ad supported tear. It is going to be all or nothing once that is implemented, Rochelle. No, it's very true. Netflix is really trying to reassure investors. We saw that ad age reporting the Netflix is tapping integral ad science and double verify to really help with these measurements when it comes to ads as well, trying to reassure investors because as you imagine, this is going to be real game change. After the subscriber number started to go down and all the other streamers jumped in as well, Netflix looking for this edge, looking for way to get perhaps billions in with some of these ad supported tears. So we'll have to see how it pans out and how much people are going to be willing to pay for each tear as well. A number of analysts bullish here, Elinick, Equity's, Oppenheimer, Evercore, all upgrading the stock over the last several weeks. So we'll see how it all pans out with our new ad supported tear. All right, coming up, early Facebook investor Roger McNeigh joins us to discuss Elon Musk, Twitter, the metaverse, and much more. I highly recommend the producers to seeinda. Kanye West getting suspended on social media over the weekend, both Twitter and Instagram moving to restrict his accounts following a string of anti-symmatic posts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,80,2022-10-10 19:43:21
2967," Kanya West getting suspended on social media over the weekend, both Twitter and Instagram moving to restrict his accounts following a string of anti-Semitic posts. Kanya was first locked out of Instagram, which prompted him to take to Twitter for the first time in two years. It's the latest test for social media companies' willingness to monitor hateful content on their sites. Joining us now for more on this we want to bring in Roger McNamy, elevation partners managing director and author of Zuck. Roger, it's great to see you again. Certainly there has been a large debate about content moderation. How social media companies should go about this. It's just from your perspective, what is this hellish in terms of where we are when it comes to policies and the handling of hate speech on these social media platforms? The context is that six years ago there was interference in the UK referendum around Brexit and then the US presidential election. Since then we've had ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. We've had extraordinary number of terrorist events. We've had the COVID pandemic and the undermining of the country's response to that. We've had the insurrection with stopped the steal. We've had extraordinary damage done to democracy, the public health, the public safety, the people's ability to make their own choices. And yet policy makers have done nothing. Absolutely nothing. And I think that the whole situation with Kanye West, with Elon Musk attempting to buy Twitter really highlights the extraordinary inaction. And frankly in my mind, really unpardonable inaction by Congress, by the President, to do something about what is clearly a threat, not just to safety in the country, but especially in national security. Twitter has a whistleblower who showed that there are people inside Twitter who are working for foreign governments. And for a platform that has as much influence on politics and democracy as Twitter has, that's extraordinarily dangerous. And so Roger, where does the conversation go in terms of accountability for those posting as well as those moderating and the pace at which they're able to monitor these things? So I'm not at all confident that we can fix this problem. There are three aspects of it. The first is the scale of the platforms. Facebook for example, where the worst offenses have taken place has literally billions of posts every day. So the notion that you're going to somehow effectively monitor that number of posts is a big stretch. The second problem is latency, the amount of time, even if you had enough moderators, even if the artificial intelligence worked, which it doesn't. But even if those things work perfectly, there's still going to be a lag. And the problem is the harm gets done in the first seconds after these harmful posts are put out. The third problem is one of incentives. And this is the one that's killing us because there is no reason from an economic perspective why these companies should look out for the safety of their users, much less protecting the country's national interest. Right now, the incentives are for them to make as much money as they can as quickly as they can and not worry about the consequences. And until that changes, I don't think there's a chance we're going to do anything good about this. There are exceptions when somebody's really, really bad. The way the Kanye West was this weekend, you will see politically it becomes impossible for these guys not to act, but the rest of the time they're going to do nothing. We'll see how long that ban lasts. Rodgers, you know California has acted when it comes to social media companies. And now section 230 at least is on the plate of the Supreme Court. How, if at all, do you think this could change the situation? You know, it's very, very hard to tell. Section 230 is incredibly important because what it does is it gives platforms the legal right to maintain the environment of their choosing. So that part of it's really, really good. Where I think things went off the rails is that the platforms chose because the economics were better to favor harmful content over good content. Basically hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories are extraordinarily profitable because they trigger flight or fight. So people have to pay attention. And in a business where attention is everything, that kind of content is going to rise to the surface repeatedly. So we have to change those incentives. I do not think 230 is the way to do that. I think the thing you have to do is to regulate the business market to Jasmine outside. Remember that's the big thing that a mayor who treats",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,81,2022-10-10 19:47:32
2968," eyes to the surface repeatedly. So we have to change those incentives. I do not think 230 is the way to do that. I think the thing you have to do is to regulate the business model, which is called surveillance capitalism, is this notion that you gather all the data about people and you use it to manipulate their choices and to manipulate their behavior. That must change. And we also have to have laws that require safety. The same way we require safety for transportation or healthcare or other things. We need to require safety around these platforms because the companies have to have an incentive to protect the people who use their systems. Roger from the conversations that you're having from people within the industry, from lawmakers, from what we're hearing, just from Capitol Hill. I guess how confident are you that we will actually see some change? And what does that mean then for some of the largest players in this space like meta and Twitter? I'm not at all confident. We are making progress, but it is incredibly slow in comparison to the damage that these companies are doing. And when I first started talking about this publicly in 2017, it was really obvious to me that that the issue was the culture, the business model and algorithms of platforms could undermine democracy and civil rights. I went to Congress in spring and summer of 2017 and then continued to push them to try to do something about it. More than five years have gone by. Several elections have gone by. An insurrection has gone by. A pandemic has been amplified. And yet nothing has been done. So I don't have a lot of confidence because the pressure from the public doesn't exist. And until people start saying, wait a minute, we rarely really value democracy. We really value our public health. We really value public safety. And we recognize that these companies are at danger. Nothing's going to happen. And Roger, as we saw with Twitter as they began badting people, we saw apps like Truth Social, some of these other more siloed avenues also pop up as well. What does that do to this picture when you're trying to monitor these different things but then having these different siloed platforms coming up as well? To be clear, I think that in the United States, people should be free to say the things that they feel and believe. But not all forms of speech are protected by the First Amendment. You're not allowed to yell fire in a crowded theater. You're not allowed to threaten elected officials. There are lines that people should not be allowed to cross. And the problem we have today is there is no enforcement of those lines. In fact, the lines, you know, I think everybody knows where they are. We just choose to not engage with it. And I don't know how we're going to solve that problem. I am hopeful. There is more progress today than there's been any time in the last five years. But it's so slow. And I do believe that politicians and frankly journalists and the citizens would rather not disrupt the convenience of the status quo to deal with hard problems like this. And I think it's a gigantic issue. And then there's the question Roger of what would Elon do? How will Elon Musk impact the situation you just described if and when he owns Twitter? So the exciting thing for investors is that it does appear that Elon Musk position in the Delaware Chance Record is very bad. So the odds of either a court decision or action by Musk to complete the deal are higher than they've been at any time in this process. And even if he finds a way to weasel out, it looks to me as though it's going to cost him more than just the breakup fee. So investors in Twitter are probably pretty well positioned in the short term. I can't say the same for America. I mean the problem with Twitter is they've done a horrible job for years in managing the discourse on the platform. And there's no evidence that Elon Musk has a plan to improve that. In fact, it's not clear what plan he has at all. And what has happened over the last couple of weeks is the disclosure by the court of the text conversations with prospective investors has been super embarrassing for those investors. And that creates some doubt about financing of the deal. And so I don't quite know how this is going to play out at the deal level. What I'm really worried about is that the company will go into a situation where not even investors will be able to have any influence on the outcome. And in that situation with somebody like Musk who seems to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,82,2022-10-10 19:51:44
2969," situation where not even investors will be able to have any influence on the outcome. And in that situation with somebody like Musk, who seems to rejoice in trolling others and seems to think that trolling is like a really positive value, that for platform where all of politics, all of journalism, and all of celebrity, does its communication, that's just going to produce terrible outcomes. And certainly be tested again in the midterm elections coming up. A big thank you to Roger McNamee for joining us this afternoon. Thank you so much. Alright, coming up, online sports betting is looking less and less like a winning play in California. We'll tell you what companies like Fandall are doing about it. Next. Music Unlike what did or did not happen to Tom Brady, a showers day wishing to stop at Fred Davis Power in time by reaching largest Loan He할 on Saturday for two. But what did all the weed and weight you gave out during the weekend on the show were delivered to the sports gambling industry. The Wall Street Journal reporting draft kings and Fando hardware. To the real bloody I think this is an interesting moment here for drafting to the Fandall, right? So the journals reporting that drafting's in Fandall have pulled some ad spending in relation to Proposition 27 in California, which had to do with mobilizing or legalizing mobile sports gambling. And that really kind of comes from what we've seen from the polls though, guys. So a poll released last week from Cal Berkwee's Institute of Governmental Studies said that 53% of people planned to vote no, while only 27% planned to vote yes. That's two to one. That is not good a month out from this vote, right? And really the problem in California is there's two propositions. There's Prop 27, which draft kings, Fandall, Bed MGM are backing. And then there's Prop 26, which the tribes in California are backing for kind of brick and mortar betting. Sources have told me that's the problem, because it's hard for some in the industry to back both. You want to be able to back both in this industry. You want to be on both sides. And some of the lobbyists can't be on both sides. So how that's sort of impacting the stock here, you can see draft kings is down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,83,2022-10-10 19:56:45
2970," Back both. You want to be able to back both in this industry. You want to be on both sides. And some of the lobbyists can't be on both sides. So how that's sort of impacting the stock here. You can see draft kings is down over 13% today. And one other thing I want to add on that, I talked to Jen Kelly over at Oppenheimer. He said this could be long-term good for stocks like draft kings though. It will give them more time to get to profitability. A lot of these analysts see profitability in the end of Q4 next year. If you get to profitability quicker if you're drafting you have more money to spend on opening in California. Something to think about with the liquidity. That's what a lot of the bears think about here is that liquidity. It's an interesting twist there. I was going to say why if you didn't just explain that Pajashat. We also need to get to another big story in the gaming space today. When you look at the performance inside the S&P, some of the biggest decliner's today, when Las Vegas Sands moving to the downside on a rise in COVID cases in China. Talk to us just about why this is such a concern here for these companies. Yeah, if you take a look at the one-month chart of these two companies, when in Las Vegas Sands, it really tells you the story, right? We were talking two weeks ago about how it goes up because they think that there's going to be more opening in China. And then you see it goes down today because COVID cases are back. It's just kind of a lot of teetering and towering right now. And people don't really know where its headed city group cut their revenue forecast for gross gaming revenue in Macau today this morning. And I think that's part of why you're seeing those stocks down. But a lot of uncertainty when it comes to the casino stocks in China. You remember just overlay the COVID cases in China against the stock chart? Yeah, I think they tripled over the weekend. Josh, good to see you man. Thank you. Good stuff. Coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stick with us right here on Yahoo Finance Law. All right. Just a couple of minutes away from the closing bell. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance this year. Blick read a breakdown today's market action. Hello, sir. Hello, not the best way to begin the week. But let's narrate it and has that down 1%. And let's get a two day rolling view. 10,575, 62 if it closes below that going to be the lowest since about the summer of 2020. And it looks like we're going to do that. So another negative headline about to be generated right here. Let's take a deep dive inside the market. Or it looks like we got a minute to go.

2971," and I get a headline about to be generated right here. Let's take a deep dive inside the market or it looks like we got a minute to go. We'll call this a shallow drive dive here to the spider sectors. We got staples in the lead, followed by industrials, materials and utilities. Those are the only ones in the green right now to the downside, energy taking up the rear spot here. That's down 2% followed by tech and real estate. You take a look at what the NASDAQ 100 is doing in some standouts, especially in the chips space with President Biden out cracking down on China once again and video down 3%. Software not doing much better. PayPal's down 6%. And let's get a check of the travel sector as well. Something a little bit non-correlated to tech. Here we see a mix board, but current will cruise lines down 5% win with that China exposure, down 12% Royal Caribbean, down 5% as we head into this closing dive. That wraps up today's trading action. Here to you look at all three of the major averages ending to the downside. The NASDAQ often just over 1% S&P off. 7% of a percent down off 93 points in terms of the sector action that Jared was just walking us through. Energy by far the worst performer in today's trading off just around 2%. We're also looking at losses from technology, real estate, and consumer discretionary. Let's talk about the recent market action and what we could expect going forward. For that, we want to bring in Deborah Cunningham, federated her knees, a chief investment officer of global liquidity markets. In Andrew Slimman, a Morgan Stanley investment management, senior portfolio manager. Andrew, let me start with you just in terms of the downside, I guess risk playing out in the market today. Once again, we are looking at losses. We saw a bit of optimism going back to a week ago today and what we saw in the trading action last Tuesday. How do you think things shake out from here between now and the end of the year? Well, I think near term, you have a very tough, competitive situation for equities, which is there's uncertainty about inflation. There's uncertainty about the Fed and there's uncertainty about earning. And on the meantime, you can go on by a two-year treasury at 4.3%. So it's tough for stock to really do well when assuredness of short-term yield curve looks pretty good. Later this year, if we get better inflation for it, so I think it's a better situation for equities. But I think it's tough near term that continues to weigh in the market. And there are as you mentioned some of that Fed uncertainty. To what degree is the Fed contributed to a lot of the uncertainty about really the path ahead that investors are now concerned about? Well, certainly I agree that inflation is ruling the roost from a standpoint of what the Fed's actions are. I think to some degree, they were very late in the game in the context of sticking with their thought that this was transitory until really just a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2021. So what you now have is a Fed, I think, that's continuing to play catch-up. And people look at mortgage rates and they say, oh, my goodness, they've doubled. And how are people, what is this going to do to the housing market? Or they look at short-term interest rates and say, just what we just heard, 4.3% for a very short-term government risk, yet when you look at something other than the last 10 to 12 years since the financial crisis, I mean, that was sort of more the norm from an interest rate perspective with inflation much less than it is today. So we got used to something with a low inflationary rate and to some degree, a zero premium over that low inflation rate that just is not continuing now. And we don't really see an end to it in the near term. So I think the Fed is in unison, whether it's chair Powell, whether it's the governors, whether it's the other voting members of the FOMC. They're in unison saying, this is our chief concern. And we are going to continue to battle this by increasing rates and releasing bonds off the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,85,2022-10-10 20:04:47
2972," our chief concern and we are going to continue to battle this by increasing rates and releasing bonds off the balance sheet. Both ways trying to quantitatively tighten as well as with monetary policy, tighten from an interest rate standpoint. I don't really see an end to that at this red hot moment. They're hoping for a good future. The first day, Andrew Hurricane Jamie Diamond out with his latest 69 months, the federal tippes in the recession. The markets have another 20% to fall. Your thoughts? Well, this has been the story all year. The economy has proven to be stronger than what people expected. The next day, the economy has been growing for a few months ago with all due respect. I think the real question is will it come to fruition if it does not. You know, stocks will recover. I can imagine that the tightening that the fed's done will continue. We'll not affect the stock market at some point. But the key point in maybe the stock market is, you know, there's so many stocks down 40, 50, 60%. That they're already reflecting a recession. I understand the S&P isn't at the cap-weighted index. That's because there's a few big stocks. They're only down 20% or last. But there are a lot of stocks that are reflective. I don't see that as tremendous downside for most stock could be for the S&P cap-weighted. Dipper, what do you think? How do you think this sets us up heading into earning season? We're starting to get a lot of the tech things over the next couple of weeks. When it comes to the surging dollar, the uncertainty when it comes to the fed. How do you see that impacting this round of earnings? We've been surprised quarter after quarter with earnings that we thought we were going to soften. We thought we were going to turn down. In fact, they have held out very large-scale earnings in the market. They're large global entities with lots of diversification that is working in their favor during this challenging time from an economic perspective. But that can only hold out for so long. Our expectations continues to be heading into the fourth quarter that we're going to see impact on earnings which ultimately then has a broader effect in the context of the earnings. So, we're going to see what the consequences of the issuers themselves. In this environment, you say we buy, fit, and sell greed. What does that mean in terms of the investment strategy right now? Well, I mean, the only consistency to my business right is the emotional element that brought the equity prices. Things swing to extreme. The first thing that I think of the first is that the first one was buying the travel leisure stock right into the mid to the pandemic when they prices, if no one was ever going to leave their house. Then energy futures went negative and boil boy now. Everyone loves energy. And then fast forward today, I think the fear is consumer sentiment is that of all time low. And those are those things that I think are going to be the most important part of the economy. But I don't think it's going to be tomorrow, but consumer sentiment is going to improve. But as I said before, a lot of consumer discretionary stock already priced in a recession. So, if in fact we do see some improvement, those stocks could have a lot of upside. I think greed, if flip-side, is going to be the top. I just think that there was more upside in other areas as that area has garnered and attracted a lot of money. So selling fear is all, I'm sorry, buying fear is all provide upside with the right time, probably more than",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,86,2022-10-10 20:09:16
2973, acted a lot of a lot of money. So selling fears all I'm sorry buying fears all provide up to with the right time for a more than trying to get involved with a group that's very crowded. In devil a big thank you to our market panel Deborah Cunningham and Adry Slimman thank you both for joining us this afternoon. All right coming up as the Biden administration is ramping up its battle with China over chips. A next guest says microchips are the new oil stay tuned to find out why.. Chips ox selling off today sending recent losses and video AMD Intel applied materials all hitting 52 week lows. Now US restrictions on China's access to chips and dire demand forecast. Ok those concerns out there that the sectors downturn may be longer and deeper than we initially thought. We want to bring Chris Miller the Fletcher School at Tufts Assistant Professor of International History and author of the chip war the fight for the world's most critical technology. Chris it's great to see you so these new curves from the Biden administration obviously adding to that bear sentiment out there on the street. I know you have been very closely tracking this global fight when it comes to chips. I guess what's your perspective of the new limitations that we got from the Biden administration? Well they are a sweeping set of restrictions on the sale of certain advanced chips to China as well as a whole set of chip making technologies that are really going to restrain China's advances in this sphere for some time to come. It will limit kind of ability for example to build out advanced data centers and deploy artificial intelligence. The risk of course that it also spurs China to invest even more in domesticating its own chip technology but for at least,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,87,2022-10-10 20:13:14
2974," centers and deploy artificial intelligence. And the risk, of course, that it also spurs China to invest even more in domesticating its own tip technology. But for at least the next couple of years, China will find it very difficult to get around these rules. They'll hurt some US shipforms with will hurt China even more. And what about just the risk of retaliation, too, right? As we have this escalating tension between the US and China? What's certainly a possibility we can't rule it out? It is worth noting, I think, that in the past when the US has rolled out comparable restrictions in terms of the transfer of tax to Chinese firms, like when the US restricted the sale of chips to Huawei in 2020, China did nothing in retaliation. So if that's any guide, China might not do much this time, of course. This is a more dramatic action than even the assault on Huawei in 2020. So it's possible China could change course. But the reality is that China still needs US chip, even though certain types of chips are no longer possible to sell the China, China spends more money importing chips than it spends importing oil. And that's been the case for the past decade. And so the Chinese realize they're in a weak position here. They've got, have acted chips made in the US or chips made in Taiwan or South Korea that are based on US technology. And unless the Commerce Department of the United States gives them approval, that all could be cut off. Well, and Chris, going off with that, the fact that China has spent more on chips than they have spent on oil. I guess just in terms of what is the potential fallout when we start to think about the economic consequences of this? Well, there are some foreign companies that will be hit US chip firms or chip makers in Taiwan, for example. But the biggest impact will be felt by China's own tech firms because for a long time, investors have been betting that Chinese firms in the AI space, for example, or in chip making will be able to continue to import technology from the US and other Western countries that they need to improve their capabilities. And now all of that is being called into question. The chip war has really escalated. And now it's not clear that China is going to have access to the most advanced data center technologies for the next couple of years and maybe the next decade. So in that sense, the US is really putting the choke on China's event, computing capabilities, and Chinese firms that had hoped to roll out artificial intelligence across their operations will face more and more limitations than that regard. Because the cost of AI will be very expensive, very power-intensive without the most advanced chips. And as of last week's action, China will be unable to access these semiconductors. It's clearly a massive headwind and challenge here for China. In terms of creating their own semiconductor industry, obviously, they like far behind when you compare it to where we are here in the US. How long do you think it will potentially take them to catch up? We're talking at least a fair number of years and potentially over a decade. They actually may never catch up, given the amount of capital investment involved, given the really specialized machine tools that today can only be bought from the US or Japan or the Netherlands. Today, China is a big player in the electronics market, but when it comes to chips, China is less than 10% of value at across the industry. And so if we're trying to domesticate all of this technology, it's really extraordinarily difficult and expensive prospects, which is why they've been very openly relying on chip-making technologies, as well as that chips from abroad for some time. This is not an industry you can just build from scratch overnight. Well, Chris, speaking of, I guess, of the expense of it, the cost of it to build out your own semiconductor industry. How does that compare to other sectors here in the US, just in terms of the cost and what it's going to take in order to potentially have an industry that's comparable to what we have here in the US? Well, the cost is really extraordinary. A new chip-making facility that's producing processor chips and memory chips can cost $20 billion, making them the most expensive factories in human history. There's really almost nothing that compares to a facility that's able to manufacture billions and billions of transistors each one smaller than a coronavirus. This is the most complicated, precise manufacturing in history, which is why the race to dominate this sector is so intense and so expensive. And we've seen earlier iterations of the chip war between different companies. That's why I called the book the chip war. And we found that only a couple of companies have been able to keep up thus far all relying on US and Japanese technology in particular.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,88,2022-10-10 20:18:01
2975," that called the book The Chip War. And we found that only a couple of companies have been able to keep up thus far all relying on US and Japanese technology in particular. So for Canada to do this from scratch about access to foreign technology, would just be very tough. Well, this is clearly a priority here for the Biden administration recently passing the Chips Act of Move here in order to try and entice chip makers to manufacture chips here within the United States. I guess what's key in terms of making sure that this actually succeeds here in the US? I think it's pretty clear we're going to have more manufacturing of chips in the US. Thank to the incentive, $40 billion worth of incentives provided by the Chips Act. But the reality is that today, 90% of the most advanced processor chips can only be made in Taiwan. And so even despite that, we're spending more money to entice chip makers to build new facilities here, we're still going to be reliant on Taiwan to build our most advanced chips for some time to come. The Chips Act is a good idea. I think I support the legislation. But we need to be realistic about what it can accomplish. Given that one advanced facility can cost $20 billion, $40 billion only gets us so far in an industry where capital investment is just very expensive. It's a good point there. Chris Miller, great to have you author of Chip War, the fight for the world's most critical technology. Thanks so much for joining. Our convests, Kathy Wood, taking aim at the Federal Reserve at a new open letter saying the central bank has shocked not just the US, but the world and raised the risks of a deflationary bust. Alexander Semenova is here with more. Not entirely clear what prompted her to write this letter. What is she else to she saying? What does she want the Fed to do? Well, Dave, for starters, if Kathy Wood has something to say you better believe that she will find a creative way to get her messaging across, this time, she had something to say to Federal Reserve officials. So she did the most Kathy Wood things she can do and penned an open letter to the US central bank. She argued that they're making a big mistake by overhiking rates and that FOMC members are using lagging indicators to dictate their policy decisions, specifically citing employment and what she referred to as a downstream inflation and said that overhiking rates risks a deflationary bust. Now, even as key price measures like CPI and PCE continue to come in stubbornly high, she insists that declining prices in some commodities like lumber and copper actually suggest that we're heading toward deflation. She also notes that the Monthly Jobs report which again showed robust hiring last month isn't telling the full story and pointed to increasing jobless claims and job openings. Now, obviously the speculative text docs that comprise ARC and invest ETFs are taking a big hit from the Federal Reserve. So she's continuously been sending this message across, but the point here is that what she says in the letter is not that far off now from Wall Street appears to be thinking as well, which is that the Fed is overshooting now. She made a point that rising food prices are caused by the war in Ukraine and that these are factors that the Fed can't actually resolve by tightening monetary policy. Now, the interesting thing is BlackRock actually had a similar message. They also said that the Fed is trying to combat factors that are contributing to inflation, that they can't fix with raising interest rates. So when you have ARC invest and BlackRock on the same page, that's pretty significant here. Three straight 75s, safe to say we're gonna hear from her again after what looks like a fourth 75 point hike in a row, Alexander Seminova. Thank you, great stuff.

2977," when gas prices soared and hit $5 this year, consumer confidence went exactly the other way and just about the same proportion and then consumer confidence improved as gas prices declined. We are now seeing upward pressure again on gasoline prices. We were talking last week about this production cut that the OPEC plus nations announced that Saudi Arabia plus Russia and a bunch of others mostly in the Middle East. That is already putting upward pressure on gasoline prices and I think the Biden administration is going to be desperate to keep gas prices at least on an average basis below $4 by the time of the midterm elections on November 8. That release of oil from the US strategic reserve was supposed to end in October but without saying much about it, the Biden administration has now extended some amount of oil releases into November time clearly at the midterm elections and it's also possible they could release a little bit more oil just to keep gas prices down leading up to November 8. There is not a lot of Biden can do on this but that's one thing to look for as for overall inflation. We have one more report coming on that this week and we will see what that has to say about what prices are like and how the Federal Reserve is likely to respond. There was one costly fist bump with MBS in the long term. One of the inability for the Biden administration that will really forever haunt them Rick no matter what the issue is is an inability to sell anything in particular infrastructure and a lot of their accomplishments. What do you expect the final push to be from the Biden administration on their achievements? I think they are going to keep it simple Dave I think it's going to be 10 million jobs and then Biden gives a speech he gets into the fine print the fine print is yes we pass the inflation reduction act if it's called the inflation reduction act though why is an inflation lower. He's got some explaining to do on that he did pass some bills and I think voters on the margins do give him credit for getting some of those things done. You can see it if you get deep into the polling data but Americans just don't feel like things are going right and I think that when inflation is hot you know we forgot about the corrosive impact that inflation can have on consumer attitudes because we haven't had to deal with this really since the late 1970s. We're getting a reminder all over again that inflation is really ruinous it put it in a side to put in addition to reducing purchasing power and basically shrinking people's paychecks it just puts everybody in an nasty mood. So I think we have to see inflation come down to the range of 5% before voters start to feel better about it and there's no way that's going to happen by November. No way indeed thanks as always our very own Rick Newman thanks for joining us.

Well this application releases like an album drop no one knows everyone's been reaching out to the Department of Education to the White House. You don't know so it's going to be one of these things we're unfortunately borrowers are going to be finding out probably via tweet like we did about loan forgiveness and even though the education department says that they've short up their website so it won't crash. I think this will be it in an edbreaker one of the things that borrowers need to understand is even though the loan application should come out any day in October it is highly recommended that if this long forgiveness package doesn't wipe out all your debt. That you try to complete the application by November why because forbearance ends December 31st and you resume payments in January so you want to apply early to allow your loan servicer enough time to recalculate your balance and give you your new monthly payment. You have until the end of 2023 to apply but the longer you wait the longer it takes to process so particularly if you have outstanding debt after loan forgiveness be sure to apply early. Now the other thing is people have had questions that 125 income.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,91,2022-10-10 20:30:47
2978," and just be sure to apply early. Now, the other thing is people have had questions that 125 income cap is at AGI. We are hearing from sources that is based on your adjusted gross income. So that could change too, because there again, it hasn't been confirmed, sources say. So that's another thing. One thing that borrowers need to understand. It is not enough for you to simply go on the website and sign up for the subscription notification. You need to go on the studentaid.gov site, and make sure that your account information is in the system properly. Well, that's lots of great stuff. Hopefully everyone's screenshot it some of those dates there so they can keep track. Everyone, make sure you do that. And hopefully the website holds up as well. Rondelly, thanks so much. Guys. All right, a small advocacy group of the job creators and network foundation filing a new lawsuit aimed at halting President Biden's student debt program, the latest in a series of similar suits that we have seen in recent weeks. Shahoe Finance is Alexis Keenan. Drinks is now with the details on that. Hey, Alexis. Hi, Shana. To Rondis' point about doing this early pay attention, because this lawsuit and the others like it, could have some bearing on whether or not people actually get their hands on this money that they may be eligible for. So this particular case coming from job creators network, it is an advocacy group for small business, but it's got two named plaintiffs in the lawsuit. One of these plaintiffs is eligible for the, or partially eligible for the forgiveness. The other one, not eligible at all. So this is filed in the federal district court for the Northern District of Texas. And they're saying that at the heart of the case, that this executive order coming from President Biden to offer this forgiveness, that it violates the American Procedures Act. Now, that act requires notice and comment periods for certain rule makings, but whether it applies the executive orders that has perhaps not been challenged in this type of case. Now, the plaintiffs say that the forgiveness eligibility is arbitrary. They say it's unequal, that the measures adopted by the administration and where to draw those lines about AGI, adjusted gross income, and other factors that determine whether you're eligible. They say that those are just unequal and arbitrary. Also, these plaintiffs say that the universities should really be the ones that are held accountable for prices being so high and for students being in the position that they're in today. They also say that the order is really just a ploy to drum up support for November elections. But look, there is a stay that these plaintiffs are requesting. So what that means is they want this forgiveness to be put on hold while their lawsuit is pending. And that could be a problem because if a court grants that, then that would perhaps bring to a halt the government dishing out this money to the eligible recipients. So as Rhonda said, those single filers will be allowed to apply when this application comes out up to $125,000 married in head of household filers up to $250,000. Guys, certainly an important story to continue to watch right. Alexis Keenan, thanks so much. Coming up, the world mental health day, the CEO of Headspace Health, that tells us how it's trying to get people get the ball rolling when it comes to taking care of their own mental health. It joins us next......",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,92,2022-10-10 20:35:17
2979," Pike Today is World Mental Health Day, a day for raising awareness of mental health issues and giving us all an opportunity to rekindle our efforts to make mental health a priority. Headspace Health CEO, Russ Glass, with us now to talk about this. Good to see you, sir. The numbers are staggering. 20% of employees, according to Gallup, 20% are engaged at work. I don't know if this is the quiet quitting trend or not. Are employers doing enough to help with mental health? Clearly, they're not. I think that we saw a big spike during the pandemic where employers realized they had to focus on this. They didn't have a choice. But 25% of employees tell us now that the focus on it has gone down. That employers aren't as focused on it right now. And yet what we see is that the mental health pandemic is not slowing down, right? Even though maybe the actual pandemic, the COVID pandemic is slowing down. We're seeing a continued acceleration in need. And that's what World Mental Health Day is all about. It's how do we make sure people understand that this is still a critical need, that we need to be focusing on it. And our mission is how do we transform the mental health space to break down some of these barriers that people face in getting mental health care today? Because once there is this recognition about mental health, but it doesn't seem to translate perhaps into what some of these businesses could or should be doing. Or is there a discount also between people feeling comfortable enough using the resources that their companies are offering as well? Well, let's start with the facts. The World Health Organization estimates there's about a billion people that have a diagnosed mental health condition. And 60% of them are not getting care. And that's because of access issues. They can't find providers. It's because of cost issues. It's just too expensive when they do find a provider. And then there's all kinds of stigma issues. People are still not comfortable saying, hey, I have an issue that I really need help with. And so employers have to recognize that they have a huge percentage of their employees that are struggling right now. Some estimates are about 40% of employees are struggling with mental health. We have seen that 50% of employees are thinking about leaving work because of mental health issues right now. And so we know employers have to be focused on it. We are trying to raise awareness today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,93,2022-10-10 20:39:43
2980," thinking about leaving work because of mental health issues right now. And so we know employers have to be focused on it. We are trying to raise awareness today. We are running live meditations throughout the week. We're doing, ask me anything for our client base, our 4,000 companies around the world that are accessing our mental health care. We did a partnership with 24 hour fitness to create the environment for their, uh, members to access this. We did a partnership with Pinterest. We're really trying to create awareness so that employers realize this is something you have to invest in and it'll drive positive return on investment in addition to supporting their employees. And certainly is very critical and very important. You're given the numbers that you were just citing. Russ, when it comes to what companies are doing, things that do work, we've talked about mental health days. We know Nike had given all their employees a week off. And hopefully other companies are setting aside and needing free times. What's your advice just in terms of what companies can do throughout the year to make sure that they are staying on top of this? Great question. Few things. One is make sure that the leaders of the company are talking about it. If, if, if the leaders are willing to say, Hey, you know, I've had anxiety throughout my career. I've had to manage issues like this. It helps destigmatize it for everybody else. So that's number one, find leaders that are willing to talk about it. Two then is provide training for leadership for managers. One of the most uncomfortable things is having a conversation and saying, Hey, how are you doing and being afraid of the answer? Right? Someone says to you, Yeah, you know, I'm actually feeling pretty depressed. And you as a manager, don't know how to respond to that. That can be super uncomfortable. So what we find is managers don't, don't talk about it. So provide training. We're, we're providing leadership workshops, for example, the help companies figure out like, how do we have these conversations? And then number three, make sure employees understand what's available to them. What we find is 94% of CEOs say they're doing enough for mental health. Only 67% of employees agree. That's a huge gap. And mostly we believe it's due to communication that it launches once. They never talk about it again. And when an employee really needs it, they don't know it's available for them. So communication, constant reinforcement of these, these resources being available. Maybe I can help with stigma. I struggled daily with anxiety. I have no problem admitting that I meditate every single day. It helps to see world mental health day trending on Twitter all day, which tells you maybe the stigma is changing a little bit. Cost and access to the two other factors that you mentioned. What can be done about those? Well, we're trying to do a few things. One is we've launched a few programs today. One is our referral program where anybody with a headspace account can now refer to as many friends as they want for 30 days free. So that's launching today. We are also creating a my headspace campaign. And people can share their stories via social media. But they can talk about how they have handled their own anxiety, depression, mental health issues and what they've done to help solve it. Just help people feel like they're not alone out there. To your point, I love the fact that you're willing to talk about it. And because everybody has mental health, everybody needs to think about this. And the more that we can feel comfortable talking about it, the better. More broadly, we have to think about creating more resource for our communities, particularly those who are underserved. How do we get resources into those communities? You know, today, 50% of US counties have zero mental health providers within county lines. We just can't continue to operate this way. And that's where we're really focused. How do we drive up the amount of care that can be delivered per therapist, psychiatrists, provider that's out there? Definitely feeling those shortages. My dad is a psychiatrist, he retired and came back because there is such a need. So appreciate the work that you're doing and all our mental health providers out there. Thank you so much for us, glass. All right, well, coming up, hello, Alice is looking to help small businesses across the US grow. The company CEO tells us how they plan to do it next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,94,2022-10-10 20:43:51
2981," We're coming up. Hello Alice is looking to help small businesses across the US grow. The company CEO tells us how they plan to do it next. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. We're looking to help small businesses across the US grow. There seems to be one unanimous truth about starting a small business. It is hard. We're looking to help small businesses grow by offering funding, education and opportunities to entrepreneurs. We're joining us now is Elizabeth Gore, hello Alice co-founder president along with Russell Jackson, restaurant owner and chef of reverence. Thank you both for joining me today. Elizabeth for people who are trying to get familiar with what your company does. How do you serve small businesses and how does the pandemic change that? It's great to be with you all. At hello Alice, we help ensure the financial health of any small business. We help you access credit, grants, information, technical assistance and most of all each other. You can learn from people like Chef Jackson who is with us today. We are here at hello Alice all about your financial health. Russell speaking of health, I mean six months before the COVID pandemic hit, you came out of retirement and opened your restaurant. I can't even imagine once the pandemic started to take hold what it was like to try and access capital in those very early stages. Walk us through that. Yeah, what was I thinking, right? I've been trying to say the least, I think that for myself as a 40 year professional actually coming out of your time and to do this, I'd never spent a single day, a single hour training to every day a day? Okay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,95,2022-10-10 20:47:46
2982," And for myself as a 40 year professional, actually coming out of your time and to do this, I'd never spent a single day as single hour training for what we've been through for the last two years. And thanks to Hello Allis, I mean first and foremost, they were the first people to step in beyond Nick, Nicholas and Talk to step up and help us. And if it wasn't for Hello Allis, I wouldn't be standing inside this building today. So I'm very fortunate and blessed that we found them and they found us, I guess. I mean, it seems like it's a very well-matched pair here. And Russell, I do want to just follow up because obviously a lot of restaurants struggling with things like labor shortages. We're seeing wages go up. People still trying to compete for staff. How's that affecting your business at the moment? Well, this restaurant was purpose built and we built it around the idea of creating the best efficiencies that we could. So we're a small, small house. Right now we currently got three full-time staff members and two part-time staff members. And we can provide a high level of Michelin level service and high-profile dining, a tasting menu program that you, you know, we can compete with the big boys and going in with that thought and having to deal with some of the ups and downs, we're plagued by it like the rest. You know, we've had difficulties with supply chain. We've had difficulties, we're having difficulties with inflation. Scalp for a great example, we're 16 to 20 dollars a pound, pre-pandemic. They're not, they at the height during the pandemic were $60 a pound wholesale for the quality that we deal with. Yeah, wow. This is an understatement. Should have seen the bill on that one. And, you know, we've worked very, very hard to manage our way through this entire process. And again, without the advice and the support of some teams like Hello Alice, I mean, we had a tremendous amount of difficulty getting into and getting our second PPP alone. And if we were waiting for them stepping in and advocating for us and giving us a path to that, we wouldn't have had that amount of money that helped us to bridge the gap to sort of the next early path as we've been going through all this. And don't, don't misunderstand pandemics not over. We're still reeling, you know, small businesses and especially small restaurants are still violently struggling to survive on a day-to-day basis. You know, you may drive by and see a place full, but I'll tell you, for every one place that you see full, there are 50 that are empty. And so, yeah, I mean, Elizabeth, I want to bring you in here because obviously there's a lot of restaurants and companies that you work with. And I know that you recently teamed up with Square to really explore some of the challenges and some of the unique opportunities that Hispanic businesses face. Talk about some of the findings from that study and what you hope to really achieve with that as you try and get more funding and more opportunities for Hispanic business owners. Well, Hello Alice, we are left, you know, on company ourselves. And so we obviously take great pride in women, people of color, US veterans who are leading our companies. And the Hispanic community has over 5 million businesses with 800 billion contributing to our economy. However, we continue to see a huge lack of equitable access to credit, business loans, and then, you know, the things that are hitting every small business owner like inflation, as Chef said, hiring issues and so on. So if you're really going to help these, I love the way Chef says, Lily Pads hopped for one capital continuum to the next. We really have to put forward more equitable access to capital. So what Square and Hello Alice found is that grants are still critically important. So government grants, philanthropic grants, and small business owners. Second is access to credit solutions like operational credit. We are big fans of secured credit as well. And then finally, cashflow is king. So how are we helping small business owners with technical assistance on the Hello Alice platform, ensuring money in and money out is a smart use of funds. But I will tell you the other thing we found in the Latinx Hispanic community.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,96,2022-10-10 20:52:31
2983," the full assistance on the HELLOAS platform, ensuring money in and money out is a smart use of funds. But I will tell you the other thing we found in the Latinx Hispanic community is this huge sense of optimism. They're opening companies three times at the rate of their white male counterparts. It is an exciting time. There's also an increase sense of spend around software solutions. So there's, I think we are betting on the right groups when we look at women and people of color, particularly the black and Hispanic community. And also congratulations on teaming up with Mastercard and first national bank of Omaha as well. The way it comes to business credit because I know that is not easy. And we'll have to leave it there with a big thank you Elizabeth Gaw and Russell Jackson, chef. Great to have you on both of you. Thank you so much. I'm busy. Thank you. Appreciate it. For sure. All right, coming up the new battle for streaming platforms. Family friendly content. We have a closer look just ahead. All right. All right. Well, it's talk streaming now. Hulu raising subscription prices today. Yahoo. Finances. Ali canal here with the details. How much Ali? Yeah, Dave. So these price hides they were first announced back in August, but today they are hitting those subscriptions. So here's where you're looking at if you're a Hulu subscriber. Add supported will now cost $7.99 a month. That's up from the previous $6.99. Whereas the ad free version will run two bucks more 1499 versus 1299. Now that bundled plan that also includes Disney plus and ESPN plus that's safe for now, but it will see a price increase later this year. Now price X of course, they're not uncommon for these streaming platforms Netflix, Hiked prices in January, Hulu had a previous price hike around the same time last year. And with analyst hyper focused on profitability, this is one way to increase that revenue per user. However, the one issue is that these platforms always run the risks of increased churn. So that's something that we're going to be monitoring moving forward. But for now, if you're a Hulu subscriber, you're paying just a bit more today. And Ali, we know the box office saw some so, so, so sort of lukewarm results for Sony's Li容ide L<|fr|><|translate|> cozy and All Night People's Wat Stillers ignites you. Wast It Lost Love我知道 ®",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvHvxXHIc5I,97,2022-10-10 20:57:08
2984," the loser subscriber you're paying just a bit more today. And Ali, we know the box office saw some so, so, so, sort of lukewarm results for Sony's Liolile crocodile. So how does that add to the shaky outlook for some of these family-friendly titles that they get? Yeah, it's a much different landscape for these types of movies. Liolile saw a box office haul this weekend of 11.5 million. It had a production budget of 50 million. So not the best debut, especially as we often see attendance levels drop off as the weeks go on. And I think honestly, it's just a reflection of this post pandemic, theatrical environment. There are only going to be 14 family-friendly movies in 2022. We have two more to go before the end of the year. And that's a pretty significant dip versus 24 of those titles that we saw in 2019. And one big reason for that is that this genre is moving over to streaming. Paramount plus, Disney plus, even Netflix have heavily invested in this type of content in some cases, spending a heck of a lot of money to secure these types of films, focus, focus to on Disney plus was a big one recently. Disenchanted coming soon on Netflix. We'll have the school for good in evil out next week. And moving forward, I think it's just going to be a conscious decision on the part of studios when it comes to where these movies go. Streaming or the theater? Are you leaving money on the table going right to streaming or some of these movies better suited for the theatrical? I think that's going to be a constant question and there's going to be a lot more experimentation moving forward. It's true. Everyone's still trying to figure it out. A big thank you, Ali. Can now. Thanks so much. I mean, I know for me when it comes to some of these streaming things, especially kids movies, you figure you pay for the one subscription. You've got your treats at home. You just sit back. I'm one of these people. I'm going the streaming route. If I can help it, it's going to take a lot for me to go to the movies for kids. For kids movie. I'm like, if I can get it at home. Yeah, I mean, it's not a question that I am going to streaming route here. I mean, I would have done this even if the pandemic didn't happen and people didn't get more used to just streaming movies in their own home. I had never really been a huge fan of going to the movies, but from a parents perspective, bringing my kids to the movies, it's going to be a huge cost-saver. How expensive is it for the movies? Yeah. $20 a ticket? Honestly, I don't know. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. $17 a ticket. It's Black Panther November 11, Avatar December 16. That's it. I don't know. I don't know if it's going to get me back. All right, well, that's going to do a press today on Yahoo Finance Live. Be sure to come back tomorrow at 3 p.m. Eastern Time.

2989," Given that you've seen this before, you've seen this in the past, but for crypto this time and the amount of holdings that you do have, do you plan on kind of selling any of that, liquidating any of that in order to just sure up the coffers of cash in order to make sure that your businesses can also navigate. You know, we luckily sold over a billion dollars of stuff last year at better prices and certainly don't want to get into the business of burning the furniture to run the business. And so we're going to try to manage our business towards what we think our rational revenue targets. Listen, revenue is coming down in the industry. Volumes are down. Excitement is down in this winter could last longer than people think it might be shorter. It's hard, it's hard to predict when these crypto winners, how long they go. We're a couple years from a having cycle, I do think the fed flinching creates some enthusiasm around Bitcoin as a store of value Bitcoin as a recession as an inflation hedge as a hard money when the rest of the world keeps printing money. But we're going to manage our business to what we think is a rational revenue stream for our five operating businesses is trying to try to keep the balance sheet separate. If we sort of think of the 19th period in the 1960s to 1980 for the stock market is sort of a worst case scenario for what this bear market could look like across the equities market and crypto. I was sort of curious, you know, how do you think a crypto investor should operate in this environment that period of time sort of likened as sort of excellent for stock pickers. What do you think? How are you evaluating crypto currencies? Yeah, listen, in some ways, this is the most challenging macro environment for any investor. And if you had all the foresight of the sages, you would have just been in US dollar cash all year long, right when the whole world was saying cash is trash, cash is trash was time to just go long, you know, one week T bills and wait or go short markets. We're in a mess globally, right? Japan has got a monster imbalance, intervening in their currency market while supporting an interest rate market as inflation slowly creeps higher. That is a potential real problem. You saw what happened in the UK and they're trying to get this genie back in the box. But once confidence breaks down, it's really hard to get it back. And so what the Fed is doing is trying to preserve confidence in the US system. Now what they need. And we'll see if you get it is a Congress that is willing to take some pain. And politicians are not normally coded to take pain, right? So you already see in France, hey, we're going to do a hundred billion dollar subsidy because energy prices are too high. And hence that's driving inflation. So we're going to give more money to the system, like that's counter intuitive. I understand where it comes from people are suffering. And as you use printed dollars or printed euros in this case, you know, it creates this inflation cycle. And so it's a really treacherous market, you know, could the S&P what's it 30, whatever, 3600 today, could it end the year at 3,300, 3,300, and it looks like where the chart would go. And part about these environments is they don't get there straight line, right? There is a tremendous amount of fear in the market right now. And so like on Monday, we already saw 6% rally in it got reversed. It doesn't feel to me that the stock market lowers in that we're going to have more pain before we we see clear sailing. And, you know, there is a chance that even when the Fed thinks it's finished. And if the if the federal government doesn't tighten its belt and starts feeling this populism surge, you know, the cycle picks up again. And so I would say for now until the next, you know, until further notice, at least 12 months, these are going to be really complicated markets to trade and complicated money markets to make money in. And in some ways, just preserving your wealth is a huge win right not actually having monster gates.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,1,2022-10-11 13:55:56

Not actually having monster gains, but not losing money could be a huge win. All right. I'm going to need to grab my parter and build a bear teddy. Your mic appreciate it. It's so much for me. For me. Maybe I'll mark the low for you guys. Good stuff there. Alex, a digital founder, NCEO, Mike Novgeraz, that's Mike got to have you back here sometime soon. Appreciate the conversation as well as Yahoo Finance's own David Hollerith. Thank you both. Thanks, guys. Coming up, everyone, Jared Blyckery of Yahoo Finance is going to break down the Lake Is Market Action as investors brace for Ernie season. That's next. Coca-Cola getting high marks from its presentation and crowd sizes at the annual National Association of Convenience Store Conference. Now that has peaked the interest of Sasi ahead of Coca-Cola's earnings release. That's going to be on October 25th. That's where we find the stake today, South. We do here. We find other secure conferences like the National Convenience Store Conference in like bringing these reports to life. So shout out to Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein, which puts together a report of what Coca-Cola did there. It looks like Robert went to the event. It was well, well traffic. Let's fire off some photos here because you're looking at the next generation of Coca-Cola on many respects. You're seeing a smart coffee machine on screen right now that is a new cost of brand that they bought a couple years ago. You're seeing them also innovate more with new cans. You're seeing now that Coke freestyle machine up to now 200 different flavor options there. And then one of my phase right here, the body armor brand which Coke bought now coming in 28 ounce bottles with 140 milligrams of caffeine. Sign me up for all that stuff. So again, I think you would see a more focused Coca-Cola right here really starting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,2,2022-10-11 14:00:05
2991," In 28 ounce bottles with 140 milligrams of caffeine, sign me up for all that stuff. So again, I think you're seeing a more focused cocoa color right here, really starting to bring or crank up its innovation engine into next year. Now why is all this important? Why should we care about what's happening at the National Convenient Store conference as it pertains to cocoa color? While a couple stats on the board here, Convenient Store has a count for about 10 to 14% of coax North America sales. Convenient Store has a count for about 15 to 20% of coax North America profits. A large presence there, of course. And approximately half of the US adult population shops each day at a convenience store and likely buys something from a cocoa color. And of course, it's main rival PepsiCo, which will be getting their earnings out tomorrow morning. Overall, speaking of earnings, cocoa color will report earnings in a couple weeks. I whipped up a nifty checklist here if you guys do store away as you prepare for this earnings report. The strong dollar may hammer sales and profits. Of course, cocoa is a global player and they will very much likely to be exposed, exposed to that strong dollar, just like we heard from Nike a couple weeks ago when they reported. Consolation brands, we just talked to CEO Bill Nulens. Their earnings were strong, suggest that increased mobility might have helped cocoa color as well. Our price increases sticking. We saw from Konagra when they reported earnings in McCormick last week. Food companies are pushing through price increases. And for right now, they appear to be sticking. Good thing for margins. And last but not least, any signs of inflation rolling over. I mentioned that Konagra report last week. There were signs that inflation was starting to cool down a little bit. And my take here, more focused cocoa is ultimately a good thing for investors into next year. There I am holding a full calorie cocoa. Now what you don't see here is really over the past year or so, James Quincy, the CEO of Cocoa Cola, has really streamlined that product portfolio, really got them focused on what they should be doing, which is a body armor, which is cork cocoa, which is unique cans and not selling things I believe like tab that nobody really wants. What's remarkable is that we always had been talking about for years when there was kind of a war on sugar. If you will, and some of the more sugary drinks that were falling out of the consumer, either diet or fanfare or just kind of the affinity to those high sugary drinks, Coca-Cola pivoted. Coca-Cola is one of the only companies that has the amount of cash possible to really deploy in the beverage space to either build something out in-house or go out and acquire a brand. And I think that's really been a really good competitive positioning for them. Of course, it does come with the size of Coca-Cola to make that possible. But that's a significant consideration for how they've been able to kind of steer the ship over these past few years as consumer taste trends change. Yeah, it's interesting to see that. Charter, we're just showing how Coca-Cola shares have been outperforming PepsiCo, but again, we'll hear about them tomorrow. We'll be talking to CFO Hugh Johnston in front of our programming. Very curious to see how they did in his volatile backdrop. Curious of, wow, wow, was represented at that convenient store. I'm sure they were.

Stocks are down. They are not up as traders ultimately await that CPI index read later in the week which could come in hot and perhaps put further pressure on stocks. But let's stay on the stock market here more broadly. The Dow Jones industrial average is often seen as the most commonly used metrics for stocks but the average US household and it would appear that households are taking interest in the market again as the year winds down. Google searches for Dow Jones have picked up over the last month according to the folks at Data Trek Research. My friend and former Boston Kramer tweeted a good point to me on this chart today.

2993," Live from the Greenwich economic forum, now markets are back in a bad mood ahead of Thursday's important consumer price index reading, ongoing weakness in European and Asian markets. We're also seeing that way on sentiment as well. Right now all three major indices are in the red. And here's what's on tap for this hour. These Amazon stock prime for gains, Amazon Prime Day two is in full effect today. We'll check in with one analyst to see if the spending event will boost Amazon's beat up stock price. And Wall Street out in force pre-earnings. We got the details on a bullish new call on Chipotle and a less than happy call on Zoom. And Channing at Wales, our Julie Jaime will speak with Churchill asset management founder and CEO Ken Kencel from the always high end event known as the Greenwich economic forum. But first, Brad, let's get over to you at the Yahoo Finance Interactive for a look at all things markets. Yeah, thanks so much, Todd. Well, just putting a little more context into today's decline. There you saw, at about 10 a.m. hour, we bounced off of some of the intraday session lows for the Dow Jones industrial average as of right now. We're still lower by about three tens of a percent, though. Taking a look at the Nasdaq composite, you're also seeing that lower by about one and a half percent here intraday and still in the same ballpark of some of those early session lows as we're just about 37 minutes into today's trading activity here on this Tuesday. The S&P 500, that too, down a little more than 1%. Taking a look, though, a little further into some of the travel names that we've been tracking. And there's really only one bright spot. And it's barely holding on to some of those gains that had come as a result of an update. That from American Airlines. It's holding on to gains by the hair of its chin and chin and chin right now. That compared to being up by 4% pre-market. And so now you're seeing some of that sputtering out, but continue to watch this broader travel and kind of reopening play, if you will, because even though some of the demand that the airlines have cited as being strong, even though some of that demand persists and the taking price from, and in the midst of this kind of higher demand, taking price to consumers and having consumers still accept that, even though that's locked into place, it's still a question of what the capacity will look like for them. And so that's something that American had talked about. And now you're seeing AAL dip into the red, but more broadly, continue to watch Airbnb. That's down by about 6% here on the day. Some of the other travel names that are declining, EXPE, Expedia, also move and lower by a little more than, well, nearly 4%. Shifting gears and watching shares of Amazon, though, as they kick off their second prime day event, shares are lower by about 2.5% right now. What our next guest calls bridging the gap between the back to school and the holiday shopping periods for more on prime day. We welcome in, Cowan Managing Director and Senior Analysts Covering Internet and New Media, John Blackledge, John, great to have you here. Happy prime day sequel to you, I suppose, as we kick off the holiday season sales even earlier, and it always gets earlier and earlier, and there's more names that even get looped in to this broader sales blitz, if you will. How do you expect this to pan out for Amazon, knowing that so much of the e-commerce push that they have? This is just going to be a larger break even type of push that they're looking for in order to just get rid of some of this inventory, and perhaps get some new signups on the prime front. Yeah, it kicks off the holiday season for the company. Remember last year, it was an earlier holiday season with the supply chain issues. This year, it's a little bit different, right? I mean, more macro headwinds for the consumer, so it'll be interesting to see how the consumer holds up throughout it. But you have, like you just said, that in stock levels are good. Arguably, there's a glut of inventory across the retail landscape, which could lead to kind of higher discounting than previous holiday seasons. But I think for Amazon, a couple of things. In stock levels are good, and their delivery speeds are back at three pandemic levels. That's what they told us at two-q earnings, and that should only really improve for the company. Remember, Amazon invested about $80 billion in their fulfillment and logistics infrastructure since 2020. That included quadrupling their last mile of delivery stations. So outside of this prime early access event or second prime day, we think these faster delivery speeds will drive higher conversion rates, which should go well for the company throughout the holiday season. John, some estimates out there in the street are suggesting Amazon from this day might pull in over $4 billion in sales. It might be another big day for them. Yet the stock continues to be under pressure. We're seeing it down here today. What is holding back Amazon stock at this point?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,5,2022-10-11 14:13:52
2994," Amazon from this day might pull in over $4 billion in sales. It might be another big day for them. Yet the stock continues to be under pressure. We're seeing it down here today. What is holding back Amazon stock at this point? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I think broadly, internet is kind of down today at varying levels. So, but to your point, remember in July, the July prime day event we estimated they generated about 7 billion in revenue. And that was about 5 billion incremental to what they would normally do during two days in July. So we think this will be a big event for the company over the next two days. And remember the July prime day event led to the strong 3Q guidance. And for the company for this year, they didn't have a second prime event right last year. So they're going to report earnings in a couple of weeks. They're going to have this effectively the second prime day for their 4Q guide. And we're looking for about 12% e-commerce growth in 4Q. And overall revenue, when they guide to it in a couple of weeks, we're looking, we're about a percent and a half above the street. So we are looking for pretty robust growth. And remember, Amazon despite the stock price today and thus far this year, there are a couple of good things going on. You have revenue growth re-excelerating, both in 3Q and in 4Q versus flat in the first half of the year. And they are pulling out of this massive historic investment cycle, which usually builds well for the stock. So we'll have to see, I know it's a chopping market and tougher internet. But there are good things going on fundamentally at the company. We're taking a look at some of the comparisons in terms of the stock performance, Amazon versus Walmart versus Target. You could easily throw best buy into the mix too if you wanted to. There's so many brands that have tried to take advantage as tertiary players or secondary options, I should say. When we do have a massive sales blitz like this ahead of the holiday season, but are all sales or promotional cycles created equal from your perspective? Oh yeah, you know, and I can't totally speak to what the other players are doing. You usually do see other players around typically around prime days doing things. And also, Amazon does a lot of things in the lead up to prime days. Like even I think small businesses like for the July event generated about 3 billion in revenue in the three week lead up to the July prime day. So, but I think, you know, kind of as we're talking about, I think this will kind of kick off the holiday season, not only for Amazon, but for other retailers. And we will see, like I was saying earlier, if it's going to be an earlier holiday season this year and where the consumer is, you know, just giving all these macro headlines. Cal and analyst John Blacklegge always great to get some time with you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Before I head to break, let's take a look at this Morgan Stanley downgrade on shares of Zoom. Analyst Meta Marshall says the team is stepping to the sidelines on Zoom as there are no near term catalyst for the stock. The online business isn't expected to stabilize until early next year. Suggesting an overhang is likely to stay over the next stock for the next six months. Marshall's price target on Zoom goes to $90 from $130. Zoom shares are down about 61% so far on the year.

2995," music Let's get down to business. Carvana, now rejecting Michigan's decision to suspend its vending machine like dealership due to violations of state laws calling its allegations, baseless and reckless. The Arizona-based Use Car Retailer says the state is looking to shut down a growing Michigan business over what amounts to a technical paperwork violation involving title and transfer issues. Now Carvana says it has corrected most paperwork issues and will address further concerns through consultation. In terms of PayPal, they plunged further this week after a weekend policy change suggested the financial service platform would deduct $2,500 from users spreading misinformation. That led to a delete PayPal movement resulting in a wave of cancellations. PayPal has since walked back the announcement saying that it was posted in error, shares of PYPL. They have been in decline as we have been tracking those in response to this policy and the retraction. And be real, the filter free social media company gaining popularity among Gen Z.

Still many of the apps, new installs, they're from young people in the US where Apple's iOS is the preferred platform. South? No filters. Interesting. Alright, gas prices are on the rise again here in the US after OPEC Plus slash its output target by 2 million barrels a day. Now President Biden is reevaluating the nation's relationship with Saudi Arabia. Y'all find it's your commas Rick Newman has the latest. Like interesting to see how this relationship has evolved and may continue to evolve. Yeah, Saudi Arabia not such an ally anymore, basically rebuffing Biden in his request to pump more oil. But when you hear that Biden is reevaluating the relationship with Saudi Arabia, it's hard to figure out what actually might change. And I don't think people should expect much to actually change at least not anytime soon, not before the midterm elections. But people are angry. I mean, just going around, I've found that I'm talking with friends and other people and they're like, what is wrong with OPEC? Why are they citing with Russia, basically, and trying to push up the price of oil, which is going to just give Russia more energy revenue to fight its war with Ukraine? I don't think that's exactly what's going on. But people are pissed off here in the United States and you're hearing some people in Congress say we got to do something about this. So not entirely clear what we can do. There are some ideas out there. My guess is not much is actually going to change. That's prices have come down, but they're still high, is that still top of mind amongst voters as we look to the midterms? Heck yeah. I mean, we figured out this year that consumer confidence-based-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,7,2022-10-11 14:23:16
2996," I'm down, but they're still high. Is that still top of mind amongst voters as we look to them in terms? Heck yeah. I mean, we figured out this year that consumer confidence basically goes up and down based on gas prices. Nothing seems to drive consumer confidence more than gas prices just because they're so visible. So where are gas prices right now? We're looking at about 392 today. Now oil prices, which are the main component of gas prices, did go up after OPEC said they were going to cut production. Remember, that was a long term production cut. It wasn't like anything changed in today's inventories. But then oil prices came back down. They did not go quite as high as some people thought. To figure out where gas prices are going, I look at wholesale gasoline prices. Anybody can do this on Yahoo Finance. The ticker symbol is RBOB. That's wholesale gasoline. And those prices have actually come down during the last few days. So we may see 392 come down to, I don't know, 385. I think if you're in the Biden White House and you're thinking about the midterm elections, you want most people to see a price that starts with a three rather than a four. And I think Biden might get that for the next three weeks. What's that lead gas sound for? Right. Really? I think it's on the black market. I might need it this year. Yeah, I think you're the only guy you might have a car that takes it. Let's take that off, library. The trend, yeah. We're doing it. You're the man. I'll talk to you. We'll talk to you soon.

2997," Let's get back to our very own Julie Hyman who is there with a special guest, Julie. Thanks so much, Zaz. With me is Ken Kenselli's president and CEO of Churchill Asset Management, which has an enormous credit portfolio. And so can give us a good read on what is going on in companies at this time of rising interest rates. Ken, thanks for being here. Thanks for joining us. So obviously we have been hearing about a lot of gloom lately, right? Some commentary from Jamie Dime yesterday, the IMF cutting its growth forecast for the next several years. What are you hearing from your portfolio companies? And are you guys sort of getting more stringent in some of your credit standards right now? Sure, no, great question. Great to see you here. Look, I think as we go through the challenging economic dynamic that we're seeing, obviously we are being more conservative about our lending standards and companies that we look to finance and invest in. But that being said, if you look at our portfolio today, we have about 41 billion in capital and management. We have about 400, actually 450 portfolio companies all across the US, all US, mid-sized businesses. And what we're seeing frankly is that, you know, those companies by and large are actually quite healthy and growing and actually performing quite well. So, you know, I understand there's a lot of doom and gloom in the air, but the reality is that if you're financing high-quality companies and businesses and being very careful about the businesses that you finance and invest in and you apply, you know, a very high standard, there are still some very fantastic businesses to finance and invest in, particularly ones that have benefited from COVID-19, you know, either through technology or logistics. And so, that's where we focus. We tend to focus on software, business services, healthcare, distribution, logistics businesses that have generally benefited from COVID. And so, today our portfolios in quite good shape. Deal flow remains in the middle market for the better companies, quite robust. I would say for the more challenged businesses, those companies are kind of off the market, if you will right now. They're not really being, you know, transacted. But I think for the better businesses, there are still opportunities to finance and we're certainly seeing that. Well, let me ask you then on the fringes, right? Because I think back to the financial crisis and going into it, things look much the same. And I'm not saying that this is the same. What I'm asking for about is are there signs on the fringes of things at higher risk levels that we should be watching? Yes. So, I would say certainly for the companies or deals that were done at levels that now would be considered excessive or kind of beyond reasonable businesses that frankly may have yielded slightly more in return. But obviously brought with that return a lot more risk. And so, I would say that you'll start to see cracks along those lines. Businesses, for example, that have real issues passing on price increases to their customers, right? So, as cost rise, can they actually roll those expenses back to their customers, whether those are retail or commercial? But I will say that the, you know, there is certainly an expectation that 23 is going to be a more challenging time as we move through this credit cycle. I continue to believe that it will be relatively short. I think that when I compare this, for example, to the GFC and we did manage capital through the GFC, that this is not the same as the GFC and a lot of the fundamental cracks that we saw in the GFC, particularly the mortgage market and some of the issues with the banks. We're just not seeing that today. So, will we be in for a modest recession? I think that's becoming increasingly clear. We will. The Fed seems intent on doing that regardless of the consequences, which I think is trying to be prudent relative to the inflation threat. But I think at the end of the day, we're not looking at a two-year downturn. We're looking at a shorter term impact. But it will impact those businesses that were, you know, maybe looked pretty attractive at the margin a year ago. Right. You know, gee, we're getting 10% for a senior secured loan. Well, there's a reason. No, not so much. So, I think that's, you know, that's the thing to look for. Um, Radella, I spoke earlier and he talked about America being in decline. And you, when it was your turn to speak, really pushed back against that notion and we are, you are what one would call a dream.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,9,2022-10-11 14:30:46
2998," You talked about America being in decline. And you, when it was your turn to speak, really pushed back against that notion. And you are what one would call a self-made man, right? And so why don't you think that America is in decline? Well, first of all, if you look at the reported competing dynamics, the competing cultures or competing models, I think about the American model. And I think that if you look at the challenges that we've seen over the last century, right? I think about a communist system or a socialist system. And I think I believe very strongly that the US is the place in the world that has been for centuries now where it provides economic opportunity, upward mobility. I'm a big believer in that. I'm on the board of Teach for America, Connecticut. And I think that we are still the best place to raise a family to build a business and to pursue your dream. So I'm fundamentally an optimist and I'm sticking to it. I like it. I like the optimism. Are we going to leave with our Ken Kensell of Churchill Cavill asset management? Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thanks so much, really excellent conversation there. Everyone's switching gears here. Want to get to our calls of the day here today. Our Alka Things Off NFLX. I'm looking at Netflix. JP Morgan's tape is that it's advertising. We'll bring in billions of dollars still making waves this morning. Now the bank retains a neutral rating with a $240 price target here. And there you're taking a look at shares. On the day, of course, there's a broader base sell off, especially in tech as we've been tracking. But NFLX shares down by about 5.8%. They had actually seen much of that kind of move higher be priced in, intraday yesterday. And so now it's a question of even with this kind of bullish perspective that they have, where some of the other bearish takes on the street are starting to pour in that as well. And you had actually mentioned one earlier today here. That particularly coming out and saying that Netflix shares have caught a relative bid post week, two Q resulting guidance and optimism. However, in the end, this is not rocket science. Their move to launch an ad supported alternative is this fraught with ARPU. ARPU, essentially, that average revenue per user, technological and financial product risk. That, I believe, had come out from, it was Jeff Rees earlier today. Pivotal. Pivotal. Was it? So all of that, you're starting to have a healthy bull bear dialogue on this. Yeah, it's going to be a fun earnings report from Netflix in a couple weeks, because you have all this optimism. Netflix shares up now about 15 or 16% in the three months on an ad service that doesn't even exist yet. And that's no revenue. And then, oh, yeah, you have to stay focused on what this company is going to report. And let me remind it folks, the past three quarters from Netflix have not been good. The sales have decelerated year over year for the past three quarters. Margins have been under pressure. People have become more mobile, have clicked out of Netflix, or flat out cancel it as prices have gone higher. So it's an interesting time, I think, to be involved with the Netflix story. The promise might be there, but again, near term, this is no longer the Netflix of old. It's just a matter of how many people, number one, opt into that ad tear. But then, additionally, the amount of advertising revenue that they actually realize from it going forward in the number of campaigns that make their way into Netflix versus a bundle, perhaps, that comes in the future, especially from a company in Disney that we know is also going to layer on some of their ad-supported ambitions as well here within this broader streaming landscape. All right, let's stay on tech here. I'm watching a good note, again, from Chris Daly, City Analysts, we frequently cite his work. I do at least, because I think he's really on the pulse of this really great chip slowdown of 2022. Calling out some weakness and cancellations of orders over analog devices, apparently that has been hitting their results, but now he's seeing that spread, especially in Europe, over at the likes of NXP semiconductor, and also Texas instruments. Now, Daly is just flat out calling this a downturn now hitting the analog chip space. Take this, you take weak results from AMD, you have that really disappointing quarter from Intel a couple months ago, and this could be a very, very challenging third quarter earnings season for chip players, not only because the results by themselves may not be good, but the guidance may be just absolutely brutal. Yeah, one of the only bright spots it seems at this point in time, at least for the broader chip segment is, or maybe two of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,10,2022-10-11 14:35:11
2999," Cells may not be good, but the guidance may be just absolutely brutal. Yeah, one of the only bright spots it seems at this point in time, at least for the broader chip segment is, or maybe two of them, and one of them is years out from now. And that is kind of a multi-year, multi-pronged approach in the number of places that are going to bring on capacity, whether that be geographically or whether that be companies that we're talking about. And the production once that begins to ramp up. So that's a long term. What just had a ton of investment over the course of the last two years, pull forward and demand it's the data center businesses for a lot of the companies, even that we've talked about, inciting some of the own near-term headwinds that they do have. And if you see at least some churn in the number of chips that are in those data centers and needing to upgrade those on a more regular basis, that's perhaps at least a catalyst for some stability, but then it's what's the growth potential going forward from there. And that's something that investors, I believe, are pricing in and has been rattled to. A great extent at this point. Guys, coming up, investing in farmland. Yes, we're going to go to the heartlands and the farmlands. We're going to speak with the CEO of Acre Trader on the other side of this real quick. Get the overalls ready. Inside 40 A software landing for investors as market sentiment moves to real estate and even investments in farmland, acre trade wants to provide a marketplace for analysis and insight on the land itself, helping buyers maximize their purchase decisions now through an online platform. acre trade CEO, Carter Maloy, joins us now. Carter, great to have you here with us in studio. Thanks. So, walk us through the model, the platform and how quickly someone could go from evaluating the land to investing in it as well. In a matter of minutes, to the second part there, so very quickly our team is really there to help them with evaluations. So we're about 150 people in total.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,11,2022-10-11 14:39:41
3000," To investing in it as well. In a matter of minutes, to the second part there, so very quickly, our team is really there to help them with evaluations. So we're about 150 people in total. Good portion of that is software engineers and data scientists supporting a lot of the decisioning. But ultimately, how it works is very simple. We're a platform for investors to gain access to farmland. Farmland has performed incredibly well historically. We haven't heard much about it because frankly you had to go out and plop down a million dollars and manage a farm. It's just not a thing most people could do. So that's where our platform acre trader comes in. We really help the individual come on and rather than investing in a million dollars, you can put in $10,000 in on a slice of a farm. What is that? What would that $10,000? If I had $10,000 right now, what would that get me? And how do I analyze if that's a good investment? Yes, so it can get you anywhere from an acre to only a portion of an acre depending on where you are within the US or Australia, where we primarily invest. Ultimately, the quality of that investment, each investment we put on the website has full detail describing, here's why we believe this is an interesting investment. And here are the cons to each one of those as well with everything there. What are the best farms? What should I invest? How do I identify a good farm? Most of the institutional portfolios seem to be about 60% row crops, so things like corn and soybeans, and then 40% permanent crops, things that grow in trees, almonds, fruits, etc. What if I say I want to invest in wine land or kind of the vineyard country, if you will, is that expansion into kind of new states, new countries even where there are different types of either things being grown for regular produce or other types of products? How have you managed some of the demand or where customers are asking for that? We do get a lot of customers that equate what's on their kitchen table to quality, if this makes wine it must be a good investment, and then of course when they come learn a little more about that, it's like, actually I think I want to own the boring corn, maybe this wine is not for me. Okay, Calcan Drink Wine rather. So it's more about what the stock is that you can actually get into some of the other parts of the broader operation in a farm land as well. So it returns your generated two ways for that investor. One is through the cash incomes, you're getting a revenue share alongside the farmer, who's your partner in the deal, or a cash lease. But actually more importantly is you're getting exposure to potential appreciation of that land underneath you. So whereas the coupon may be something similar to a money market today, that money market does not protect you from inflation. In fact it exposes you to inflation, whereas with farm land there's an intense correlation to inflation historically. And so you're actually having you can achieve some protection from inflation by the underlying appreciation of that land. That is interesting stuff. Well, I have to go now scrunch up maybe $10,000. So I think I'll try to make sure that you're not going to get the money. So I think that's why acre trader CEO, good to see you again. Appreciate it. Appreciate you guys.

3001," Okay The luxury brand Golden Goose is doubling down on its top supplier. Golden Goose CEO Silvio Compower joins us now alongside Yao Fines' brook, Silvio. Good to see you here. Help us understand the infatuation with your brand. What drives that? First of all, thank you so much for being here for a former small company from Venice. It's a big achievement. I was trying to explain the magic behind our special story. This is probably part of the magic. In the miracle that you were talking about people to see that magic is needed to be able to put in our product. Then the people perceive something special because for people who are always special today is not about how much or how much has been seen as a product. And speaking of that, a lot of consumers. Right now you're in LA for a Golden Goose event. You're going to have content creators there. We've seen the likes of Taylor Swift and Reese Witherspoon wear Golden Goose sneakers. How important has it been for influencers like those to wear your brand and ultimately drive to your success? It's a great question and I have a simple answer. Because magical is that we never place this product to be celebrities because Golden Goose is made in order to make everyone feel special. So the fact that every shoe is made, every shoe is unique. Is making our customer become a lover. And the fact that this celebrity has been wearing these has been just a great amplifier to a message that is simple and is not limited just for a small community. Why is it really open to a wider community? What are we seeing in the style trends right now? I mean, for Kanye West and Gap, it's been about some of the kind of more, I won't say basic or kind of dirty looks out there, but there is something that's out there to like making things look lived in already even before they sell. What is it with the trends right now that you're saying, how much do you expect to kind of be able to lean further into that and where the customer is actually continuing to take price despite, hey, looks like a shoe has a scuff on it. What's up with that? Thank you, Brian, for this question. This is technically the first time that I'm answering to this question live to someone. And it has been quite a question for a couple of years because you should remember that Golden Goose has been the first brand ever to be stressed first, Nekers. And at the beginning, people were a little bit like skeptic, oh, why do I have to spend 500 bucks for the issue? While it was part of the magic again, Golden Goose never wanted to promote the product of now. We always want to know the people to talk about our product. So there was a space of an undefined space where the people were not really getting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,13,2022-10-11 14:48:20
3002," So there was a space of an undefined space where the people were not really getting about that, but the reality is that simply what we try to do is to inject in life to our products to unleash the sense of uniqueness of every product we offer to our communities. And it's a little bit like you know your old device. It is always the most special because you're really taking with it your memories. So every item that keep with you and keep with it you know his memories is then more special than something just because he's more extensive you know. So there's a new notion of going from product to purpose, product to values rather than just the product. So this is what is going on right now in the industry and I think the example of Kanye is very interesting quite far from Golden Goose because Kanye is still you know quite fashion focused why Golden Goose is consumer obsessed. So this position Golden Goose in a very special angle of the industry. And speaking of just the long term goal of Golden Goose you've been in this industry since 2000 you've been through three different investment groups here, latest premier took a majority stake in Golden Goose. So I have to ask here there are also the owners of Doc Mardin's Valentino. Could we see Golden Goose go public in the near future? I mean it's part of course you know of the options and the most important to us where we may focus our two things first creating value every day to our consumers second to stay flexible because the market outside is very complicated and very complex and as again imagine you know consumers is really one of the first angles that the market and these difficulties and opportunities came with your reflected on. So it is very important in this process of education to stay flexible. Now that's extremely important to bring up especially in this conversation and especially in this timing right now given your kind of consumer base that you go after the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the Golden Goose product if you will even with some of the anticipated recessionary concerns that many consumers have are you seeing that show up in any of the sales figures and any of the relationship with that consumer right now? It's a great question so as you can imagine for sure you know that almost 42 44% of our businesses are driven by America's and so you know I have a really special angle to be in the Italian brand because no really many Italian brands have the lucky that Golden Goose is and I can tell you that on the American from the American point of view we didn't see any recession last year we achieved something around 78% plus versus 2020 and this year we are in a zone of plus 40 versus next year versus last year in America and in general the company the first semester has been performing like in creative but you know like last year why? Because again we don't really look at the trend in fashion we really look in trend in consumer and there's something that is for sure the KPIs that consumers look at are not a BDA or no cash conversion is no revenues but are really like MPS customer acquisition is really the ability that the company and the brand has to retain and compensate with these communities so this is where Golden Goose is really representing an excellence and I really think that we are really representing a kind of new frontier for the consumer industry on this side. Really fascinating I've seen so many of your products on some of the high-end kind of fashion retailers and resellers out there as well and so I'm excited to see where the brand goes from here Golden Goose CEO Sylvia Kampar joining us here today thanks so much for the time as well as Yahoo finances own Brooke DiPalma who's going to stick around for us here because we've got much more as President Biden has proposed a new rule that will make it more likely for millions of gig economy workers to be classified as employees Uber and Lyft and DoorDash all trading lower on this news Yahoo finances Brooke DiPalma sticking around with us for this conversation Brooke. That's right so this new labor law will allow protection of workers basic rights make it easier for employers to properly classify their workers and also protect independence and businesses",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,14,2022-10-11 14:52:20
3003," That's right. So this new labor law will allow protection of workers basic rights, make it easier for employers to properly classify their workers, and also protect independent businesses that follow the law. Of course, that's out from the U.S. Department of Labor this morning. Companies now expected to provide certain benefits to full-time employees and not to contractors. Of course, that includes minimum wage over time, apportionals of workers, social security, taxes, and contributions to unemployment insurance. Here in a tweet from U.S. Secretary, he says that misclassification hurts workers by denying them important benefits and basic rights like them in a minimum wage over time pay. It's a problem we often see in low-wage jobs. Enforcing the rights of misclassified workers is a priority because these workers have so much stake. Of course, this comes on the heels of the Supreme Court overturning Grovy Wade in earlier this summer. And it also comes after 25 Democratic members of Congress led by Elizabeth Warren, Representative Bush, Accord Bush-Adish and Missouri, sent letters to CEO of Amazon, lived, DoorDash, and Grub. To question a policy, that was a Trump error decision. Now, of course, Wall Street reacting to this shares lower on Uber, lived at DoorDash, Dan Ives, a show favorite here calling this a clear blow to the gig economy and a near term concern for the likes of Uber, and let's you also add it. That depending upon this model, you could really overturn the likes of DoorDash, like Uber, of course, these customers or employees rather coming in doing their job here and there and then going, not right now, getting the full benefits of an employee. So lots more fallout to come from this decision. And once again, this is the second attempt of the Biden administration to overturn this. Yeah, and you see these harsh reactions, notably with Lyft there. It's now this issue that has long plagued this industry as well, but this comes at a time as these companies finally start to achieve a little bit of profits. If this changes, if this goes against them, and immediately goes them, brings them back to losing large sums of money. At a time where as well, some of the prices that they had passed on in search charges for gas as well, to consumers, where that had started to, at least on the gas price front, started to come down in terms of the release of the stock. In terms of the relation to the highest peaks that we had seen on an all time basis earlier this year. And so those surcharges finally starting to come down, but yet this could also factor into the higher elevated prices, consumers are seeing on the economy front too. So we're going to be watching this very closely. Y'all find this is on Brook to Palm, breaking this down for us. Thanks, Brook. And everyone coming up, Duncan, in some hot water over its rewards program, we've got the deep snacks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,15,2022-10-11 14:57:04
3004," Welcome back everyone. It's time for Cut for Time. We've got two stories today, one minute only clock for each. We start with this. Dunkin'. Dunkin' is facing some backlash about its new rewards program. My goodness, the coffee giant announced a new program for customers, axing the free birthday drink and changing their point system, causing resentment from loyal customers like Brian Sausie. I'm upset, Brad. I'm upset. So I noticed my app changed over the weekend and it's going to take me, I calculated $90. I'm going to spend $9 to get a free coffee from Dunkin'. Right now I have 345 points which gets me two espresso shots. But ultimately don't take away my birthday drink. This is a tradition that Starbucks had. Dunkin' adopted. I need my free birthday drink. It's a right-of-pass that I spend enough money at these places. I want to be rewarded. I mean, even Nike still sends me updates. Every other brand that I buy with, I'm pretty sure Chipotle, Nike, all of these companies don't give me that little update and say, hey, here's 20% off. Just because it's your birthday. And you're involved in all of these kind of reward systems so that you do get the birthday reward. $90. And coffee to get something free. It just don't seem right. All right, staying on food, Chipotle in focus after Bernstein initiated coverage with an outperform rating saying the chain's customer strategy through apps like TikTok will prove to be a positive thing for shareholders. And I was checking out this Chipotle presence on TikTok. It is pretty, pretty darn impressive. 1.3. I think almost actually two million followers on TikTok. Some of the posts are great. But again, this fits, I think, very much with the Chipotle brand, which has always been focused on driving sales and engagement via social media. Now that you've taken that DNA of this brand and brought it to TikTok. Yeah, the Guacomole attachment rate is strong with this one here today, as we're tracking shares. It's like the grill replacement, right? Well, I mean, I don't know. The grill replacement rate could be stronger if some of those grills start to crap out at Chipotle. So ultimately here, for Chipotle, what they have been able to do so well is, and yes, we're going to say it, menu innovation. Case O goes a far away when you're talking about burritos and changing out pollo assado and just having new types of meat offerings that you're able to throw onto the different bowls, the burritos, the tacos. I mean, the burrito was like 11 bucks when I was in college now. I would do whatever I want to do. 15. All right, one programming note. So our all market summit is Monday, October 17th featuring guests, including CEOs from Target, Microsoft and General Motors. Of course, we also speak to Chipotle CEO, Brian Nichol. I am very jazzed up about that one. All right, coming up in the next hour, Okiko Fujita will speak with IMF's chief economist on their latest economic report. They said this morning that the worst is yet to come. I can't wait to see that conversation with the Kiko. Don't worry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,16,2022-10-11 15:02:05
3005," makes your mind feel comfortable. was expansion. mouse. Welcome to Yahoo Finance live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what we're watching this morning. Taking a look at where stocks are trading right now. The Dow, the only one in the green right now, up about 43 points, the SMP 500 and the Nasdaq both in the red. All of this ahead of key inflation data and earnings, the Nasdaq by the way, we saw falling deeper into the red after hitting a two year low. Moving ahead here, Stormy Waters ahead, the IMF downgrade that's growth outlook for the global economy as a fund warns of a harsh worldwide recession. Chief Economist Pierre Olivier Greenchess is going to be joining us to break down the latest report later this hour. And doubling down on climate financing, the US commits $950 million to accelerate the development of clean technology. We're going to talk to a senior specialist at the Climate Investment Fund to see how the group is planning to deploy all of that capital. As always, we are beginning with a market check. 90 minutes in to the trading day right now. As we pointed out, the Dow, the only one in the green right now and taking a look at where bond yields have been trading. We saw the 10 year start to move closer to that 4% level earlier today and now we are seeing it at 3.9, the 30 year yield at 3.9 and the 5 year at 4%. We're beginning today though with a focus on the semiconductor sector today. Here's an interesting number to point out. $240 billion wiped out from the global chip sector. Global market value, we should say since the close on Thursday and we're talking about it of course because of those expert controls the US has now put in and that really has had global implications. We are continuing to see a sell off in US chip stocks. You see in video down 2.5% Qualcomm seeing the biggest losses there down about 4.7% all this of course as investors try to calculate their exposure to the Chinese market. A lot of this spilling over from what we saw over in the Asia session particularly over in South Korea and Japan. A bit of a catch up session there because they did have the Monday holiday off but take a look at where those stocks chip makers ended up. We're talking about Reneces which is a chip maker. Semi conductor equipment maker, Tokyo Electron also down and significantly over in South Korea. We did see Samsung and SK Heinigs the biggest chip makers out there also down significantly and then worth noting what we saw over with TSMC of course the largest chip maker globally down significantly. We're talking about 7% right now. By the way the sell off was so significant what we saw there and also as so many of these countries and companies try to figure out the global implications we have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,17,2022-10-11 15:06:25
3006," Right now, by the way, the the sell off was so significant what we saw there and also as so many of these countries and companies try to figure out the global implications. We have seen a move in currency currencies as well. The Korean one down there about four tenths of a percent. So we're here to break it all down for you this morning with Dan Halley, our very own chip expert here at Yahoo Finance and Dan, you know, I just ran through so many different stocks we've been tracking over in Asia here in the U.S. by the way we also didn't talk about ASMR over in Europe. But what are how are you making sense of these latest expert controls that have been put in place that really came down on Friday but there's still a lot the market is still processing right now. Yeah, you know, you talk about those the companies that are overseas that had the holiday SK Heinrich Samsung TSMC. You can see them kind of just dropping off as they kind of get back into things. But then you look at the lights of, you know, let's say in video or Intel Qualcomm. They're all still being hit. You could see that came in on Monday and you know, you can look at stuff like applied materials, lamb research, KLA corp. These are all companies that also took a hit. Those companies are about the manufacturing side of things. So I think that's something that's important to look at. It's the manufacturing aspect as well as the overall technology. So applied materials, lamb research, KLA, they're talking about wafer manufacturing. Those are a problem there. And it'll be continued to be a problem because those companies are providing the capabilities to companies in China to actually build the chips that they need. Then you look at the chip companies like SNK Heinrichs, like Samsung, like TSMC that have actual factories out there in China. So they're all getting hit. And I think that you're going to continue to see this. Then obviously some American companies as well when it comes to the AI side of things. In video, I've taken a hit a while back when there was discussion of more export controls going into effect. And they said that they were working with the Biden administration to try to figure out what they can do there. But obviously we're seeing them taking some damage now as well. Yeah. And we're sort of backing up to say, well, what exactly the ruling was in case people are just sort of catching up right now. Number one, this new ruling means it would live in chip makers from semiconductors made with US technology. We're talking about the most advanced AI super computers. Also, those US citizens would not be allowed to be a part of that which is why it will be out. Which is certainly key. And then of course you wouldn't be able to use US equipment to manufacture these chips. And that's the thing that we often forget. So many of these companies, you've got global names out there. But many of them still use US equipment. If you are one of those, you would not be able to export to China. Yeah. I think that's the big thing that kind of gets lost is that the US is still the leader dominates the space when it comes to building actual chips. The companies that build chips or provide the materials to build chips. Those are largely US companies. So if you take that out of the equation, it's a huge blow to China. It's a huge blow to these companies. Obviously, the discussion here is about whether or not the technologies will be fed into the Chinese military. And that's the big catch there. It's the same thing that we've been talking about for some time when it comes technology in China. And we saw this during the Trump administration obviously seeing it during the Biden administration. But it'll continue to roll out and we just have to see how the other chip companies start to kind of process this or, you know, if they can get some exceptions. And we're noting really quickly that this isn't just about the regulation because this all comes at a time when we have seen a slowdown, whether it's demand in PCs, demanded other consumer electronics. That's another head when working against some of these chip makers, which is why we're seeing the pullback. Yeah, Gartner recently released yesterday released their latest note saying that worldwide PC shipments declined 19.5% in the third quarter. That's the worst decline in two decades worth pointing out, by the way, that it doesn't mean that the PC market is just, you know, going away. It's that we saw such explosive growth. And now it's coming back to, you know, buy a computer every year. That's crazy. I mean, unless, you know, you're like me. But, you know, this is going to be an issue, I think, for, you know, at least three years before we start to see PC sales start to pick up again. Okay. Thank you very much for the information. So, I'm just getting this nameless system that you want to simply check it out. And that's the latest creative input. Another update is the voribi folder battery. Okay. Please go to flip merciless lottery and continue to link to arrive as soon as",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,19,2022-10-11 15:13:34
3007, you know at least three years before we start to see PC sales start to pick up again. Okay just another narrative to add to the global tech space there. Thanks so much for that Dan. Let's turn out to a look at the broader markets as investors gear up for result season. We have joining us now. SEMA Shah principal asset management chief. Global strategy. SEMA's here with us in studio today. It's good to talk to you today. It feels like we're finally kind of able to pivot a little if you will. Looking at earning season with the big banks reporting later this week but what do you have your eye on in terms of what's driving the market right now. So we continue to think of course about the Federal Reserve and what's going on there increasingly we're getting a lot of questions about the dollar. How is that going to impact the rest of the world and even could that influence Fed policy going forward which I should say we think that the Fed stays very much domestically focused. With regards to earning season the thing that we have seen is this year top-line earnings growth has been incredibly strong. It has much to beat expectations time and time again but we're getting towards the end of the year when you are expecting to see economic weakness not to see pin but it probably won't start to show through until early 2023 so this could be another solid quarter. Yeah in terms of the narratives we're expecting during earnings season obviously a lot of sort of similarities in terms of threads. FX had wins a key one that we've been watching also just where the consumer demand is right now. What are your biggest concerns. Well I think the FX had one is an important one you are seeing their companies which have a lot of international exposure. So those which are exposed to Europe of course China emerging markets they're struggling because their economies are also slowing a lot quicker. Throw on top of that the strong dollar policy or sorry the strong dollar outlook and of course these companies are being additionally challenged so their margins are being compressed further and further. So that's one thing they're watching but also the consumer resilience is really interesting and I think that what we're expecting to see is unless until you see US labor market weakness really start to get going actually the consumer could stay quite resilient we know that there's a headwind coming but it's not quite here yet. We're still a few weeks out from the next FOMC meeting we had a New York Fed survey come out today pointing to inflation expectations declining in the short term but increasing in the medium and long term. We've got the CPI print coming out later this week but what is your read on where we are when it comes to inflation? We have still very very far to go you know we think we're hoping that we have seen peak inflation the energy prices is still very much a wild card we assume that they're going to keep coming down but as we've seen over the last week that's definitely not a guarantee. Now even if that peak is behind us it's not enough really because we do think that the decline from here is going to be extremely slow. We can see that core commodities core transportation those segments of inflation probably will turn deflationary but it's the stuff like shelter inflation medical services those parts which are very very sticky and once they start to get going it's very difficult to contain them unless you can create economic weakness. So from the Federal Reserve's perspective they almost have to engineer a hard landing in order to contain inflation so that means bringing rates up further keeping them high for pretty long so high for longer and only at that point can then we start to see some kind of relief on the inflation side. You said they have to engineer a hard landing some still holding out hope that it won't be quite as severe but it sounds like you think that's a necessary step to get inflation back to where the central bank needs it. Exactly I think a soft landing wouldn't be sufficient. I mean what the Fed needs to do is create labor market slack increase labor supply almost make things so difficult that households people have to return to the labor market and by doing that you reduce wage pressures but in so doing of course you make the economy economic conditions extremely challenging but this is your kind of your price reset this is your only way you're bringing down inflation has the pace of the rate high expense sufficient for you I mean there's something that would argue that it's going too quickly yes they need to hike rates to get the labor market in check but more importantly inflation as a whole in check are they moving too quickly? I would say that they start to very slowly I mean the fact that they started off with a 25 basis point hike in retrospect seems a little bit crazy but at this stage I think they do need to be move very quickly but they do of course risk the fact that you know given the lag from monetary policy to actually hitting real economy you do risk and even deeper slow down than what they necessarily need to achieve so it probably it could be slow down but of course you know when you have an inflation problem this serious it's important to get in front of it and really front load your what they're doing is quite moving forward but our will speak significantly,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,19,2022-10-11 15:15:34
3008," It's really neat to achieve. So it probably could be slowed down, but of course, when you have an inflation problem, this serious, it's important to get in front of it and really front load your rate hikes in order to make sure that the inflation problem just doesn't continue to grow. Really quickly, a lot of people looking at their portfolios right now saying, well, what do I do in this environment? In terms of how much cash you set aside, has that calculation shifted as a result of the volatility that we've seen? It's interesting actually, because one of the, I've been traveling around the years of the last week and the question we keep getting from clients is actually, when are we going to be ready to put our money to work? Right, so everyone's starting to look already to, when does the market reach its floor? And where do we go from there? So from that perspective, it's really important to have that kind of liquidity in your portfolio. So you're ready to deploy it as soon as those opportunities arise. So there is a concern about volatility. So in the run-up, it means about playing defense, going high qualities. We do like long end treasuries, even secure ties, debts, which have a better relationship within economic conditions and what you see with investment grade credit or even high yield credit. But really, the opportunity set, which is the best, is still real assets. This is a high inflation, low growth environment, real assets can continue to perform well at that point. A lot of people taking notes, right? There are similar principle asset management, chief global strategist, thanks so much for joining us today. Well, bearish outlook on matters weighing on the company's shares. Today, we have seen a pullback in that stock after Atlantic equities downgraded it from overweight to neutral. And you see that stock now down more than 3%. Analyst James Corwell's citing increasing competition for online ad dollars and a challenging macro environment as key headwinds for earnings growth. This comes as Meta Kixoff, its developer conference, Meta Connect today. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to unveil the firm's latest mixed reality headset that begins at 1 p.m. Eastern. Coming up, building a buffer. Are we going to start discussing crypto firms for tier one capital ratios? A new report from a global regulator suggests it might need to set aside capital just like banks with our crypto next. Let's see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,20,2022-10-11 15:19:24
3009," I'm in the car! Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Let's check in on where the price of Bitcoin is moving right now. Stobal of that $20,000 handle down about 1% this morning. Earlier today, our team spoke with Galaxy Digital Founder CEO Mike Novigratz. He had to say this about what Fed tightening means for the crypto space. Take a listen. It's hard to predict when these crypto winners, how long they go. You know, we're a couple years from a having cycle. I do think the Fed flinching creates some enthusiasm around Bitcoin as a store of value, Bitcoin as a recession as an inflation hedge as a hard money when the rest of the world keeps printing money. Joining us to break down some of those comments. We've got our very own David, the holler David, you're part of that conversation. Interesting that he said the Fed flinching could mean that crypto would be a little more attractive because that sort of was not the correlation just a month ago when we were talking about where how far crypto had fallen. Right. At Kika. That's a great point in Novigratz is obviously all seasons crypto bull. But to his point, the correlation changes between crypto currencies and stocks has been sort of interesting for the past two weeks. Sometimes this correlation breaks down and it just comes back immediately when there's a large Fed event or CPI or something like that. Obviously, there's no Fed rate hike in October. So that might be one reason why we're seeing sort of a breakdown. But to his point, you know, analysts I've spoken with have also suggested maybe reasons for why crypto might be holding up slightly better, at least since July. The stock market has a lot to do with how much it is sold off in the previous quarter, the second quarter. So that's an explanation of that. But I mean, a great example to point to is actually Coinbase's own stock compared to the NASDAQ today. Coinbase has had some news with Google. It's partnering with Google and it's going to use Google's cloud services. And in return, Google Cloud customers can pay with cryptocurrencies. And the parallel between the NASDAQ composite, not necessarily year to date, but over the last days, sort of, you know, running in parallel to each other. So, you know, I think that there are a crypto is sort of getting a little bit without so much macro data happening, at least yet this week. It's getting a little bit of its own kind of innovation narrative, which is coming back. Yeah, a big pop for Coinbase right there on the back of that news that stock up more than 4%. David Hollereth is always thanks so much for that. Well, a setback for the Biden administration as a union representing 12,000 rail world workers voted against the possible contract agreement between freight rail companies and the 12 unions raising concerns once again of a possible nationwide strike. Yeah, who finances Danny Romero and Rick Newman. But the one with me here at the desk today, Danny, let's start with you because you have been speaking to the unions directly. What's the very latest on where these talks stand? Yeah. So I spoke with Peter Kennedy. He is the chief negotiator and strategist. And he says that the main reason why the union did not ratify this this tentative deal goes back to the lack of paid sick time. So there is a supplemental sick leave plan that is on the table. But that doesn't include, for example, if you if your child gets sick and you need to take that day off, it's it doesn't it doesn't include in that. So again, there's a discrepancy between what the union wants and needs and what the presidential emergency board had put forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,21,2022-10-11 15:23:08
3010," It doesn't, it doesn't include in that. So again, there's a discrepancy between what the union wants and needs and what the presidential emergency board had put forward, recommended for this deal. So, and in that deal, sorry, excuse me, it included a 24% wage increase and also $5,000 bonus and an additional paid sick day. But from what the union has been telling me is that they're going to schedule more discussions with the railroad carriers and and waft, I mean, they'll have to wait and see, but it's seven more unions are expected to vote from now until November 20th. Rick, I'm thinking back to when the White House stepped in and it was sort of crisis averted. You get the sense, you know, are we at here we go again? I don't think so. So crisis averted until the midterm elections, politically speaking, if this gets, if this goes into has to be resolved after the midterm, just not a political crisis. Anymore. And everything Danny just said, I mean, this sounds like small potatoes, honestly, based on all the concessions they've gotten so far, they've gotten a nice pay increase, better working conditions. So this sounds bridgeable, honestly, but I guess we might, you know, in terms of the political conversation, we might hear Republicans saying, oh, President Biden failed to get this deal done. We could have higher prices because, you know, a strike would drive up the cost of everything that gets shipped by rail, which is a lot of stuff, but it's not going to happen before the midterm. So it's just really not a political story anymore. I don't think. Yeah, so much of this has framed in the context of the midterms or what, less than a month out. Danny, what's the sense right now in terms of the hard line that exists on these key sticking points, you just pointed out how long is this like the drag out now? Well, like I said, there are scheduling more discussions with the railroad carriers, but the railroad carriers actually responded when the union rejected this tentative deal. They said that they were disappointed, but this morning the union fired back and we actually have a sound bite. So just take a listen to what they had to say this morning. Frankly, we're disappointed that the railroads were not willing to engage in discussions that would have resulted in paid sick days, front members. So, you know, it's, it, the path goes both ways on this, you know. So if the parties don't come to terms, then there could be a strike, but that strike wouldn't happen until mid-Nobember, five days after Congress goes back to session. Okay. Just what the administration wants to hear, right? I predict it's going to get settled. I predict there will be no strike. Okay, well, I'll be watching Rick and Danny. Thanks so much for that. Coming up on the other side, two and a half trillion dollars in buying power, we discussed the reach of the Hispanic consumer and why addressing this key demographic should be a business priority.

3011," Dieser hena Frenzy Li-tant Laugh Nabi Chitt Chitt Die Dooms vegetables Hooray Bom�umm Pitch What is the final week of Hispanic Heritage Month? And we're taking a look today at investing in the Latinx community. The fast growing group accounts for 19 percent of all Americans, making it the nation's second largest racial group and a major opportunity for institutions. Joining us to discuss this, Joseon Fernandez, he's been recognized by Crenz, New York, as a notable leader in the Hispanic community. He's currently aerial investments head of national accounts. Joseon is good to talk to you today. You know, we've seen those numbers in terms of the demographic makeup of this community. How should we be thinking about them in terms of investing power and buying power? Yeah, thank you, Akiko. It's great to be on. One of the biggest growth engines and arguably the biggest opportunity, as you alluded to, lies in our US Latino cohort. The LDC, the Latino donors, collaborative have analyzed the impact of the Latino demographic and have found that it's responsible for $2.8 trillion in GDP. So $2.8 trillion in GDP, that's up $1 trillion and less than 10 years. So to put that into perspective for your viewers, if the US Latino cohort with its own independent country be the fifth largest economy in the world, surpassing that of the United Kingdom, surpassing that of France, surpassing that of India, Canada, Korea, the list goes on. And so the kicker here, Akiko, is that it's in our own respective borders, right? The fifth largest economy within our respective borders, it's an incredibly powerful demographic for both institutions and investors to be a part of. Yeah, with that said, it's not something that we always sort of frame the conversation around when we talk about the Latinx community. Why do you think that's the case? You know, I think ultimately organizations really need to pinpoint and say to themselves, okay, how important is diversity, right, within our respective organizations and diversity of thought, right? And can we actually, you know, invest in this particular space to grow the market, right? At the end of the day, we know very keenly at this junction that investing in diverse managers, investing in diverse perspectives is, is, is, can lead to, to outperformance, right? And there's certainly value there. And institutions certainly have a role to play here. They can invest in emerging managers, whether it be on the public side, whether it be on the private side, on the private side, you've seen venture capital firms really start to grow within the emerging manager section, as well as private equity and private credit. And so there's, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity, quite frankly, I think organizations need to really hone in and ultimately say to themselves, this is important to us. And we see the growth and we're going to invest in that growth. Yeah, in an aerial investment, how are you, you know, in your role trying to amplify some of that message? Well, you know, we, at aerial investments, we, we invest in the world that we want to see, right? Aerial investments is the first African-American owned asset management firm in the country, right? And so diversity is literally and figuratively in our DNA. We're committed to DE and I across all of our organization and we take very special care and are very purposeful in attracting diverse talent. And frankly, we don't just talk to talk, we, we certainly walk the walk. And our employees are 75% diverse when you look at leadership ranks, which tends to, to quite frankly be underrepresented a lot of organizations, we're at 67%. And most importantly, the minority ownership with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,23,2022-10-11 15:31:50
3012," when you look at leadership ranks, which tends to quite frankly be underrepresented a lot of organizations, we're at 67%. And most importantly, the minority ownership within organizations at 83%. So our COCEO, Melody Hobson, is a very firm proponent of what gets measured gets done. And we're immensely proud of those numbers. OK, well, continue to follow all the progress there. Aerial investments, head of national accounts, Hosanna Fernandez, good to talk to you today. Thank you. Well, coming up, the worst is yet to come. That's the dire warning from the IMF's chief economist as the fund downgrades its global growth outlook. It says inflation will peak this year, but isn't going away fast. He'll join us on the other side. Well, we will end the walk down更 soon....... Well, the IMF has downgraded its global economic growth outlook to 2.7 percent next year with growth in the U.S. scene at just 1 percent in 2023. The fund's new global outlook sees more than a third of the world economy contracting this coming year. With the European Union in China also continuing to stall. On inflation, the fund sees price rises peaking late this year but remaining at elevated levels. Joining us to discuss the report is Pierre Olivier Grinchas, the IMF's chief economist, who also got Yahoo Finance's Gen Chamburger joining in on the conversation. Pierre, it's good to talk to you today. You know, I'm thinking about these so-called stormy waters you've described in the report, whether it's the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis, what's happening in China. These have all been headwinds that you've been watching throughout the year. To what extent have they accelerated in the second half of the year that leads you to this downgrade? Well, it's certainly the case that some of the risks that we had flagged in earlier projection rounds, particularly in July, but even if you go back to April.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,24,2022-10-11 15:36:09
3013," to the Stagg Great? Well, it's certainly the case that some of the risks that we had flagged in earlier projection rounds, particularly in July, but even if you go back to April, have started to materialize. I mean, the energy crisis that results from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is perhaps the clearest one where we see this incredible toll that's taking on European economies right now. And also the fight against inflation that is proving quite challenging. The inflation keeps going up still. I mean, we're expecting that it's going to peak soon and then start going down as a result in part of actions by central banks, but it's proven both more persistent, more elevated, and also broader. It's not just energy prices that are going up. It's what we call core inflation that excludes energy and food prices. It's also pushing upwards. And so that's something that complicates the task for central banks around the world. The final factor in our forecast is, of course, to slow down in China. That is maybe there is a little bit less of a downward revision there. I mean, that's something that we saw a sharp slowdown in the second quarter of the year. And going forward, zero-covid policy is certainly leading to some localized lockdowns and confinements are affecting activity and the weakness in the property sector is also another factor. Here, Jennifer Seanberger here, it's great to see you. It seems like the global economy is really being stretched here. Perhaps on a string, you mentioned that a third of the countries will contract in growth this year or next. We've got the war in Ukraine. We've got interest rates going up globally. You mentioned the slowdown in China. We just saw the services sector contract in September for the first time in four months. So it just seems that it's not going to take much to push it over the edge. What do you see as the odds of the global economy tipping into recession next year? Well, we certainly flag a number of downside risks in our report. Some of them you mentioned, I mean, the fight against inflation could prove more difficult than we expected this point. We could have more energy-priced shocks. Markets could certainly experience a lot of stress. And associated with that in parts of the world, the strength of the dollar is an important factor. So we try to put all of this in an assessment of the risks around our baseline. And what we found out is that there is about a 25% probability that growth in 2023, global growth, could be at about 2%. And 2% is a very low number. We only had that about five times since 1970 and every time we had this, if you look, it's 1973, the oil price shock, 1981, and the fall curve disinflation, the 2008 financial crisis, all of them are sort of they are stuck in our collective memory as times of difficulties. And there's a 10 to 15% chance that actually output growth could be even lower than 1%. Now 1% is an interesting marker because this is at the level at which global output would remain stagnant per capita. And so that would be an economy that is not growing at all globally. Up here, you mentioned the strength of the dollar, a big concern, something we've been watching. I mean, what we're seeing are major economy currencies here, whether that is the yen, the euro, the sterling, see huge swings on the back of the dollar strength, but it's the EMs that get hit even harder, given the dollar's denominator, debt. How are you looking at that risk being elevated even further, given that it doesn't look like the dollar is going to pull back anytime soon? Yes, there's been a lot of strength in the dollar. Actually, what's interesting there also to point out is the strength of the dollar has been particularly important against other advanced economies. So the Japanese yen or the euro or the sterling. So more so than against many emerging market economies. In fact, even some emerging market economies, if you look at Brazil or Mexico or Peru, their currencies are appreciated against the US dollars. So it's more against advanced economies and emerging market economies. But in part, this is also because appreciation of the dollar is very painful in emerging market economies. So a number of them had already started tightening monetary policy, raising their policy rates, starting course if you want for their own economies and found themselves in the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,25,2022-10-11 15:40:13
3014," I'd already started tightening monetary policy, raising their policy rates, adjusting course if you want for their own economies and found themselves in a different position compared to, say, the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England. But this stress coming from the dollar are really important. They play out through multiple channels. They increase inflation in the rest of the world because a lot of goods are invoiced in dollars and they also increase financial stress because countries or corporations that have debt in dollars find that it becomes harder to service them. Now if you want to think about how countries should address that, our recommendation at this point is that these movements in the dollar are really reflecting fundamental forces that are at play, the fight against inflation, the energy crisis. And so countries should try to sort of let the exchange rate adjust and accommodate because it reflects an underlying change in the economy. Pierre, Olivia Garene-Chas, the IMF's chief economist, really appreciate your time today. And our thanks to Yahoo Finance is Jen Chamburger as well. Thank you. Now to clean energy, a stark report from the IEA last year outlined the need for a concerted effort to deliver sustainable energy to the developing world. It said annual clean energy investment in these economies needs to increase by more than 7 times if net zero by 2050 is to become a reality. One group working towards this goal is the climate investment funds. One of the world's biggest multilateral funds for climate action and developing nations last week it received a fresh $950 million loan from the U.S. Treasury joining us now for a weekly charging forward segment brought to you by BMW, is Daniel Morris, CIF, Senior Climate Change Specialist. Good to talk to you today. Let's start with that big injection. I mean, it is a loan, not necessarily a capital injection, but how do you plan to deploy that capital? Yeah, thanks, Akiko. The loan that we received from the U.S. really helps support our new Accelerating Coal Transition Program. It's a program that's been developed over the past couple of years to help some of the key emerging economies that are very reliant on coal, accelerate and move away from using that power source and toward more renewable power sources. So within the program, there are kind of four major countries that are participating India, Indonesia, South Africa and the Philippines. And this large loan will help execute projects that are under design now. Right now those countries are putting together investment plans that will lay out how they intend to deploy investments and bring co-finance years into support over the next few years. And that will be a big part of that. Daniel, we're just a few weeks out from COP27 over in Egypt. I'm thinking back to the big pledges that were made on climate financing a year ago. The argument would be that certainly a lot of these governments, as well as companies, haven't really put their backed up their actions with the pledges they've made. When you look globally where the need is right now, where do you see it? You know, when it comes to tackling a problem like climate change, there are so many needs that it's hard to isolate them. So I think you need to deploy a broad approach. You know, I work in the clean energy and clean tech sector. And we have a lot of resources that we can bear on different things, investments in different types of technologies that establish technologies like solar and wind and emerging technologies like say energy storage, immobility, green hydrogen. That needs a lot. And we're starting to see more and more of that. Of course, we need a lot more if we want to reach the goals that the international community has set out. But we also need to see a lot more investment in adaptation and resilience. A lot of countries, especially lower income countries, those that haven't really contributed much to the climate crisis of feeling the effects in really catastrophic ways. The most tangible example right now is Pakistan, where the flooding in August resulted in over 30 million being displaced. We need to build more climate resilient communities and the international finance community really needs to start to focus on those with a lot of large scale and a lot of power brought to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,26,2022-10-11 15:44:23
3015," in the international finance community really needs to start to focus on those. With a lot of, with large scale and a lot of power brought to bear to try and protect people from what will continue to be a change in climate. Daniel, really quickly we've got the World Bank IMF meetings happening over in DC. This comes at a time when we had an op-ed coming out from former Treasury Secretary Larry Somersign that the World Bank just is not doing enough in terms of financing some of these projects. When you think about the need globally, how much of this falls on the development banks, how much of it is on government, how much of it is on the private sector? How do you look at that breakdown? Yeah, I mean, it's a great question. I think I can talk a little bit about our experience in the climate investment funds. We are a fund that uses six multilateral development banks as our implementing entities. So we work with the World Bank, we work with the International Finance Corporation, the Regional Development Banks. When you look at our overall portfolio, about a third of our co-finance in comes from the private sector, another third comes from the MDVs themselves, and then we also have national governments in their bilateral institutions. It really is all hands on deck. I think that public financing really needs to pave the way to support communities that are in danger. And, you know, kind of men and bring their power to bear. Daniel Morris, Climate Investment Fund, Senior Climate Change Specialist. Good to talk to you today. Well, coming up, getting alternative. Alternative, that's right, need a series of differentiated investment strategies at your fingertips and all under one roof. Our next guest might have something for you. Julie, I'm on the road for us today. Join us on the other side. Thank you. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. I'm Julie Heimann live at the Greenwich Economic Forum in Greenwich, Connecticut. And a big focus here of the speakers today and of the subjects of conversation is on alternative investments. Those outside sort of stocks and bonds. And my next guest knows a lot about this area.

3016," Speakers today and of the subjects of conversation is on alternative Investments those outside sort of stocks and bonds and my next guest knows a lot about this area He's Matt Brown founder and CIO of case which is a firm that basically provides a Technology platform for many of those alternative investments. So before we dig into it Can you just tell me a little bit more about what you guys do? Absolutely, first of all, thanks for having me. It's great to be here Case as you said is a technology platform And what we do is we connect the very fragmented a universe of financial advisors across America With the leading alternative investment funds. So think private equity private credit hedge fund strategies real estate strategies And the reason that's valuable is because those two communities really didn't have access to each other Prior to a technology that allows it to be easy and simple to connect Well, and I feel like retail investors writ large didn't really have access to these kinds of investment that thinking always was You had to well you have to be an accredited investor Which you know means also among other things that you have to have a certain amount of money Do you think all of that needs to change do you think we need to have sort of radical accessibility to these kinds of investments? Well, the world is changing and there's really a moment in time now that we're seeing a lot of forces Come to play there's really four major trends that are coming together and you mentioned one of them And so we want to we just start there which is the regulatory environment on who governs who can access alternative investments I think previously as you said you know the bar was quite high The SEC's view was if you know invest in alternatives We want you to have a lot of capital just in case it doesn't work out I think where they realized over the last 10 years is that all except really done their job What they've done is be able to take advantage of unique opportunities at the public markets don't offer while protecting the downside of investors and Tribulant times like we're having now and the SEC now is kind of saying wait a second Maybe we've excluded too many people and not made it more broadly available So they're changing the modifying their stance on that which is creating a much more Inclusive investing environment and very much along the themes of democratization of access Yeah, and to your point it's not as if you're insulated from downside if you're in the equity market Well, I mean that's the you know the 60 40 portfolio. I can say it here. I think is officially over I think markets like this have really just once again demonstrated that you know You can't just have a portfolio that is only equities and fixed income The modern portfolio is really a three-dimensional portfolio It's stocks bonds and alternative investments and most people are talking that it's gonna be 50 You know 50 30 20 and 20 being of course alternative investments That said do you think that there is a risk with more people getting involved in alternative Investments I see just the opposite you know We look at the some of the greatest asset managers in the alternative space many of which are on our platform and available You know decade after decade they've delivered I would argue that you know if you're a financial advisor and you're not Allocating your clients capital in alternative investments. You're at risk of losing your business That's the impact positive impact all it's are having I mean at the same time if we are headed into a downturn during the financial crisis Certainly all it's we're not immune if anything some of them were the sources of some of the you know fractures that we saw within the system Well, I think when you look at the track record of how portfolios perform In good times and in times like we have right now with high volatility. They're added value far exceeds any kind of negative impact that one or two could have You know you look at the largest and most sophisticated investors in the world institutional investors average allocation rates to alternative investments 30 to 50% of their portfolio overall Interestingly look at that same lens on wealth management in America which controls $40 trillion less than 5% probably closer to 2 to 3% but it's rising Advisor demand is picking up asset managers see wealth as a huge market of new clients for them and new investors Regulation as we mentioned is changing and now with this technology that's going to make it all easier So all of this implies that even if we're seeing a pullback generally potentially and things like software spending That maybe you're not seeing that in your business or are you what are you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,28,2022-10-11 15:53:12
3017," All of this implies that even if we're seeing a pullback generally potentially and things like software spending that maybe you're not seeing that in your business or are you what are you seeing right now among your clients at a time where we're seeing that increased volatility. So it's interesting as a platform provider we're neutral. So we don't really have a dog in the fight we observe. We want to provide the service. Well you're neutral but your clients who make their money on it are not necessarily neutral. Right. So are they pulling are they even trenching? Yes. So what we're seeing is three or four really defined areas with the European uncertainty with the Ukraine situation with an energy crisis with the political environment here in the US all that rising interest rates rising inflation all that's factoring into the psyche of the advisor and the end of client. So what we are observing on our platform is where the money is going. So we're actually standing back and saying okay where are the advisors allocating so they're allocating to macro strategies right now. Edge fund strategies that are nimble and opportunistic. They're allocating to private credit and real assets. So it's quite interesting to see the ebbs and flows of capital flows into different strategies based on the current economic environment. Well we'll have to catch up with you again in a few months and see where those flows are going. Matt Brown, Fender and CEO of Case. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Keep it right here and much more Yahoo Finance coming your way next. Well a few cases from the Supreme Court that we're watching this morning the first being a possible rolling on a California law that affects animal welfare. Alexis Keenan is here to tell us more on that. Alexis. Hi, Ekiiko. Yeah, so this is a $26 billion industry, the pork industry. So the court's decision here will matter tremendously for these litigants. Now the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments today in this case and it's brought by the National Port Producer's Council along with the American Farm Bureau Federation against the state of California, which in 2018 adopted a law that said any of the uncooked pork sold in the state must come from animals that were kept in pens that were at least 24. So that's a huge change for square feet of living space. Now that is 10 more square feet than the industry standard. So that is a huge change. The industry folks they say well that's going to drive up the cost of production and they also.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,29,2022-10-11 15:57:12
3018," That is 10 more square feet than the industry standard. So that is a huge change. The industry folks, they say, well, that's going to drive up the cost of production. And they also say that it will drive up, therefore, the cost of the pork that is sold across the country. Now, they're challenging, making this challenge under the Commerce Clause, and it's particularly the dormant part of the Congress Clause, where Congress doesn't act. They say that that prevents state laws, which it traditionally has done, from disrupting national markets. So they're in court. They're continuing arguments right now about whether or not they will be able to block California from using this role. Really quickly. Another case that you're watching that could affect fair use? Yes. So this is the fair use doctrine that we even as news broadcasters use. It affects artists. It affects teachers. Those who take works of art and use them and change them so that they can use them either temporarily. Or in a transformative way. And this case comes after the late Andy Warhol's images were used by Condi Nast in a 2016 magazine. And there are photos that were taken by the famous photographer Lynn Goldsmith. And they were changed to make these silkscreen images that you see here. And Goldsmith says she wasn't paid for the second time these images were used. And so that has opened up this debate about whether fair use in its old traditional form will be able to exist as is. There's a challenge to the language of this transformative use. So it could really change the way that we use works of art and other images, both in news and across different industries. Okay. Two big cases. We'll continue to watch. Thanks so much for that Alexis. Finally, a developing story that we've been watching right now. Gig economy stocks under pressure coming after the Biden Labor Department released a proposal that could make it possible for gig workers to be reclassified as employees rather than contractors. And we have seen those gig economy stocks take a big hit there. You're taking a look at Uber right now down about 7% lift down more than 8% door dash down 6%. Let's do a final check of the broader markets before we let you go. We are seeing green here at the top of the board here. The S&P 500 now turning into the green here, but the NASDAQ continuing to weigh on the broader markets. Remember yesterday we saw the NASDAQ hit a two year intro day low right now trading pretty flat. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and yak to finance life.

3019," Music a little bit of a downward push here to start the week with key earnings and inflation data on tap. Our next guest says investors should look to reach real estate investment trusts. They haven't been immune to recent volatility but are quote well prepared in this current environment. National Association of Reats economist John Worth joined us now. John, you know, I think of REITs as a group that are vulnerable when there's rising interest rate environment for a number of different reasons. They tend to carry relatively high levels of debt, right? So their service and costs are higher. And they're seen as sort of because of their high dividend yields as almost a competing asset for something like treasuries as their yields are going higher. So talk us through why you think they're well positioned here. I'm absolutely happy to do it. You know, I think the view of REITs as being high leverage players is one that is a little bit out of date, frankly. What we've seen is that REIT leverage has been coming down for basically a decade. So today we've got leverage ratios near all time lows. The debt that REITs are holding is quite well termed out. They've got a weighted average term to maturity today of about seven years plus net interest expense as a share of their operating income is at all time lows. And about 85% of their debt is fixed rate. So they're really quite well positioned for a period of rising interest rates. And just as we compare them to other income-generating alternatives, it's important to keep in mind that REITs provide income, but they're not fixed income, right? So they provide both income through their steady dividends as well as capital appreciation opportunities. And typically what we see is that in a period where you're coming out of a, where you're coming out of a potential period of slow growth as we might be in about a year that we see REITs do quite well. So why would someone look at REITs versus, say, high growth internet at this point, even though high growth internet is perhaps being redefined, REITs still have to compete for the same attention when investors are looking to get back into the market as they do against technology or some of the other more flashy names. Yeah, and I think it's important to think about that from a portfolio construction perspective. One of the things we see is that commercial real estate is such a fundamental piece of the overall economy. That's really critical for investors of all types. But is commercial real estate still as necessary if you have less people that are going into offices or there's more of a hybrid work approach? Is it still carrying the same weight? Absolutely. I think you really need to think about the breadth of commercial real estate. I think many investors think about it as office and retail, but it's a really much broader space. So for example, in REITs, you have data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. So you're getting the breadth of the economy that's housing the modern, the breadth of the real estate that's housing the modern economy. So you may feel like hybrid work is going to have people in the office less. That means you're going to have more activity through data centers, cell phone towers, logistics facilities. It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,31,2022-10-11 16:05:58
3020," It reads, provide a way to grab the whole breadth of the real estate space. John, maybe I'm looking at it too simplistically here, but if we are going into recession next year, that might kick people out of their homes. Doesn't that mean some of those public storage names should do well, like they did in the Great Recession? Yeah, I don't think public storage and the other self-storage places are really going to benefit significantly from people maybe losing their homes. What we see is that that's a sector where we saw a huge bump during COVID, a huge bump in demand as people used the space they had differently. So they cleared out the guest room, they cleared out the garage and turned those into gyms and maybe schoolrooms in some cases. And that gave a huge bump to self-storage demand. And then that was got another dose of demand as the residential real estate market heated up. As that market falls down, we may see some diminution in demand. But whenever you have people making transitions in their lives, whether that's moving, sending kids to school, bringing kids back into the household, what you see is that they're using self-storage as part of that. All right, you gave me a whole new reason to rewatch storage towards National Association of Reats Economists. John Worth, John, appreciate the time here today. Thanks. A.B. Bernstein is getting bullish on Airbnb. Initiating coverage and outperform what they $143 price target, saying it's rapid and profitable growth removes a key hurdle. It's valuation. Joining us now is Richard Clark, managing director at A.B. Bernstein. Richard, there's a number of things that you highlight here. But really the point being that this isn't just about Airbnb being able to protect its market share and the vacation rental business. You think they could really make a significant play on hotels and experiences as well. Why can't we do that thesis? Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. So we think the vacation rental market is still very exciting. I think it's a big market. It's going to gain share of the overall lodging market. And Airbnb will gain share within that. But probably beyond that, even more exciting, is that ability to sell more than just vacation rental market. It doesn't market as much as other travel platforms. So it has a loyal customer following. It has a very strong brand. We think they can sell longer stays, hotel rooms, experiences, and they can add to its growth. The longer stays have been a real growth spot for Airbnb something they've been highlighting, especially over the course of the pandemic. The hotels specifically, where do you see them making a play when you look at how fragmented the market is right now? Yeah, so I mean, I think actually the hotel market is fragmented. The distribution market is not that fragmented. You've got booking and expedia. They're quite dominant in their respect to geography. So I think the actual hotels are looking for other distribution channels to broaden their landscape a little bit. And I think Airbnb is unique in the sense that it does try and inspire the customer.

It tries to find a way to match the customer and the product up in the way that we don't see in other companies. And I think that gives it a way to make a play in hotels. So you see the platform evolving into a place where hotels can also list their openings? Well, they're already on. I mean, there are already tens of thousands of hotels listed on Airbnb, or hotels in the night. They signed a deal with Side Minder. They signed a deal with OVO. And that gave them probably somewhere around 70 to 80,000 hotels. But that's only just scratching the surface. There's probably 10 times that many hotels in the world. And I think through COVID, they focus on the core business. And hotels is one thing that they can try and re-ignite post the other side of COVID. And yet put it alongside the vacation rentals on its platform. Richard, we've been talking so much about a lot of these companies within the sharing economy, whether that's in Uber, food delivery, Airbnb among them. They all started after the great recession. And it was sort of an earlier days used as a platform for a lot of people to make some extra cash on the side. How much of a catalyst do you think? If we are looking at a further downturn in the macro picture, I mean, could that be a potential catalyst for Airbnb to bring in more hosts and really expand the platform in a way? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I think first of all, there's quite a lot of dormant hosts on Airbnb, like there's a lot of listening that haven't taken a booking in the last year. And maybe that's because of COVID, nervousness around that. So maybe part of it is bringing existing hosts back onto the platform. And then, yeah, I think beyond that, there probably are other people that will need to supplement their income. They'll need to offset the fact that maybe they're paying higher mortgage costs or higher rental costs. And that may bring entirely new supply to the market. Okay, Amy Burns, see Managing Director Richard Clark, appreciate your time today. Thank you. One of the Fed's biggest critics of late is that it again, speaking on CBS yesterday. Aliens' chief economic advisor, Muhammad Al-Aryan, said he fears, quote, a very high probability of damaging a recession that was totally avoidable. He'll track higher in the aftermath of Friday's jobs, report him, it indications the Fed will need to continue its hiking round. Our next guest says a hard landing is likely. Let's get into the discussion with George O'Bouray. He's all spring, global investments, chief investments, strategies for fixed income. George, that doesn't sound promising. Hi, Kiko, thanks for having me on the show. It's a rough backdrop. It's a rough economic backdrop. And one of the challenges that the Fed faces is that at this juncture in the cycle, good news is effectively bad. And that's simply because the Fed is trying to fight inflation. We know that. They've been at it now for quite some time throughout this year. They still feel behind the curve. We're going to see the data. We're going to see a new set of inflation data on Thursday with the CPI report. Expectations are. Headline CPI should come down a little, but core inflation is likely to keep rising. And it's really.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,33,2022-10-11 16:14:45
3022," Thursday with the CPI report, expectations are, you know, headline CPI should come down a little, but core inflation is likely to keep rising. And it's really, when you take that inflation data, plus the strong, relatively strong employment data from Friday, it would suggest that the economy in the US is still expanding and it's still chugging along at a pretty good pace. And the Fed has told us very clearly that they want to slow that down. So from other commentators from us as well, the expectation is the Fed's going to get what they want. They need to slow growth. They will slow growth. And if you look into the first half of next year, the sort of lag defect of all these rate hikes should start to bite. And so the probability of a recession, it's going up. And we think it's actually going up fairly quickly. And that's likely to really start to unfold as we get into the beginning part of next year. So how does that set things up going into the next FOMC meeting? And there's certainly a debate on this sidelines that's happening about whether, in fact, the Fed should maybe pause a bit here to really allow for those rate hikes that have already been implemented to take root. Are we getting any indications of that potential pause, especially when you say the risk of a recession is growing? Well, the Fed has kind of painted themselves into a box. They've said that they're going to respond to the data and they've sort of taken a much more of a near term approach. They need to see current data demonstrate that inflation is coming down on a sustained basis. That takes sort of multiple months. It's going to take time. It's also going to require a broadening out of the data. So the Fed doesn't have a lot of wiggle room in here from our perspective. They need to continue to tighten and tighten policy. The question is, is simply how fast? A pivot at this point, at best case scenario from a pivot standpoint, is they're able to decelerate the pace of rate hikes. Now, if Wednesday's data surprisingly comes in below expectations on both the headline and a core basis, that might provide the window of hope or open the window, if you will, for a bit of hope that a pivot of sorts might be coming. But it's still premature in our opinion. You haven't seen that sort of clear evidence to give the Fed kind of cover to really start to pivot. Now, the one thing that is not really discussed all that much is just market volatility. Volatility in the bond market is very high right now. And it's likely to stay high as long as these expectations for tighter policy continue. With high volatility, some comes sort of a lot of movement in prices by definition, but liquidity also tends to dry up. If the market kind of ceases to function, well, then the Fed will have to do something. But we're not at that point yet. The market's functioning at a slow pace, but it is still functioning. George, really quickly here, it is a holiday today, but when you look at where the 10-year yield has tracked, I mean, we're off of that level of just being under four, but we're still at 3, 8, 8, based on Friday's close. How much, where do you expect it to track, at least in any turn? Yeah, that's a good point. There's a big distinction between the front end of the curve and the longer end of the curve. We've repriced up, if you will, we're up about 25 basis points or so on the 10-year. As you mentioned, up around 3, 88, 4% is our number that we expect the 10-year to consolidate around that number. We would say plus or minus 25 basis points on each side of 4%. Is really our central case as we go into the end of the year. The front end, the Fed has also been pretty clear. They want to get the front end up to about 4.5% by year end. So a 50 basis point spread, say, between the two-year and the 10-year with the two-year above the 10-year, that would be pretty consistent with tight monetary policy, restrictive monetary policy, and that should help slow growth as we go into next year.

3024," And how quickly would you be able to move on that, specifically on LNG? Well, we're urging Congress and the Administration to act quickly on all components of this plan. I think on LNG, it's really a question of a commitment from the government to expedite applications, a commitment from Europe to build down the necessary infrastructure to take the natural gas into its countries. But there is a commitment there on both sides, and so what we need is an acceleration of that. The oil and gas industry stands ready to help. There is another, I am, a legislation that's been floating around for some time, and this is no PAC, specifically stands for no oil producing and exporting cartels act. This would essentially empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC under anti-trust rules if they are seen as setting or at least trying to attempt to control the price of oil. The Biden Administration, at least in their statements, seems to suggest they want to revisit that. But I know API has specifically been very opposed to this idea. Why? This policy has been opposed on both sides of the aisle and from administrations in both parties. The real way to get OPEC is to produce more energy here in the United States. And the way to do that is to lift the pause that the administration has had on leasing. Look, at this point in the Obama administration, they had issued 60 leases for oil and gas development. At this point in the Biden Administration, they're just at six. And so if the administration wants to get serious about energy security and energy independence, it needs to look right here at home, and it needs to provide a pathway for more energy production here in the United States. Finally, Frank, you sort of alluded to the need for more exports coming out of the US at a time when there are concerns about supply globally. You have put out a letter here saying that any kind of export ban we're talking about diesel, but also refined products would deplete inventory levels and it would put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices. Of course, the administration argument would be, we'll add a time when there was concerns about supply crunch, that supply should be left domestically. So walk me through your calculation. Why does this deplete supply in your opinion? And why would that push prices higher? Sure, it's not our opinion in July of this year, the American Council for Capital Formation studied this issue. They found that an export ban on refined product would end up cutting refinery capacity by 1.3 million barrels per day here in the United States. It would end up raising costs for fuel for consumers across the United States. It would cost jobs, about 85,000 jobs would be lost under such a policy. And finally, it would harm American GDP. And so for all of those reasons and for American energy security, the refined export product ban is a bad idea. Finally, this administration has made a commitment to our allies overseas to other countries that we support. To Latin America, where we export an enormous amount of refined product, it's made a commitment to those allies that we're going to continue to provide the energy that we have right here in the United States. I see no reason why the administration should turn its back on that commitment. And it would certainly imposing such a policy would certainly not help the American consumer. And where are those conversations stand right now with the administration? I know there's been a bit of a back and forth. Oftentimes, it has been reported as being a little more contentious. In terms of specifically an export ban, what's your understanding of where the administration stands? Well, we've made the case. We've laid out the data that shows that such a policy would have negative implications for the American people, for the driving public. I think the administration understands that. I think they understand that these are global products that require global markets. I think they also understand that the United States says world-class leading refineries, and they produce the fuels that the world needs. And so we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or L.A.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,36,2022-10-11 16:27:46
3025," that the world needs. And so, you know, we're hopeful that the administration steps back from considerations of export ban, whether it's crude oil, refined product, or LNG, frankly looks toward American energy production as the solution. We've set all along the solution to the challenges that we face, actually lie under our feet because of innovation and technology. We've increased production here in the United States from seven million barrels to 12 million barrels per day. We can do more, but we need the policies in place to help us achieve that. Frank McEarola, API Senior Vice President of Policy Economics and Regulatory Affairs, appreciate your time today. Sure, thank you. So, let's take a while to look on market, TD Ameritrade out with its Investor Movement Index, showing traders to go more risk off approach in September for more about what these results mean and what's driving the trends. Let's bring in Sean Cruz, TD Ameritrade Head, trading strategists. Sean, these notes are always really interesting to me, a very good gauge of where the retail investor stands feels like it's pretty much tracking with the rest of the market. Things just aren't feeling very good. Yeah, I think right now, we got a little bit of a head fake back in August. There was actually recovery. For the first time this year, we actually had that Investor Movement Index tick higher. And I think that quickly got wiped off the table in September. So, what we did see in what clients were buying, they were certainly being a little bit more conservative and that they weren't going out there buying some of the more speculative areas of the market, some of the more speculative names that maybe aren't profitable right now or just have some very high multiples. They're not really reaching for those right now. They're going back to some of the more familiar established names out there. In some cases, really looking at names with quality fundamentals, be that solid revenues, solid cash flow, healthy balance sheets, leverage was another thing that they certainly have been a little bit wary of as we're starting to see rates tick higher and higher that is going to impact some of those more highly leveraged companies versus the more fundamentally sound companies. So, they still found some opportunities out there but they certainly are a little bit cautious right now and I think that makes sense. And we're going to get to some of those names we just showed on the screen there, but probably speaking, what has led to the sell-off that you have seen exiting of positions? Is it really just about the Fed? I think that really was what drove that optimism in August and that light at the end of the tunnel from the Fed, Pausian or potentially even reverse in some of those rate hikes gave it drove a lot of optimism, but like I said, that light at the end of the tunnel ended up being a train coming your way instead. And that really drove that shift in sentiment in that not only were we getting some data that did indicate they haven't made significant progress. They are starting to have an effect, look at housing for instance, but they're the Fed kept coming out. Whenever the market would give a little bit of a pop of optimism, you would almost have a Fed speaker somewhere and somewhere come out and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion and that's why we're trading down at the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,37,2022-10-11 16:31:56
3026," I'm gonna work about and say, look, we're not stopping. This is something we are committed to. I think they're coming around to that notion and that's why we're trading down at these levels. I think the market's gonna respond differently to maybe a hawkish Fed when we're trading at 3600 on the S&P 500 versus say trading up at 4,040, 200. So I do think a lot of that is now priced in if things get significantly worse and that's why we just spoke about the bank earnings. That is going to be huge. The macro read through on what we hear from the banks. I think it's really gonna set the tone for the rest of earnings seasons. And I think the market is also going to change their macro outlook based on what we hear. So let's talk about some of those names that we have seen big moves in. In terms of net buyers, we're seeing a lot of the chip makers. You could argue that's part of evaluation play given just how far some of these names have pulled back. But in terms of those that are being sold, Exxon mobile and BP, an interesting one to me because energy has been pretty strong. Is this sort of the expectation that we have reached the peak with some of these names and the pullback is coming? That is where we see that type of activity. I don't think anyone expects crude oil to completely fall apart anytime soon. But I do think they're looking at it from a little bit more of a valuation standpoint. And we've seen that where you get these energy companies trading towards the bottom of their range. That's where there's a lot of interest in buying when they recover and they start hidden towards the upper end of those ranges. That's where they rotate out of those. So I think it's an interesting strategy. It's more of a short-term strategy. I think we see playing out, but they use those profits when they do decide to roll out and lower exposure in those names. We actually do see them going out there and trying to find opportunity elsewhere. And I, semiconductors last month, was that key spot. I think we saw a lot of interest on the buy side. Certainly today I think caught a lot of people off guard. If you look at the semiconductors that are really getting hit, it's the semiconductor companies that really have a lot of exposure to that relationship with China and just what goes on the entrepreneur offshore aspect of their supply chains. But I think what they were looking at, if you look at the charts, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, all those names were hitting the support levels. And when you see the support levels, these ranges, they start to approach the lower end. That's where you get a lot of buying activity. I'm going to venture, guess we look at this again next month. We're going to see a lot of selling as they broke through some of those. I was going to say, I wonder if some of that buying holds, especially as we get these warnings about demand, especially from a lot of these big chip makers, TSMC and other ones. We're expected to hear from this week. Sean Cruz, a TD Ameritrade, head trading strategist. Thanks so much for joining us today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,38,2022-10-11 16:36:34
3027," Well, German carmaker Sonomotors is on a mission to make mobility and growing megacities. More sustainable for more on that, the CEO of the EV startup, standing by with our very own pros, supermanian, live from the NASDAQ, pros. That's right, if you can hear it, the NASDAQ Sonomotors actually listed on the NASDAQ, their German company listed here. They have their Sion solar powered EV here, by the behind us. Joining me now is CEO, Lauren Hahn. So Lauren talked to us about the Sion, the here in the States. What's going on exactly? Sure, a nice to be here. This is the first solar electric vehicle being affordable. We brought it the first time to the US, first hand, first day here. Incredible car, $25,000, family, apparently affordable solar cells in the whole car body. It's re-churching itself and it's really meant to be that mass market electric vehicle. You know when I mentioned this to people before they talked to me, you've got a solar powered car, that's not totally true. You've got to look at it and plug it in to get more power. What kind of solar power, what kind of range are we going to get capture from the sun for those people? Yes. Giving you an example, beautiful day here in the US and New York. We have 12 miles per day being commuted in the city on average. This car is re-churching at 13 miles a day. It's 7th, 7th tea miles a week on average. That's amazing because that means no re-churching for most of the commuters. That's the big asset about electric vehicles, re-churching. We're in part, we're in a charging station, range anxiety, all that stuff. That's what people are worried about and this car is still solving that issue. So you know, this car has a total range of around 200 miles per charge. What you're saying is that, given how people use the car normally, you can basically capture as much solar power as you need to use the car on a regular basis, let's say you can get your car on by miles each way. So what we're saying is for most people, it makes sense for solar. Exactly. Commuters. People are using the car to get from A to B to work, right? And they're not driving like 200, 300 miles to work. No, they're driving on average 12 miles as a set. This car is re-searching itself. That's the biggest hurdle about electric vehicles and we're solving it. So where are you guys going to launch it? You're in Germany, what's the rollout to this car exactly? So the first launch is in Europe. We have 42,000 down payments and brewers in total from B to B and B to C. And we're right now, you know, bringing out the plan for the US. We have a great plan for the US. There's huge potential here. We see huge potential for suburban markets here. Family-friendly vehicles affordable $25,000. So taking kind of a step back with this car, $25,000, very affordable. You do the solar power element. Why did you guys decide that was the way to go for EVs? Not just the grid, but capturing from the solar power plants to get every day. Well, because I, you know, myself asked myself, what's a great product? And I'm living in the furt floor and don't have an own house. I don't have a own garage. And I asked myself, where do I charge? Where do I charge my electric vehicle, right? And I came always through the conclusion, it's not working. I need something more than that. And that's why we integrate it solar because we believe it's convenience. It's extending your range. It's highly affordable because you don't have to pay for high electricity bills there, right? Yeah. And is there more incentives in places like Europe for those sort of thing? Or is it sort of a cross-core? Are you guys getting any kind of incentive? Well, there are incentives for electric vehicles, I think across the world. And every own country, you get like certain incentives. There are countries starting to incentive by a solar electric vehicle. Take a Holland and Holland Derries and incentive for solar electric vehicles. So on top of the electric vehicle centers, in centers you get a solar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,39,2022-10-11 16:40:55
3028," Take Holland and Holland Derrius and incentive for solar electric vehicles. So on top of the electric vehicle centers, you get a solar electric vehicle center. So you see the whole industry is changing to solar electric vehicles. As we believe, the next big thing in the electromobility. So what are we talking about in terms of free orders here for the car globally? And also you got some deals in the works with car sharing, right? Yes. Yes. Right. As mentioned, 42,000 downpapers and free orders. It's 22,000 B2SBE and 20,000 B2C reservations. The B2C reservation being downpainted with amazing 2,000 euros an average. So sticky, real reservations. People putting down 2,000 euros for this car on the waiting list. Amazing. And with that, we have the full auto book already for Europe. Right now going on tour here. New York, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, NLA. And we'll test the demand there. We already get great feedback. You also have this deal with FID, which I believe is a rental car company. Yes. How does that work? It's a subscription car company. They ordered just 12,600 cars. It's an amazing order. We have so much more potential in the B2B sector. This is the perfect car for being an Uber driver, for being delivery service, for being a subscription car model. We believe there's so much more potential out there. So real quick, we talk about this deal with FID. You guys using valnet to actually make the cars, because you have cars with a third party manufacturer. Yes. How soon are we going to see these cars in the road? Four planets to launch this car and produce this car in the second half of next year. We have a great partnership with the volumetric. There are being very experienced over 40, 50 years of building cars. They currently producing the Diameter GLC and GLA. So they know how to produce cars. And we believe we will not have production hell as you call it. Because we have outsourced the production to someone who actually knows how to produce electric vehicles. So second half of next year, potentially in Europe. And then maybe in the US we'll see the tour is happening right now across the United States. Exactly. Lauren Hunt. Thanks so much, Sonomotors. Back over to you, Kiko. I know there's a bit of a delay between us, but really quickly I'm seeing people check out the car behind you. When Lauren doesn't let you take a ride. Yeah, what are we going to get to ride in this car, Lauren? I'll soon. Oh, yeah, you can actually tomorrow. Tomorrow. So today here is a little difficult. Tomorrow we will have some test rides. So sign up on our website and you can come and grab a ride with this vehicle. All right, thanks, Kiko for putting that up for me. Oh, yeah, to see you with that. I know you've driven many of these EVs. I'm going to be curious to get your review on that. I'll probably thank so much for that. A live press from the NASDAQ Market Sightner.

3029, you The Dobie Analytics forecast online sales in November and December to rise just 2.5% percent that's the slowest rates since 2015 and also it compares to 8.6% just a year ago where we headed Christine short as the VP of research for Wall Street horizon Christine nice to see you so I guess tomorrow is kind of like Black Friday on a Tuesday in early October it's a little confusing how much does this change everything these October sales in terms of traditional holiday sales? Well we've been seen as for a few years right like the Black Friday the holiday sales keep getting moved early and earlier and that's because consumers are demanding it they want to spread out their shopping over a longer period of time it used to be a day after Thanksgiving through cyber Mondays you know you got about five days of deals now you've got a couple months of deals so I think we're responding to consumer demand I think it's also really smart for a lot of these retailers Ali mentioned it's not just Amazon but it's Target Walmart you've got some of the department stores may see these coals bed bath and beyond they're all doing this because what research and which surveys have shown is that consumers are getting a little more anxious about inflation they feel okay about their job position unemployment so very historically low but as the year goes on something consumers are looking at so why not get your holiday shopping out of the way now what does it mean for shopping later I think it just spreads out a little more you might actually have a chance to get more money out of consumers but I think by front loading it it's a very smart thing and I think those that are there's always got your late shoppers there will still be people shopping throughout the rest of the year but I think it's smart to start it earlier this year yeah you're talking about me and Sean Smith I'm usually December 23rd ish I'm still waking up to the pumpkin spice latte which was like two months ago axios as a story today saying the traditional holiday shopping season is dead is that true I don't know about that some people really like to do it just as an activity with their family to go in person the day after Thanksgiving but yeah it's certainly taking a big hit here right and like I said this has been a trend that's that's been ongoing the last few years but as far as the you know shopping online is still you know continuing to pick up from popularity doesn't mean people aren't going to be spending right a national retail federation with their holiday forecast and survey show that yeah two-thirds of people are still going to spend on gifts on celebrations this year they feel like they haven't been able to do as much last couple of years because of COVID restrictions so whether it means you know taking out of savings or redirecting money that would some otherwise go somewhere else or even going into credit card debt they will be spending money this holiday season now that we're kind of getting back to normal the story of this retail year has been an inventory issue too much of it is that still the case and is there anyone that got it right yeah you know we went into this saying you know the bigger sophisticated retailers like your target like your Walmart they they set up for last holiday season we thought they were going to get it right they weren't new to this clearly they didn't there was loads of inventory on the shelves for many of those big retailers I think we've had over a year now to get it right so I think retailers heading into this holiday season are certainly in a better position so that's not as much of a concern this year and so I think that that's one thing we don't necessarily have to worry about costs are still very high right so we're talking a little about Amazon here despite the fact that this is probably going to be a great prime event the costs over the last few quarters have been eating into those revenues so that's something we're going to look out for as well is this a positive story though will it be for the holiday season this bulk and inventory should,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,41,2022-10-11 16:49:12
3030," into those revenues, so that's something we're going to look out for as well. Is this a positive story, though? Will it be for the holiday season? This bulk and inventory should result in discount should be a deflationary and even a positive Fed story, although not a great earning story. Yeah, like Ali said, it's anything to push the inventory and to give deep discounts. So it is a complex situation where you've got higher costs and inflation is creating higher costs for everything, right? But the consumer really wants value right now. So you have to be offering discounts and some of the ones that we've seen already as advertised from target from Amazon, we're talking 50 to 80% off of some of the most popular items. So they're actually willing to take a hit in some ways just to get to the consumer who really is looking for the deepest discounts possible right now. So promotions are going to be huge and pushing out some of that extra inventory. On a great investor's story, but it is a good consumer story. Want to come full circle back to the story we started with where online sales rising just 2.5%. But the brick and mortar stories, the real fascinating one, more stores opened in 21 then close for the first time since 1995, according to Morgan Stanley, what is the deal with brick and mortar making a comeback? You know, I think people miss that. They miss the brick and mortar. We've seen, like you said, e-commerce sales have come down since the peak of COVID where they were really at their highest. So I think you're going to see more of a blend this year, whereas the story, the last like 10 years for holiday shopping has been that e-commerce it's continuing to pick up. But I think again, it's more of an activity. It's something to do together with friends with family. And so people like going out there, they like looking at the items are buying and honestly, retailers like that too, because there's less things getting returned. And that's what we're seeing a third of things bought online and up getting returned because you really haven't had a chance to see and experience it. So if they can get you to buy in brick and mortar, retailers are going to be pretty happy about that. Reports of brick and mortar's death greatly exaggerated Wall Street Horizon VP of research Christine short. Good to see you. Thanks. I'm you.

But this is a very important issue for us for social media companies, willingness to monitor hateful content on their sites. Joining us now for more on this we want to bring in Roger McDonough, Elevation Partners, Managing Director and author of Zuck. Roger, it's great to see you again. Certainly there has been a large debate about content moderation, how how social media comes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,42,2022-10-11 16:54:51
3031," managing director and author of Zuck. Roger, it's great to see you again. Certainly there has been a large debate about content moderation. How social media companies should go about this. I guess just from your perspective, what is as hell is just in terms of where we are when it comes to policies and the handling of hate speech on these social media platforms? The context is that six years ago, there was interference in the UK referendum around Brexit and then the US presidential election. Since then, we've had ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. We've had extraordinary number of terrorist events. We've had the COVID pandemic and the undermining of the country's response to that. We've had the insurrection with stop the steal. We've had extraordinary damage done to democracy, to public health, to public safety, to people's ability to make their own choices. And yet, policymakers have done nothing, absolutely nothing. And I think that the whole situation with Kanye West, with Elon Musk attempting to buy Twitter, really highlights the extraordinary inaction. And frankly, in my mind, really unpardonable inaction by Congress, by the President, to do something about what is clearly a threat, not just to safety in the country, but especially the national security. Twitter has a whistleblower who showed that there are people inside Twitter who are working for foreign governments. And for a platform that has as much influence on politics and democracy as Twitter has, that's extraordinarily dangerous. And so Roger, where does the conversation go in terms of accountability for those posting, as well as those moderating, and the pace at which they're able to monitor these things? So I'm not at all confident that we can fix this problem. There are three aspects of it. The first is the scale of the platforms. Facebook, for example, where the worst offenses have taken place has literally billions of posts every day. So the notion that you're going to somehow effectively monitor that number of posts is a big stretch. The second problem is latency, the amount of time, even if you had enough moderators, even if the artificial intelligence worked, which it doesn't. But even if those things worked perfectly, there's still going to be a lag. And the problem is the harm gets done in the first seconds after these harmful posts are put out. The third problem is one of incentives. And this is the one that's killing us, because there is no reason from an economic perspective why these companies should look out for the safety of their users, much less protecting the country's national interest. Right now, the incentives are for them to make as much money as they can, as quickly as they can, and not worry about the consequences. And until that changes, I don't think there's a chance we're going to do anything good about this. There are exceptions. When somebody's really, really bad, the way the Kanye West was this weekend, you will see politically it becomes impossible for these guys not to act, but the rest of the time they're going to do nothing. We'll see how long that ban lasts. Rogers, you know, California has acted when it comes to social media companies. And now, Section 230, at least, is on the plate of the Supreme Court. How, if at all, do you think this could change the situation? You know, it's very, very hard to tell. Section 230 is incredibly important, because what it does is it gives platforms the legal right to maintain the environment of their choosing. So that part of it's really, really good. Where I think things went off the rails is that the platforms chose, because the economics were better, to favor harmful content over good content. Basically hate speech, disinformation, and conspiracy theories are extraordinarily profitable because they trigger flight or fight, so people have to pay attention. And in a business where attention is everything, that kind of content is gonna rise to the surface repeatedly. So we have to change those incentives. I do not think 230 is the way to do that. I think the thing you have to do is to regulate the business model, which is called surveillance capitalism, is this notion that you gather all the data about people, and you use it to manipulate their choices, and to manipulate their behavior. That must change. And we also have to have laws that require safety. The same way we require safety for transportation or healthcare or other things. We need to require safety around these platforms, because the companies have to have an incentive to protect the people who use their systems. And Roger from the conversation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,43,2022-10-11 16:58:25
3032," or health care or other things. We need to require safety around these platforms because the companies have to have an incentive to protect the people who use their systems. And Roger, from the conversations that you're having from people within the industries, from lawmakers, from what we're hearing, just from Capitol Hill, I guess, how confident are you that we will actually see some change? And what does that mean then for some of the largest players in this space like meta and Twitter? I'm not at all confident. We are making progress, but it is incredibly slow in comparison to the damage that these companies are doing. And when I first started talking about this publicly in 2017, it was really obvious to me that the issue was that the culture, the business model, and algorithms of platforms could undermine democracy and civil rights. I went to Congress in the spring and summer of 2017 and then continued to push them to try to do something about it. More than five years have gone by. Several elections have gone by. And insurrection has gone by. A pandemic has been amplified. And yet nothing has been done. So I don't have a lot of confidence because the pressure from the public doesn't exist. And until people start saying, wait a minute, we rarely really value democracy, we really value our public health, we really value public safety. And we recognize that these companies are at danger. Nothing's gonna happen. And Roger, as we saw with Twitter, as they began batting people, we saw apps like Truth Social, some of these other more siloed avenues also pop up as well. What does that do to this picture when you're trying to want to tell these different things, but then having these different siloed platforms coming up as well? To be clear, I think that in the United States, people should be free to say the things that they feel and believe. But not all forms of speech are protected by the First Amendment. You're not allowed to yell fire in a crowded theater. You're not allowed to threaten elected officials. There are lines that people should not be allowed to cross. And the problem we have today is there is no enforcement of those lines. In fact, the lines, I think everybody knows where they are. We just choose to not engage with it. And I don't know how we're gonna solve that problem. I am hopeful. There is more progress today than there's been any time in the last five years, but it's so slow. And I do believe that politicians and frankly, journalists and the citizens, would rather not disrupt the convenience of the status quo to deal with hard problems like this. And I think it's a gigantic issue. And then there's the question, Roger, of what would Elon do? How will Elon Musk impact the situation when you just described if and when he owns Twitter? So the exciting thing for investors is that it does appear that Elon Musk's position in the Delaware Chancellor Court is very bad. So the odds of either a court decision or action by Musk to complete the deal are higher than they've been at any time in this process. And even if he finds a way to weasel out, it looks to me as though it's gonna cost him more than just the breakup fee. So investors in Twitter are probably pretty well positioned, the short term. I can't say the same for America. I mean, the problem with Twitter is they've done a horrible job for years at managing the discourse on the platform. And there's no evidence that Elon Musk has a plan to improve that. In fact, it's not clear what plan he has at all. And what has happened over the last couple of weeks is the disclosure by the court of the text conversations with prospective investors has been super embarrassing for those investors. And that creates some doubt about financing of the deal. And so I don't quite know how this is going to play out at the deal level. What I'm really worried about is that the company will go into a situation where not even investors will be able to have any influence on the outcome. And in that situation with somebody like Musk who seems to rejoice in trolling others and seems to think the trolling is like a really positive value, that for platform where all of politics, all of journalism, and all of celebrity, does its communication, that's just going to increase terrible outcomes. And certainly be tested again in the midterm elections coming up. A big thank you to Roger McDonnelly for joining us this afternoon.

3033," That's just gonna prove terrible outcomes. And certainly be tested again in the midterm elections coming up. A big thank you to Roger McDonnelly for joining us this afternoon. Thank you so much. In this episode of Influencers, Quarkron Group founder, Barbara Quarkron. Well, I see the business as an extension of the person who runs it. Short and simple. I see it on Shark Tank. So much money invested in things that make absolutely no sense. I get so much satisfaction out of helping my businesses that I've invested in. Not because I'm making money over that helps a lot I find after a few years. But I love seeing someone with a dream and thinking I'm part of getting into that dream. Hello everyone and welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Sirward and welcome to our guest Barbara Quarkron founder of the Quarkron Group. We're hosting a host of the podcast on usual business and shark and executive producer on ABC's Shark Tank. Barbara, welcome. Great to see you. Pleasure to be here with you. Thanks. So want to ask you a little bit about this economic environment. Conflation seems to be roaring back and I'm wondering if if people should really take this into account right now and individual or a couple who are looking to make a big purchase or should you try to time it and wait it out. You should move faster because houses are only getting more expensive. It's harder to get your hands on something that you even find acceptable to live with never mind something you've been dreaming about. Interest rates are still low although they've been creeping up and they have promised to continue to go up. And so there's nothing to be gained by waiting whatsoever. Absolutely nothing. You weren't smart enough to get into the market two years ago, a year ago, the idea right now is get into it as fast as you can if you really want to home and beyond the home front. I think it's probably the best market I have ever seen for real estate investing. I think the return on investment is phenomenal and has been in so many markets and so many cities throughout throughout the US. I don't want to see a kinko wrong, but it's probably the best market I've ever seen in my life. So I think real estate is a champion. I'm not saying that because that's my gig because I invested a lot of stuff. But I'm saying it because I've never seen it more tantalizing and with more promise. You want to pick up on that last point, which is real estate is an investment, not your home per se, but I guess you're talking about like a rental property or something like that. I think that's a property or a building with five or six units of 20 units. The numbers there, the returns people are getting are really surprising. Why is that exactly so in other words, because they're such demand and that rates are still low enough to make your cost of capital still pretty good. And so one day was a shyness in the market. People were slow to respond to investment real estate. Now everybody's jumping into it, but it kind of lag behind all of the kinds of investments. So you had a little rest period. Secondly, the rents have been going up nationally. And if you choose your properties carefully, like if you're investing, say in Orlando, rents are up almost 30% crazy. And you can make sure what that does to the bottom line. And very importantly, which we all take for granted, like our right to breathe money so cheap. And so you could leverage really high. So so I even in New York City, which has gone through a really tough period because of all the changes. Albany that make it really almost untenable to make money here as an investor. And so people have stopped buying, they've moved them money elsewhere. And there's so many opportunities to buy and get very good returns because rents keep going up. Yeah, I want to drill down some of those specific markets for wherever you mentioned Orlando is hot New York is problematic. What are some other areas that are either hot or cold or things are catching your eye? Well, I should have a chart in front of me because I keep a chart and I can't remember what order they are. But you have a Houston is a very vibrant market and rentals and prices on investment real estate is still not catching up to it from what I could see. Pittsburgh is mind boggling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,45,2022-10-11 17:06:55
3034," Houston is a very vibrant market in rentals and prices on investment real estate is still not catching up to it from what I could see. You see Pittsburgh is mind boggling. Pittsburgh is probably where I've really put more of my money in the last two years and anywhere else. And the reason for it is people didn't take it seriously. It's not considered a major city. But there's been so much technology that has moved in there. It's got the most educated populations. It's got a friendly government that loves development. They have no rent restrictions or in control. So it's almost like a cowboy land. You could really gallop out of the gate and make money right from the get go. And that's exactly what I'm happy. I shouldn't even say it because I don't want any competition. But now everybody is discovering it. But the minor cities pretty much with, I don't forget which city just announced ring control boy I backed out of that so fast. But most of the secondary cities are doing very very well. You almost got a dark board. Throw the dart there. Be OK. You got the Steelers to what about New York City? I mean, we're talking about, you know, an extreme luxury market. What are the dynamics going on in here in the big apple? I am telling you that super duper luxury market has totally changed, particularly over the last three months. If you're a really wealthy person, you want to make a statement and get a trophy property. You'll be competing with a bunch of other giant egos with a fatter wall at the new half, right? The super luxury market is suddenly a shortage of listings. I never thought a year ago, I would say that. But there's overbidding on new development sites. On the upper side, there's one building that's going as a starting point 20% over asked for the date open the door two months ago. Make no sense. It was over price to be with the now it's going 20% over as the developers celebrating the luxury market. I can't imagine stopping and the new developments, although I see cranes all over town, just can't keep up with the demand. That's right. The top end. That's a top end. You know, what about the middle line? Everything else. Well, the middle in New York today is get a three to five million dollar apartment in middle class, right? The middle market is a shortage of listings. If you're in a co-op, they don't sell nearly as well. So if you have a condominium, just because it's such a preference for the condo product over the co-op, particularly in the last two years, don't really why that's changed. And if you're looking for a small piet of tear for your kid that's going to NY, you forget about it. You might as well just keep them at home and lock them up. It's just to damn expensive. Real surprises of those units are going up like 20%. And if you want to rent something, I know I own a lot of rental billings in New York where I have a lot of those type of rich kids, the parents guarantee the least, which makes you feel really cozy at night. But those rents, you, I mean, it's a bidding war on every single apartment, no matter how high you price it when it comes to market. And just it Hudson Yars doing okay, that things getting filled up now. It's working on it. Don't ask me about Hudson Yars because I don't want to do the many damage, but it's not my cup of tea, so to speak. It's a big project over there. Let's just be a big project over there. Yes. Right. Exactly. And what about the future against sort of broadening out nationally, Barbara? What's in store? I mean, is it so just completely rate dependent? It's rate helped. If interest rates, I forget how much they've gone up in since December, like, what is it? Three quarters of a point to their about I think it's it's helped by rate. Okay. That she is helped by cheap rates. If a rate, if the rates go up by one point, you buy less house, you have to cut your budget down a bit while rent prices of pardon me, while house prices are skyrocketing at the same time. So it eliminates more buyers, but I'm not afraid of that. I almost hate to wish it, but it's almost like we need it. We need to comment down, cool it off. But if rates go up by 2%, well, the bottom full out of the market will houses not sell no because it's such a shortage. But does it make fewer buyers compete for those houses most definitely? And so rates rates are always in partnership with real estate. I mean, that's like the foundation of real estate. Can I borrow the money cheap? Well, it doesn't sound like you're that scared of Jay Powell, that right? No, I'm not so I'm not so scared. All right. Shifting gears a little bit. Crypto Bitcoin.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,46,2022-10-11 17:11:43
3035," Hey, pal, that right? No, I'm not so I'm not so scared. All right, shifting gears a little bit. Crypto Bitcoin. I think you said it would be perfect for real estate transactions. Why do you think that is and you really think that could be a routine way for people to pay for real estate? You know, there's a lot of money passed under the table on high end real estate that people don't know about, you know, what you see as a sales record is sometimes not very sometimes just not really what really which really transacted and that's very clumsy to do and difficult to do. I know crypto currencies because of because of the nature of what they are people would feel comfortable. It would help high end real estate particularly. So I think I don't see why not it's efficient. People believe in it. People are trusting it and I just don't see why that wouldn't become not the norm by any means for the average person but a big piece of the real estate market. Yeah, I do. You guys seen any of that yet actually in your business. We have seen three apartments trade that I know of is this probably much one that I know we've seen three apartments trading the last two years with cryptocurrency. Well, all right, it's coming okay, and then how about even beyond that bar I'm talking about the metaverse. And real estate. you you you you you r U U U N V U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U T U U T U U What do you think the likelihood that a metaverse real estate investment would pay off down the line? I think, and you know, this is all guesswork. Even people who claim they know what they do are not believe and everybody is just guessing. But if you want to want to add my guesses to the pile, I think the greatest potential in the real estate space in the metaverse certainly is retail and commercial retail because it's being halfway done already that some of these high price brands like Gucci, Lovetown are selling virtual closing as an FTs and there's a large appetite for it. They're buying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,47,2022-10-11 17:15:34
3036," that some of these high price brands like Gucci, Loveton are selling virtual clothing as an FTs. And there's a large appetite for it. They're buying. So of course, we need the bridge between the actual clothing that I could see with when I go to the little the little mall I could hold a person my hand, I could buy it actually ordered. That's not far away. So assuming that really happens, that marries, and I don't see why it wouldn't really, I think retail. It could be the best thing that ever, that metaverse could be the best thing that ever happened to retail. I must say so. I also think that the ability to meet with the people that work with you, or people who ability to meet with anyone in the metaverse, makes the commercial sector very juicy. I really believe that people will do more of business in the metaverse in terms of meeting up. And so that makes commercial space very valuable. I think the question has to be answered is what makes one space more valuable than the other? And why would I pay that and not that? And that's, I think that's going to all come out in the wash over the next couple of years. Certainly, I know it's a odd example, but with Snoop Dogg offering parcels right next to our house. I took that very seriously, because suddenly there was a differentiation between one lot and another that someone was willing to pay so much to be next to celebrity. Now with the celebrity, they're going to do concerts and entertainment. That's a natural for the metaverse. So you might say, well, that's not true of all real estate, but there's a proof of concept that people will bid high and pay a lot of money to be near something else. And that's what real estate is like in our universe. So I see that as filled with potential that one example. I don't put much credence in the fact that Morgan Guarantee now has what do they have the lounge thing? I just see that as extension of their chimneys, the ego there because you get to see a real live tiger when you walk through his face and then you see a great portrait of the head of the bank. Wow, I really want to buy next to that. Okay, but that's just, I think that's just stealing the headlines that good PR stunt, you know, but I do pay attention to Snoop Dogg most seriously because that is proof of concept. Any big regrets from Shark Tank investing regrets that is? Yeah, I regret the first two years I invested in Shark Tank because I was trying to figure out which businesses were good. In businesses that I had no knowledge of, I know real estate, that's it. But I was trying to figure out, ah, this is a good business. When I finally threw that away on year three, I started making the right choices by just focusing on the entrepreneur. It made it also simple. So I wasted two good years and trying to be who I wasn't, I wasted those two years feeling insecure and second guessing myself. It wasn't any fun. It's only when you're comfortable in your space and you trust in yourself, do you start to have fun? So yeah, I'd rewind and get rid of those first two years away. I was managing them. Hey, do you ever invest in the stock market and in equities and if so or maybe even not if so, what do you like? What do you not? Like what do you think about? I do not and let me tell you why I don't because I like to know what I'm doing. I love control. I invest in real estate. I could smell it. I could feel that I know what I'm doing and I make money. Now, any financial advisor that I've ever talked to said it's not wise to have all my equity in real estate, real estate of this kind and that kind. I listen and I'm sure they're right in theory, but in actuality, they're not right for me. I'm right for me. I know how to do that well and so I stick with my knitting. Let me ask you about celebrity CEOs and, well, Barbara, you might kind of be one, but I'm really talking about, well, I'm talking about you, I guess a little bit, but Elon Musk and his tweeting and Warren Buffett and Zuckerberg are celebrity CEOs good for business and what can be learned from from different models of being a high profile person like that? Depends who you're talking about and our doesn't it? Elon, you mentioned him. He doesn't want people to pay as much attention to his tweets and what's he tweeting for? Of course, he does. Okay. His personal tweets control the value of his business, his personal demeanor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,48,2022-10-11 17:19:58
3037," and to his tweets and what's he tweeting for? Of course he does, okay? His personal tweets control the value of his business. His personal demeanor and the way he looks and acts and says kind of a little bit of a wild man, right? People love him. People love him. If you could get your audience to love you, your stock does better. So simple as that. What a great high profile CEO does for a firm is they A, get attention, which is very important, especially when the business is young. And B, they get the right attention if it's a love affair. And people will buy with their heart and justify with their head in that order. I believe in anything. I've learned that my years in business. So people will buy into him and they'll justify that that stock is gonna be amazing. And guess what, they're right because of enough people feel that way the stock keeps rising. Take a Mark Zuckerberg by comparison, okay? Mark Zuckerberg, I always pronounce his name wrong. Mark Zuckerberg, somebody's gotta tell me how to pronounce his name. Dr. Berg. Won't give it to me again. My office says this all day long. What is it? Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg. Yeah, Zuckerberg. Can you hear that? What I just said. How did that? Okay, he's smart and people respond to him, like wow, he was young, so smart, so rich. But unfortunately, he's also sneaky and robotic. And so people don't trust him, like him. Isn't that sad? I don't know if he's trustworthy. I don't know. I don't know a thing about that piece of him. But I can tell you something. Does that work against his value for his business? Yes, it does. It really does, because it's not likeable. All right, take somebody like Jeff Bezos. You know what I thought? When I saw that he lost all that weight and must have had a great personal trainer looking buff and gotta himself a young wife. I thought to myself, good for his stock. Maybe not, but he looks like a guy who looks like a winner when I see him in the pages of the papers. You see, so I don't think you can underestimate the power that a celebrity head can bring to a firm or the damage it could do when it's a wrong messaging. But I think today it's almost essential. I don't think it's an extra. You know, there was a time when we didn't elect celebrities for the highest office in our country, but we have found recently that that's a pretty darn good calling card, you know, same with business. I think things have changed. It's all about marketing, branding, and who puts a face on a brand better than the face? Right. It's essential. I want to ask you a little bit about, well, I guess maybe inequality in our economy and whether or not the deck has stacked increasingly against a little guy in terms of people wanting to start businesses, tech is so big. Rich people are getting richer. Is it that much harder now, Barbara, for someone to start a small business? I don't believe it's harder for someone to start a small business harder to maybe to get the hands on the money, but that's always been hard. And the great majority of the small businesses started in America, don't borrow money. They, you know, they work it off, so to speak. Like I did like so many small businesses did. But is there an inequality, which is your larger question across the board? Of course there is. I've never seen a less balanced America than we're seeing right now. Does a little guy have the same shot they had 10 years ago for anything? No. I mean, do they even have the same shot versus a year ago, no, with inflation doing what it's doing? They get a 3% raise and then inflation goes up 5% so that their money buys less to feed their family. I mean, they re, the lower price the worker in America, the shorter into the stick and the shorter the stick gets. I, I re end for the wealthier people in America. Everybody, I know seems to be making money. I mean, everyone I know who owns businesses through COVID made more money. I really mean it. I have many very well healed friends and they were complaining all the way to the bank. But that's not true of the people, the moms that were staying at home, mining their kids and gave up the second income because the kids couldn't go to school. There is such a breach between the rich and the poor in America that frightens me. I think about it a lot. I should have a solution. I do not at all. But I think about it a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,49,2022-10-11 17:24:42
3038," between the rich and the poor in America, it frightens me. I think about it a lot. I should have a solution, I do not at all, but I think about it a lot. I think it's very troubling, yes. Yeah, I was gonna ask you if you had any ideas. I mean, one thing is obviously higher taxes and everyone's all up in arms about that, but it is a difficult problem to solve, right? If it wasn't, it would have been solved a while ago. Certainly people are concerned about it. I've talked about it a heck of a long time. As long as I can remember talking myself, it's a difficult problem, so yeah. Let me ask you a little bit about you, Barbara. You grew up in New Jersey. I think you were the second oldest in a family of 10 siblings, is that right? Yeah, that's right. It's a good position actually in a family. Oh, well, I'm talking about that. You talked about the competition for attention from your parents. How do you think that experience formed you? So totally for me, in my family, most of the kids are all entrepreneurs. They are entrepreneurs for one reason. My father was a working man, worked two jobs his whole life and came home and told us how much he hated his boss and quit and got fired and quit and got fired. We all grew up not consciously thinking we wanna be in charge of ourselves, but we are. That was very important. In terms of getting attention, I'm very good at marketing. That comes from being one of 10. I know I had to learn how to speak up, interrupt, and be faster on my feet than the other nine if I was to get my mother's attention because it was spread among 10 kids on my dad's attention. So when you're in a big family, you know, how to get attention, you will somehow how to compete. But the greatest thing, and I'm not stereotyping about all large families, but large families that are led by loving powerful parents. For those kids, they're the luckiest kids in the world because you know what it's like really? It's like growing up in a small...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,50,2022-10-11 17:28:22
3039," large families that are led by loving, powerful parents, for those kids. They're the luckiest kids in the world because you know what it's like really, it's like growing up in a small town. It doesn't feel like a family. Everybody's got a role. Everybody has a gift. Everybody's demonstrating the gift. You don't get a free ride. You're not helped out, but along the way you get the confidence that you're fine and will do well in life. So we all walked out of that household 18. I mean, none of us were worried about doing well for ourselves. It was embedded in our DNA by our parents who believed we could and we were well equipped with the various traits we had developed. Being in that large family with no money needed to go around and helping out, we all had jobs. I had 22 jobs before I started my real estate business. All of us worked from the time we were 11. Plot time jobs, babysitting, you know, at the kitty pool. Whatever we could get our hands on because we contributed to the household. So we are well equipped for living in a real estate. Right. And you began the real estate career. 20s, you sold it I think for what, 66 million in 2001. Yes. What was the key to building that business, Barbara? Talent. Talent choosing the right people because you have to remember when you have any unbusiness don't wants to work for you. And you don't have the means to buy people. You have to hustle somehow to get some willing souls to come work for you. And so hiring the right people and then the second part is developing their loyalty so they love you and that's easy, easy for me. You just love them really hard and they love you back. It's automatic. That's how you build a business. I mean, that was really my great talent is the right people and knowing how to build a team for sure and getting them so that they would like jump off a cliff for me. And they would because I would have jumped off a cliff for them. And so it was a mutual love affair. That's what built the coming later years I was able to build the coming much faster because I realized I had a gift for marketing. I could make something small, look very big and get everybody to write about it. That's the bullshit factor that you learn in a large family going back to that because you have to be very entertaining to get attention. But those are really the only two gifts I had. But I was able to choose all the right people around me that had all the other many things that I needed to build a big business. And I always had the right people. And finally Barbara, I mean, today you co-host the TV show, podcast speeches, you get some endorsements, you have all manner of projects. What is it that you consider important right now in your life and then even looking ahead your legacy going forward? Well, I don't care about legacy because I'll be dead. So what do I care about? But so far as what's important, I think of pretty much what winds up being important at all of us. I just really want to make a difference. However, I do it. I feel like I make a difference talking to the individual people that call on an 888 Barbara. I think I'm really good at giving advice because I can size up the situation, the person and give them the right advice. And so I do very well with my business unusual podcast, simply because people recognize it as valuable. And I feel really, really good about it. I get so much satisfaction out of helping my businesses that I've invested in, not because I'm making money, although that helps a lot, I find after a few years. But I love seeing someone with a dream and thinking I'm part of getting them to that dream. It's like being a fairy godmother. How many people get to play that in life, right? And so that is again another form of helping someone. So anything that I feel like I helped someone, I seem to make money right away. And I seem to get a lot of love back. So I feel very fulfilled and not empty handed as I get older and older close to that great. All right. That is the one and only Barbara Corcoran. Barbara, thank you so much for your time. My pleasure. Nice hanging out with you. You've been watching Influencers. I'm Andy Sirworth. We'll see you next time.

Guys, coming up, we're going to do a quick check of the markets. Coming next. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. Let's get a quick check of the markets here. And it's very simple analysis. Stocks are down. They are not up as traders ultimately await that CPI index read later in the week, which could come in hot and perhaps put further pressure on stocks. But let's stay on the stock market here more broadly. The Dow Jones industrial average is often seen as the most commonly used metrics for stocks, but the average US households. And it would appear that households are taking interest in the market again as the year winds down. Google searches for Dow Jones have picked up over the last month according to the folks at DataTrack Research. And my friend and former Boston Kramer tweeted a good point to me on this chart today. Maybe people are just fed up with the bear market and are looking to sell, sell, sell. Only time will in fact tell if that is correct. Coming up, Amazon Prime Day is back.

3041,"ced Welcome back to Yowl Finance. I'm Brian Sausie here with Brad Smith. We'll hear from Julie Heim and Shirley live from the Grinch economic forum. Our markets are back in a bad mood ahead of Thursday's important consumer price index reading ongoing weakness in European and Asian markets. We're also seeing that way on sentiment as well. Right now all three major indices are in the red. Here's what's on tap for this hour. These Amazon stock primes for gains. Amazon Prime Day 2 is in full effect today. We'll check in with one analyst to see if the spending event will boost Amazon's beat up stock price. And Wall Street out in force pre-earnings. We've got the details on a bullish new call on Chipotle and a less than happy call on Zoom. And chatting with Wales, our Julie Heim will speak with Churchill asset management founder and CEO Ken Kencel from the always high end event known as the Green and Green and Credit economic forum. But first, Brad, let's get over to you at the Yowl Finance Interactive for a look at all things markets. Yeah, thanks so much, Sausie. Well, just putting a little more context into today's decline. There you saw at about the 10 a.m. hour we bounced off of some of the intraday session lows for the Dow Jones industrial average as of right now, we're still lower by about 3 tens of a percent though. Taking a look at the NASDAQ composite, you're also seeing that lower by about 1.5% here intraday and still in the same ballpark of some of those early session lows as we're just about 37 minutes into today's trading activity here on this Tuesday. The S&P 500, that too, down a little more than 1%. Taking a look though, a little further into some of the travel names that we've been tracking. It's really only one bright spot and it's barely holding on to some of those gains that had come as a result of an update that from American Airlines. It's holding on to gains by the hair of its chin to chin to chin right now. That compared to being up by 4% pre-market and so now you're seeing some of that sputtering out but continue to watch this broader travel and kind of reopening play if you will because even though some of the demand that the airlines have cited as being strong, even though some of that demand persists and the taking price from and in the midst of this kind of higher demand, taking price to consumers and having consumers still accept that, even though that's locked into place, it's still a question of what the capacity will look like for them. That's something that American had talked about and now you're seeing AAL dip into the red but more broadly continue to watch Airbnb. That's down by about 6% here on the day. Some of the other travel names that are declining, EXPE, Expedia, also move lower by a little more than nearly 4%. Shifting gears and watching shares of Amazon though, as they kick off their second prime day event, shares are lower by about 2.5% right now.

3042," Their second prime day event shares are lower by about 2.5% right now. What our next guest calls bridging the gap between the back to school and the holiday shopping periods for more on prime day. We welcome in, Cowan managing director and senior analyst covering internet and new media. John Blackledge, John, great to have you here. Happy prime day sequel to you, I suppose, as we kick off the holiday season sales even earlier. And it always gets earlier and earlier and there's more names that even get looped in to this broader sales blitz, if you will. How do you expect this to pan out for Amazon knowing that so much of the e-commerce push that they have? This is just going to be a larger break even type of push that they're looking for in order to just get rid of some of this inventory and perhaps get some new signups on the prime front. Yeah, you know, it kicks out, so it kicks off the holiday season for the company. Remember last year, it was an earlier holiday season with the, with the supply chain issues. This year, it's a little bit different, right? I mean, more macro headwinds for the consumer. So it'll be interesting to see how the consumer holds up throughout it. But you have, like you just said, the in stock levels are good. Arguably, there's a glut of inventory across across the retail landscape, which could lead to kind of higher discounting than previous holiday seasons. But I think for Amazon, a couple of things in stock levels are good and their delivery speeds are back at pre-pandemic levels. That's what they told us at two queue earnings. And that should only really improve for the company. Remember, Amazon invested about $80 billion in their fulfillment and logistics infrastructure since 2020. That included quadrupling their last amount of delivery stations. So outside of this prime early access event or second prime day, we think these faster delivery speeds will drive higher conversion rates, which should go well for the company throughout the holiday season. John, some estimates out there in the street are suggesting Amazon from this day might pull in over $4 billion in sales. It might be another big day for them. Yet the stock continues to be under pressure. We're seeing it down here today. What is holding back Amazon stock at this point? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I think broadly, Internet is kind of down today at varying levels. But to your point, remember in July, the July prime day event, we estimated they generated about $7 billion in revenue. And that was about $5 billion incremental to what they would normally do during two days in July. So we think this will be a big event for the company over the next two days. And remember, the July prime day event led to the strong three-tube guidance. And for the company for this year, they didn't have a second prime event right last year. So they're going to report earnings in a couple of weeks. They're going to have this effectively the second prime day for their 4Q guide. And we're looking for about 12% e-commerce growth in 4Q. And overall revenue, when they guide to it in a couple of weeks, we're looking, we're about a percent and a half above the street. So we are looking for pretty robust growth. And remember, Amazon, despite the stock price today and thus far this year, there are a couple of good things going on. You have revenue growth re-excelerating, both in 3Q and in 4Q versus flat in the first half of the year. And they are pulling out of this massive historic investment cycle, which usually builds well for the stock. So we'll have to see, I know it's a shopping market and tougher internet, but there are good things going on fundamentally at the company. We're taking a look at some of the comparisons in terms of the stock performance, Amazon versus Walmart versus Target. You could easily throw Best Buy into the mix too if you wanted to. There's so many brands that have tried to take advantage as tertiary players or secondary options, I should say, when we do have a massive sales blitz like this ahead of the holiday season, but are all sales or promotional cycles created equal from your perspective? Oh, yeah. You know, and I can't totally speak to what the other players are doing. You usually do see other players around, typically around prime days doing things. And also, Amazon does a lot of things in the lead up to prime days. Like even I think small businesses like for the July event generated about 3 billion in revenue in the three week lead up to the July prime day. So, but I think, you know, kind of as we're talking about, I think this will kind of kick off the holiday season, not only for Amazon, but for other retailers. And we will see like I was saying earlier.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,54,2022-10-11 17:46:02
3043," But I think, you know, kind of as we're talking about, I think this will kind of kick off the holiday season, not only for Amazon, but for other retailers. And we will see, like I was saying earlier, if it's going to be an earlier holiday season this year and where the consumer is, you know, just giving all these macro headlines. Count Analyst John Blackledge, always great to get some time with you. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Before I head to break, let's take a look at this market, Stanley Downgrade on Shares of Zoom. The analyst, Meta Marshall, says the team is stepping to the sidelines on Zoom as there are no near term catalyst for the stock. The online business isn't expected to stabilize until early next year, suggesting an overhang is likely to stay over the next stock for the next six months. Marshall's price target on Zoom goes to $90 from $130. Zoom shares are down about 61% so far on this year.

And be real, the filter free social media company gaining popularity among Gen Z. Top 53 million worldwide installs across both Google and Apple's App Store. Meanwhile, monthly active users are up over 2000 percent according to sensor tower. But only 9 percent of its active Android installs are opening the app every day, far behind Instagram and TikTok. Still, many of the apps, new installs, they're from young people in the US where Apple's iOS is the perforged platform. Sounds? Oh filters. Interesting. All right, gas prices are on the rise again here in the US. After OPEC Plus, slash its output target by 2 million barrels a day. Now President Biden is re-evaluating the nation's relationship with Saudi Arabia. You know, if I can see your comments, Rick Newman has the latest. Rick, interesting to see how this relationship has evolved and may continue to evolve. Yeah, Saudi Arabia, not such an ally anymore, basically rebuffing Biden in his request to pump more oil. But when you hear that Biden is re-evaluating the relationship with Saudi Arabia, it's hard to figure out what actually might change. And I don't think people should expect much to actually change at least not anytime soon, not before the midterm elections. But people are angry. I mean, just going around, I've found that I'm talking with friends and other people and they're like, what is wrong with OPEC? Why are they citing with Russia, basically, and trying to push up the price of oil, which is going to just give Russia more energy revenue to fight its war with Ukraine? I don't think that's exactly what's going on. But, you know, people are pissed off here in the United States and you're hearing some people in Congress say we got to do something about this. So, not entirely clear what we can do. There are some ideas out there. My guess is not much is actually going to change. Gas prices have come down, but they're still high. Is that still top of mind amongst voters as we look to them in terms? Heck yeah. I mean, we figured out this year that consumer confidence basically goes up and down based on gas prices. Nothing seems to drive consumer confidence more than gas prices just because they're so visible. So, where are gas prices right now? We're looking at about 392 today. Now, oil prices, which are the main component of gas prices, did go up after OPEC said they were going to cut production. Remember, that was a long-term production cut. It wasn't like anything changed in today's inventories. But then, oil prices came back down. They did not go quite as high as some people thought. To figure out where gas prices are going, I look at wholesale gas-linked prices. Anybody can do this on Yahoo Finance. The ticker symbol is RBOB. That's wholesale gasoline. And those prices have actually come down during the last few days. So, we may see 392 come down to, I don't know, 385. I think if you're in the Biden White House and you're thinking about the midterm elections, you want most people to see a price that starts with a three, rather than a four. And I think Biden might get that for the next three weeks. What's that lead gas on for? I think it's on the black market. Yeah, I might need it this year. Yeah, I think you're the only guy you might have a car that takes that off. Let's take that off, library. The trend, damn. You're the man. I'll talk to you. We'll talk to you soon.

3045," Welcome to Timets. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. I'm going to do a little bit more. A choppy economy is seeing investor attention shift to private and debt markets. Joining us from the Greenwich Economic Forum in Connecticut, let's get back to our very own Julie Heimann, who is there with the special guest, Julie. Thanks so much, with me is Ken Kenselli, president and CEO of Churchill Asset Management, which has an enormous credit portfolio. And so, can give us a good read on what is going on in companies at this time of rising interest rates. Ken, thanks for being here. Thanks for joining us. So, obviously, we have been hearing about a lot of gloom lately, right? Some commentary from Jamie Dyer yesterday, the IMF cutting its growth forecast for the next several years. What are you hearing from your portfolio companies? And are you guys sort of getting more stringent in some of your credit standards right now? Sure, no, great question. Great to see you here. Look, I think, as we go through the challenging economic dynamic that we're seeing, obviously, we are being more conservative about our lending standards and companies that we look to finance and invest in. But that being said, if you look at our portfolio today, we have about 41 billion in capital and management. We have about 400, actually 450 portfolio companies all across the US, all US, mid-sized businesses. And what we're seeing, frankly, is that those companies, by and large, are actually quite healthy and growing and actually performing quite well. So, you know, I understand there's a lot of doom and gloom in the air, but the reality is that if you're financing high-quality companies and businesses and being very careful about the businesses that you finance and invest in, and you apply, you know, a very high standard, there are still some very fantastic businesses to finance and invest in, particularly ones that have benefited from COVID-19, you know, either through technology or logistics. And so, that's where we focus. We tend to focus on software, business services, healthcare, distribution, logistics, businesses that have generally benefited from COVID. And so, today our portfolios and quite good shape. Deal flow remains in the middle market for the better companies, quite robust. I would say for the more challenged businesses, those companies are kind of off the market, if you will, right now. They're not really being, you know, transacted. But I think for the better businesses, there are still opportunities to finance and we're certainly seeing that. Well, let me ask you then on the fringes, right? Because I think back to the financial crisis and going into it, things look much the same. And I'm not saying that this is the same. What I'm asking for about is, are there signs on the fringes of things at higher risk levels that we should be watching? So, I would say certainly for the companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,57,2022-10-11 17:58:54
3046," that we should be watching. Yes. So I would say certainly for the companies or deals that were done at levels that now would be considered excessive or kind of beyond reasonable businesses that frankly may have yielded slightly more in return, but obviously brought with that return a lot more risk. And so I would say that you'll start to see cracks along those lines, businesses for example that have real issues passing on price increases to their customers, right? So as cost rise, can they actually roll those expenses back to their customers, whether those are retail or commercial? But I will say that there is certainly an expectation that 23 is going to be a more challenging time as we move through this credit cycle. I continue to believe that it will be relatively short. I think that when I compare this for example to the GFC and we did manage capital through the GFC that this is not the same as the GFC and a lot of the fundamental cracks that we saw in the GFC, particularly the mortgage market and some of the issues with the banks. We're just not seeing that today. So will we be in for a modest recession? I think that's becoming increasingly clear. We will. The Fed seems intent on doing that regardless of the consequences, which I think is trying to be prudent relative to the inflation threat. But I think at the end of the day, we're not looking at a two year downturn. We're looking at a shorter term impact. But it will impact those businesses that were maybe looked pretty attractive at the margin a year ago. Right. G, we're getting 10% for a senior secured loan. Well, there's a reason. No, not so much. So I think that's the thing to look for. I'm Ray Delio spoke earlier and he talked about America being in decline. And you, when it was your turn to speak, really push back against that notion and we are, you are what one would call a self-made man, right? And so why don't you think that America is in decline? Well, first of all, if you look at the purported competing dynamics, the competing cultures are competing models, right? I think about the American model and I think that if you look at the challenges that we've seen over the last century, right? I think about a communist system or a socialist system. And I think I believe very strongly that the US is the place in the world that has been for centuries now where it provides economic opportunity, upward mobility. I'm a big believer in that. I'm on the board of Teach for America, Connecticut. And I think that we are still the best place to raise a family to build a business and to pursue your dreams. So I'm fundamentally an optimist and I'm sticking to it. I like it. I like the optimism. Are we going to leave with our Ken Kensell of Churchill Caval asset management? Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thanks so much, really excellent conversation there. Everyone's switching gears here. Want to get to our calls of the day here today. Our Alka thing is off NFLX. I'm looking at Netflix. JP Morgan's tape is that it's advertising will bring in billions of dollars still making waves this morning. Now the bank retains a neutral rating with a $240 price target here. There you're taking a look at shares on the day. Of course, there's a broader base sell off, especially in tech as we've been tracking. But NFLX shares down by about 5.8%. They had actually seen much of that kind of move higher be priced in, intraday yesterday. And so now it's a question of even with this kind of bullish perspective that they have, where some of the other bearish takes on the street are starting to pour in that as well. I could actually mention one earlier today here. That particularly coming out and saying that Netflix shares have caught a relative bid post week. 2Q resulting guidance and optimism. However, in the end, this is not rocket science. They're moved to launch an ad supported alternative is this fraught with ARPU, RPU, essentially that average revenue per user, technological and financial product risk. That I believe had come out from, it was Jeffries earlier today. Pivotal. Pivotal. So, all of that, you're starting to have a healthy bull bear dialogue on this. Yeah, it's going to be a fun earnings report from Netflix in a couple weeks because you have all this optimism that Netflix shares up now about 15.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,58,2022-10-11 18:03:20
3047," you're starting to have a healthy bull bear dialogue on this. Yeah, it's going to be a fun earnings report from Netflix in a couple weeks because you have all this optimism. The Netflix shares up now about 15 or 16% in the three months on an ad service that doesn't even exist yet and that's no revenue. And then, oh yeah, you have to stay focused on what this company is going to report. And let me remind it folks, the past three quarters from Netflix have not been good. Sales have decelerated year over year for the past three quarters. Margins have been under pressure. People have become more mobile, have clicked out of Netflix or flat out canceled as prices have gone higher. So it's an interesting time, I think, to be involved with the Netflix story. The promise might be there, but again, near term, this is no longer the Netflix of old. It's just a matter of how many people, number one, opt into that ad tear. But then, additionally, the amount of advertising revenue that they actually realize from it going forward and the number of campaigns that make their way into Netflix versus a bundle, perhaps, that comes in the future, especially from a company in Disney that we know is also going to layer on some of their ad-supported ambitions as well here within this broader streaming landscape. All right, let's stay on tech here. I'm watching a good note, again, from Chris Daly, a city analyst, we frequently cite his work. I do at least because I think he's really on the pulse of this really great chip slowdown of 2022. Calling out some weakness and cancellations of orders over analog devices, apparently that has been hitting their results, but now he's seeing that spread, especially in Europe, over at the likes of NXP, semiconductor, and also Texas instruments. Now, Daly is just flat out calling this a downturn now hitting the analog chip space. Take this, you take weak results from AMD, you have that really disappointing quarter from Intel a couple months ago, and this could be a very, very challenging third quarter earnings season for chip players, not only because the results by themselves may not be good, but the guidance may be just absolutely brutal. Yeah, one of the only bright spots it seems at this point in time, at least for the broader chip segment, is, or maybe two of them, and one of them is years out from now, and that is kind of a multi-year multi-pronged approach in the number of places that are going to bring on capacity, whether that be geographically or whether that be companies that we're talking about, and the production once that begins to ramp up. So that's a long term. Near term, what just had a ton of investment over the course of the last two years, pull forward and demand, it's the data center businesses for a lot of the companies, even that we've talked about in citing some of the own near term headwinds that they do have, and if you see at least some churn in the number of chips that are in those data centers, and needing to upgrade those on a more regular basis, that's perhaps at least a catalyst for some stability, but then it's what's the growth potential going forward from there, and that's something that investors I believe are pricing in and has been rattled to a great extent at this point. Guys, coming up, investing in farmland. Yes, we're going to go to the heartlands and the farmlands. We're going to speak with the CEO of Acre Trader on the other side of this short break. Video Raw is ready.zh",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,59,2022-10-11 18:08:15
3048,"lass A software landing for investors as market sentiment moves to real estate and even investments in farmland, acre trade wants to provide a marketplace for analysis and insight on the land itself, helping buyers maximize their purchase decisions now through an online platform. acre trade CEO Carter Maloy joins us now. Carter, great to have you here with us in studio. Thanks. So walk us through the model, the platform, and how quickly someone could go from evaluating the land to investing in it as well. In a matter of minutes, so the second part there, so very quickly our team is really there to help them with evaluations. So we're about 150 people in total. Good portion of that is software engineers and data scientists supporting a lot of the decisioning. But ultimately, how it works is very simple. We're a platform for investors to gain access to farmland. Farmland has performed incredibly well historically. We haven't heard much about it because frankly you had to go out and plop down a million dollars and manage a farm. It's just not a thing most people could do. So that's where our platform acre trader comes in. We really help the individual come on and rather than investing in a million dollars, you can put in $10,000 in on a slice of a farm. What is that? What would that $10,000? If I had $10,000 right now, what would that get me and how do I analyze if that's a good investment? Yes, so it can get you anywhere from an acre to only a portion of an acre depending on the where you are within the U.S. or Australia where we primarily invest. The quality of that investment, each investment we put on the website has full detail describing. Here's why we believe this is an interesting investment. And here are the cons to each one of those as well with everything they do. What are the best farms? What should I invest? How do I identify a good farm? Most of the institutional portfolios seem to be about 60% row crops, so things like corn and soybeans and then 40% permanent crops, things that grow in trees, almonds, fruits, etc. What if I say I want to invest in wineland or kind of the vineyard country? Is that expansion into kind of new states, new countries even where there are different types of things being grown for regular produce or other types of products? How have you managed some of the demand or where customers are asking for that? Yeah, we do get a lot of customers that equate what's on their kitchen table to quality. Sure. Oh, if this makes wine, it must be a good investment. And then of course when they come learn a little more about that, it's like, actually, I think I want to own the boring corn, maybe this wine is not for me. Right, cow's can drink corn. Or cow's can drink wine rather. So it's more about what the stock is that you can actually get into some of the other parts of the broader operation in a farmland as well. That's correct. So the investor is buying a portion of this land, both, sorry, returns are generated two ways for that investor. One is through the cash incomes you're getting a revenue share alongside the farmer who's your partner in the deal or a cash lease. But actually more importantly, you're getting exposure to potential appreciation of that land underneath you. So whereas the coupon may be something similar to a money market today, that money market does not protect you from inflation. And the fact that it exposes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,60,2022-10-11 18:12:03
3049," and the magic is we need to be able to put in our product what then the people perceive something special because for people it's sort of all special today it's not about how much or how much as fancy is a product. And speaking of that alert among consumers, right now you're in LA for Golden Goose event, you're gonna have content creators there. We've seen the likes of Taylor Swift and Reese Witherspoon wear Golden Goose sneakers. How important has it been for influencers like those to wear your brand and ultimately drive to your success? It's a great question and I have a simple answer. What's magical is that we never place this product to be celebrities because Golden Goose is made in order to make everyone feel special. So the fact that every shoe is made, every shoe is unique, is making our customer become a lover and the fact that this celebrity has been wearing these has been just a great amplifier to a message that is simple and is not limited just for us more community, why is it really open to a wider community? What are we seeing in the style trends right now? I mean for Kanye West and Gap, it's been about some of the kind of more, I won't say basic or kind of dirty looks out there, but there is something that's out there to like making things look lived in already even before they sell. What is it with the trends right now that you're saying how much do you expect to kind of be able to lean further into that and where the customer is actually continuing to take price despite, hey, looks like a shoe has a scuff on it. What's up with that? Thank you Brian for this question because this is technically the first time that I'm answering to this question line to someone and it has been quite a question for a couple of years because you should remember that Golden Goose has been the first brand ever to be stressed for sneakers and at the beginning people will be like skeptical why do I have to spend 500 bucks for a pair of dirty shoe? While it was part of the magic again, Golden Goose never wanted to promote the product of now. We always want to know the people to talk about our product. So there was a space of an undefined space where the people were not really getting about that, but the reality is that simply what we try to do is to inject in life to our products to unleash the sense of uniqueness of every product we offer to our communities. And it's a little bit like you know your old device. It is always the most special because you really taking with it your memories. So every item that keep with you and keep with it, you know, his memories is then more special than something just because it's more extensive. So there's a new notion of going from product to purpose, product to values rather than just a product. So this is what is going on right now in the industry. And I think the example of Kanye is very interesting. Quite far from Golden Goose because Kanye is still, you know, quite fashion focused. Why Golden Goose is consumer obsessed? So this position Golden Goose in a very special angle of the industry. And speaking of just the long term goal of Golden Goose, you've been in this industry since 2000. You've been through three different investment groups here. Latest Premier took a majority stake in Golden Goose. So I have to ask here, there are also the owners of Doc Mardin's Valentino. Could we see Golden Goose go public in the near future? I mean, it's part of course, you know, of the options. And the most important to us where we may focus are two things. First, creating value every day to our consumers. Second to stay flexible because the market outside is very complicated and very complex. And as you can imagine, you know, consumers is really one of the first angles that the market and these difficulties and opportunities came with the reflected on. So it is very important in this process of education to stay flexible. Now, that's extremely important to bring up, especially in this conversation. And especially in this timing right now, given your kind of consumer base that you go after, the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the Golden Goose product, if you will, even with some of the anticipated recessionary concerns that many consumers have, are you seeing that show up in any of the sales figures and any of the relationship with that can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,61,2022-10-11 18:19:14
3050," anticipated recessionary concerns that many consumers have, are you seeing that show up in any of the sales figures and any of the relationship with that consumer right now? It's a great question. So as you can imagine for sure you know that almost 42, 44% of our businesses are driven by americans and so you know I'm a really special angle to be any time and brand because now we really many time and brands have the lucky that code and possess and I can tell you that on the American point of view we didn't see any recession last year we achieved something around 78% plus versus 2020 and this year we are in a zone of plus 40 versus next year versus last year in America. Any general the company the first semester has been performing like in creative but you know like last year why? Because again we don't really look at the trend in fashion we really look in trend in consumer and there's something that is for sure the KPI's that consumers look at are not a BIDA or no cash conversion is no revenues but are really like MPS customer acquisition is really the ability that the company and the brand has to retain and compensate with these communities so this is where Golden Goose is really representing an excellence and I really think that we are really representing a kind of new frontier for the consumer industry on this side. Really fascinating I've seen so many of your products on some of the high-end kind of fashion retailers and retailers out there as well and so I'm excited to see where the brand goes from here Golden Goose CEO Silvia Kampar joining us here today thanks so much for the time as well as Yahoo finances own Brooke DiPoma who's going to stick around for us here because we've got much more as President Biden has proposed a new rule that will make it more likely for millions of gig economy workers to be classified as employees Uber and Lyft and DoorDash all trading lower on this news Yahoo finances Brooke DiPoma sticking around with us for this conversation that's right so this new labor law will allow protection of workers basic rights make it easier for employers to properly classify their workers and also protect independent businesses that follow the law of course that's out from the U.S. Department of Labor this morning. Companies now expected to provide certain benefits to full-time employees and not to contractors of course that includes minimum wage over time apportion of workers social security taxes and contributions to unemployment insurance but here in a tweet from U.S. Secretary he says that misclassification hurts workers by denying them important benefits and basic rights like that minimum wage over time pay. It's a problem we often see in low-wage shops enforcing the rights of misclassified workers is a priority because these workers have so much stake of course this comes on the heels of the Supreme Court overturning Grovy Wade in earlier this summer and it also comes after 25 Democratic members of Congress led by Elizabeth Warren, Representative Bush, Accord Bush-Adish and Missouri, sent letters to CEO of Amazon lived, DoorDash and Grubb to question a policy that was a Trump error decision. Now of course Wall Street reacting to this shares lower on Uber-Lifted DoorDash, Dan Ives, a show favorite here calling this a clear blow to the gig economy and a near-term concern for the likes of Uber and Letz he also added that depending upon this model you could really overturn the likes of DoorDash, like Uber of course these customers or employees rather coming in doing their job here and there and then going not right now getting the full benefits of an employee. So lots more fallout to come from this decision and once again this is the second attempt of the Biden administration to overturn this. Yeah and you just see these harsh reactions notably with Lift there it's now this issue that is long-plague this this industry as well but this comes at a time as these companies finally start to achieve a little bit of profits if this changes if this goes against them and immediately immediately goes them brings them back to losing large sums of money. At a time where as well some of the prices that they had passed on in search charges for gas as well to consumers where that had started to at least on the gas price front started to come down in terms of the relation to the highest peaks that we had seen on an all-time basis earlier this year and so those search charges finally starting to come down but yet",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,62,2022-10-11 18:23:26
3051," come down in terms of the relation to the highest peaks that we had seen on an all-time basis earlier this year. And so those surcharges finally starting to come down, but yet this could also factor into the higher and elevated prices consumers are seeing on the economy front too. So we're going to be watching this very closely. Y'all find this is zone broke to palm breaking this down for us. Thanks, bro. And everyone coming up, Duncan, in some hot water over its rewards program, we've got this so done. Welcome back everyone. It's time for Cut to Time. We've got two stories today. One minute on the clock for each. We start with this. Dunkin. Dunkin is facing some backlash about its new rewards program. My goodness, the coffee giant announced a new program for customers acting the free birthday drink and changing their point system causing resentment from loyal customers like Brian Saussie. I'm upset, Brad. I'm upset. So I noticed my app changed over the weekend and it's going to take me I would I calculated $90. I'm spending $90 to get a free coffee from Dunkin. Right now I have 345 points which gets me two espresso shots. But ultimately don't take away my birthday drink. This is a tradition that Starbucks had Dunkin adopted. I need my free birthday drink. It's a right-of-pass. I spend enough money at these places. I want to be rewarded. I mean, even Nike still sends me updates. Every other brand that I buy with, I'm pretty sure Chipotle, Nike, like all of these companies, they'll give me that little update and say, hey, here's 20% off just because it's your birthday. And you're involved in all of these kind of reward systems so that you do get the birthday reward. $90 in coffee to get something free. It just don't seem right. All right, staying on food. Chipotle in focus after Bernstein initiated coverage with an outperform rating saying the chance customer strategy through apps like TikTok will prove to be a positive thing for shareholders. And I was checking out this Chipotle presence on TikTok. It is pretty, pretty darn impressive. 1.3. I think almost actually two million followers on TikTok. Some of the posts are great. But again, this fits, I think, very much with the Chipotle brand, which has always been focused on driving sales and engagement via social media. Now that you've taken that DNA of this brand and brought it to TikTok. Yeah, the Guacamole attachment rate is strong with this one here today as we're tracking shares. See, it's like the grill replacement, right? Well, I mean, I don't know. The grill replacement rate could be stronger if some of those grill start to crap out at Chipotle.

The grill replacement rate could be stronger if some of those grills start to crap out at your pole. So ultimately here, for Chipotle, what they have been able to do so well is, and yes, we're going to say it, menu innovation. KSO goes a far away when you're talking about burritos and changing out, pollo assado, and just having new types of meat offerings that you're able to throw onto the different bowls, the burritos, the tacos. I mean, the burrito was like 11 bucks when I was in college. Now, whatever. 15 here. All right, one programming note. Don't miss out.

I am very jazzed up about that one. All right, coming up in the next hour, Okiko Pajito will speak with IMF's chief economist on their latest economic report. They said this morning that the worst is yet to come. I can't wait to see that conversation. Okiko, do something. Let's see. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

3053," Moving ahead here, Stormy Waters ahead, the IMF downgrade that's growth outlook for the global economy as a fund warned of a harsh worldwide recession. Chief Economist Pierre Olivier Greenchuss is going to be joining us to break down the latest report later this hour. And doubling down on climate financing, the U.S. commits $950 million to accelerate the development of clean technology. We're going to talk to a senior specialist at the Climate Investment Fund to see how the group is planning to deploy all of that capital. As always, we are beginning with a market check, 90 minutes in to the trading day right now. As we pointed out, the only one in the green right now, and taking a look at where bond yields have been trading, we saw the 10-year start to move closer to that 4% level earlier today, and now we are seeing it at 3.9, the 30-year yield at 3.9 and the 5-year at 4%. We're beginning today, though, with a focus on the semiconductor sector today. Here's an interesting number to point out, $240 billion wiped out from the global chip sector. Global market value, we should say, since it's closed on Thursday, and we're talking about it, of course, because of those expert controls the U.S. has now put in. And that really has had global implications. We are continuing to see a sell-off in U.S. chip stocks. You see, in video, down to 1.5% Qualcomm seeing the biggest losses there, down about 4.7%. All of this, of course, as investors try to calculate their exposure to the Chinese market. A lot of this spilling over from what we saw over in the Asia session, particularly over in South Korea and Japan. A bit of a catch-up session there because they did have the Monday holiday off. Take a look at where those stocks, chip makers, ended up. We're talking about Reneces, which is a chip maker. Semi-conductor equipment maker, Tokyo Electron, also down and significantly. Over in South Korea, we did see Samsung and SK Heinigs, the biggest chip makers out there. Also down significantly, and then worth noting what we saw over with TSMC, of course, the largest chip maker globally, down significantly. We're talking about 7% right now. By the way, the sell-off was so significant what we saw there. And also, as so many of these countries and companies try to figure out the global implications, we have seen a move in currencies as well, the Korean one, down there, about 4.10% of a percent. So we're here to break it all down for you this morning, with Dan Halley, our very own chip expert here at Yahoo Finance. Dan, I just ran through so many different stocks we've been tracking over in Asia here in the US. By the way, we also didn't talk about ASMR over in Europe. How are you making sense of these latest expert controls that have been put in place that really came down on Friday, but there's still a lot of the market is still processing right now. Yeah, you talk about those companies that are overseas that had the holiday, SK Heinigs, Samsung, TSMC. You can see them kind of just dropping off as they kind of get back into things. But then you look at the likes of, let's say in video or Intel Qualcomm, they're all still being hit. You can see that came in on Monday, and you can look at stuff like applied materials, LEM research, KLA Corp. These are all companies that also took a hit. Those companies are about the manufacturing side of things. I think that's something that's important to look at. It's the manufacturing aspect as well as the overall technology. Applied materials, LEM research, KLA. They're talking about wafer manufacturing. Those are a problem there, and it'll be continuing to be a problem because those companies are providing the capabilities to companies in China to actually build the chips that they need. Then you look at the chip companies like SNK Heinigs, like Samsung, like TSMC that have actual factories out there in China. They're all getting hit, and I think that you're going to continue to see this, then obviously some American companies as well. When it comes to the AI side of things, Nvidia had taken a hit a while back when there was discussion of more export controls going into effect. They said that they were working with the Biden administration to try to figure out what they can do there. But obviously we're seeing them taking some damage now as well. Yeah, and we're sort of backing up to say, well, what exactly the ruling was in case people are just sort of catching up right now. One of the things that you want to do really means it would live in chip makers from semiconductors made with US technology. We're talking about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,65,2022-10-11 18:36:40
3054," What exactly the ruling was in case people are just sort of catching up right now. Number one, this new ruling means it would live in chip makers from semiconductors made with US technology. We're talking about the most advanced AI supercomputers. Also those US citizens would not be allowed to be a part about that. Which is why, yeah. Which is certainly key. And then of course, you wouldn't be able to use US equipment to manufacture these chips. And that's the thing that we often forget, right? So many of these companies, you've got global names out there, but many of them still use US equipment. If you are one of those, you would not be able to export to China. Yeah, I think that's the big thing that kind of gets lost is that the US is still the leader dominates the space when it comes to building actual chips. The companies that build chips or provide the materials to build chips, those are largely US companies. So if you take that out of the equation, it's a huge blow to China. It's a huge blow to these companies. Obviously, the discussion here is about whether or not the technologies will be fed into the Chinese military. And that's the big catch there. It's the same thing that we've been talking about for some time when it comes to technology in China. We saw this during the Trump administration, obviously seeing it during the Biden administration. But it'll continue to roll out. We just have to see how the other chip companies start to process this or if they can get some exceptions. And we're thinking really quickly that this isn't just about the regulation because this all comes out of time when we have seen a slowdown, whether it's demand in PCs, demanded other consumer electronics. That's another headwind working again, some of these chip makers, which is why we're seeing the pullback. Yeah, Gartner recently released yesterday released their latest note saying that worldwide PC shipments declined 19.5 percent in the third quarter. That's the worst decline in two decades. It's just pointing out, by the way, that it doesn't mean that the PC market is just going away. It's that we saw such explosive growth. That's just by showing the pants out. And now it's coming back to buy a computer every year. That's crazy. I mean, unless you're like me. But this is going to be an issue, I think, for at least three years before we start to see PC sales start to pick up again. Okay, just another narrative to add to the global tech space there. Thanks so much for that, Dan. Let's turn out to a look at the broader markets as investors gear up for result season. We have joining us now, SEMA Shah, principal asset management chief. Well, we'll strategist SEMA's here with us in studio today. It's good to talk to you today. It feels like we're finally able to pivot a little, if you will, looking at earning season with the big banks reporting later this week. But what do you have your eye on in terms of what's driving the market right now? So we continue to think, of course, about the Federal Reserve and what's going on that. Interestingly, we're getting a lot of questions about the dollar. How is that going to impact the rest of the world? And even could that influence Fed policy going forward, which as we have to say, we think that the Fed stays very much domestically focused. With regards to earning season, the thing that we have seen is this year, top-line earnings growth has been incredibly strong. It has managed to beat expectations time and time again. But we're getting towards the end of the year when you are expecting to see economic weakness start to seep in. But it probably won't start to show through until early 2023. So there could be another solid quarter. Yeah, in terms of the narratives we're expecting during earnings season, obviously a lot of similarities in terms of threads. FX had wins, a key one that we've been watching. Also, just where the consumer demand is right now. What are your biggest concerns? Well, I think the FX had one is an important one. You are seeing that companies which have a lot of international exposure. So those which are exposed to Europe, of course, China, emerging markets, they're struggling because their economies are also slowing a lot quicker. Throw on top of that the strong dollar policy, sorry, the strong dollar outlook. And of course, these companies are being additionally challenged. So their margins are being compressed further and further. So that's one thing they're watching. But also the consumer resilience is really interesting. And I think that what we're expecting to see is unless, until you see US labour market weakness, really start to get going. Actually the consumer could stay quite resilient. We know that there's a headwind coming, but it's not quite here yet. We're still a few weeks out from the next FOMC meeting. We had a New York Fed survey come out today pointing to inflation expectations, declining in the short term, but increasing in the medium and long term. We've got a CPI print coming out later this week, but...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,66,2022-10-11 18:41:03
3055," the day pointing to inflation expectations, declining in the short term but increasing in the medium and long term. We've got the CPI print coming out later this week but what is your read on where we are when it comes to inflation? We have still very, very far to go. We think we're hoping that we have seen peak inflation. The energy prices still are very much a wild card. We assume that they're going to keep coming down but as we've seen over the last week that's definitely not a guarantee. But even if that peak is behind us it's not enough really because we do think that the decline from here is going to be extremely slow. We can see that commodities, core transportation, those segments of inflation probably will turn deflationary. But as this stuff like shelter inflation, medical services, those parts which are very, very sticky and once they start to get going it's very difficult to contain them unless you can create economic weakness. So from the Federal Reserve's perspective they almost have to engineer a hard landing in order to contain inflation. So that means bringing the rates up further, keeping them high for pretty long, so higher for longer and only at that point can then we start to see some kind of relief on the inflation side. You said they have to engineer a hard landing, some still holding out hope that it won't be quite as severe but it sounds like you think that's a necessary step to get inflation back to where the central bank needs it. Exactly. I think a soft landing wouldn't be sufficient. I mean what the Fed needs to do is create labor market slack, increase labor supply, almost make things so difficult that households, people have to return to the labor market. And by doing that you reduce wage pressures but in so doing of course you make the economy, the economic conditions extremely challenging but this is your kind of price reset, this is your only way you're bringing down inflation. Has the pace of the rate high expense sufficient for you? I mean there's some that would argue that it's going too quickly. Yes, they need to hike rates to get the labor market in check but more importantly inflation as a whole in check. Are they moving too quickly? I would say they start off very slowly. I mean the fact that they started off with a 25 basis point hike in retrospect seems a little bit crazy. But at this stage I think they do need to be moved very quickly but they do of course risk the fact that given the lag from monetary policy to actually hitting real economy you do risk an even deeper slowdown than what they necessarily need to achieve. So it probably it could be slow down but of course you know when you have an inflation problem this serious it's important to get in front of it and really front load your rate hikes in order to make sure that the inflation problem just doesn't continue to grow. Really quickly a lot of people looking at their portfolios right now saying well what do I do in this environment? In terms of how much cash you set aside has that calculation shifted as a result of the volatility that we've seen? It's interesting actually because one of the I've been traveling around the US for the last week and the question we keep getting from clients is actually when are we going to be ready to put our money to work? Right so everyone is starting to look already to when does the market reach its floor and where do we go from there? So from that perspective it's really important to have that kind of liquidity in your portfolio so you're ready to deploy it as soon as those opportunities arise. So there is a concern about volatility so in the run up it means about playing defence going high qualities we do like long end treasuries even secure ties debt which has a better relationship within economic conditions and what you see with investment grade credit or even high yield credit. But really the opportunity set which is the best is still real assets. This is a high inflation low growth environment real assets can continue to perform well at that point. Okay a lot of people taking notes right there are similar to our principal asset management chief global strategist thanks so much for joining us today.

3056," Defeated in mind Defeated Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Let's check in on where the price of Bitcoin is moving right now. This is a $20,000 dollar handle. Earlier today, our team spoke with Galaxy Digital Founder, CEO Mike Novogratz. He had to say this about what Fed tightening means for the crypto space. Take a listen. It's hard to predict when these crypto winners how long they go. You know, we're a couple years from a having cycle. I do think the Fed flinching creates some enthusiasm around Bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin as a recession, as an inflation hedge, as a hard money when the rest of the world keeps printing money. Joining us to break down some of those comments. We've got our very own David, the holler at David, you're part of that conversation. Interesting that he said the Fed flinching could mean that crypto would be a little more attractive because that sort of was not the correlation just a month ago when we were talking about how far crypto had fallen. Right. That's a great point. Novogratz is obviously all seasons crypto bull. But to his point, the correlation changes between crypto currencies and stocks has been sort of interesting for the past two weeks. Sometimes this correlation breaks down and it just comes back immediately when there's a large Fed event or CPI or something like that. And obviously there's no Fed rate hike in October so that might be one reason why we're seeing sort of a breakdown. But to his point, the analysts I've spoken with have also suggested maybe reasons for why crypto...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,68,2022-10-11 18:50:35
3057," or of a breakdown. But to his point, the analyst I've spoken with have also suggested maybe reasons for a Y crypto might be holding up slightly better, at least since July. And the stock market has a lot to do with how much it is sold off in the previous quarter, the second quarter. So that's an explanation of that. But I mean, a great example to point to is actually coin basis own stock compared to the NASDAQ today. Coin basis has some news with Google. It's partnering with Google and it's going to use Google's cloud services. And in return, Google Cloud customers can pay with cryptocurrencies. And the parallel between the NASDAQ composite, not necessarily year-to-date, but over the last days sort of running in parallel to each other. So I think that our crypto is getting a little bit without so much macro data happening at least yet this week. It's getting a little bit of its own innovation narrative, which is coming back. Yeah, a big pop for Coinbase right there on the back of that news that stock up more than 4%. David Hollereth, as always, thanks so much for that. Well, a setback for the Biden administration as a union representing 12,000 rail world workers voted against the possible contract agreement between freight rail companies and the 12 unions raising concerns once again of a possible nationwide strike. Yahoo! Finance is Danny Romero and Rick Newman. Bubble them with me here at the desk today. Danny, let's start with you because you have been speaking to the unions directly. What's the very latest on where these talks stand? Yeah, so I spoke with Peter Kennedy. He is the chief negotiator and strategist. And he says that the main reason why the union did not ratify this tentative deal goes back to the lack of paid sick time. So there is a supplemental sick leave plan that is on the table. But that doesn't include, for example, if you're child get sick and you need to take that day off, it doesn't include in that. So again, there's a discrepancy between what the union wants and needs and what the presidential emergency board had put forward recommended for this deal. So, and in that deal, sorry, excuse me, it included a 24% wage increase and also $5,000 bonus and an additional paid sick day. But from what the union has been telling me is that they're going to schedule more discussions with the railroad carriers. And they'll have to wait and see. But it's seven more unions are expected to vote from now until November 20th. Rick, I'm thinking back to when the White House stepped in and it was sort of crisis averted. You get the sense, are we here we go again? I don't think so. So, crisis averted until the midterm elections, politically speaking, if this goes into, has to be resolved after the midterm, just not a political crisis anymore. And everything Danny just said, I mean, this sounds like small potatoes, honestly, based on all the concessions they've gotten so far, they've gotten a nice pay increase, better working conditions. So this sounds bridgeable, honestly. But I guess we might, in terms of the political conversation, we might hear Republicans saying, oh, President Biden failed to get this deal done. We could have higher prices because a strike would drive up the cost of everything that gets shipped by rail, which is a lot of stuff. But it's not going to happen before the midterm. So it's just really not a political story anymore, I don't think. Yeah, so much of this is framed in the context of the midterms were less than a month out. Danny, what's the sense right now in terms of the hard line that exists on these key sticking points, you just pointed out how long is this likely to drag out now? Well, like I said, there are scheduling more discussions with the railroad carriers. But the railroad carriers actually responded when the Union rejected this tentative deal. They said that they were disappointed. But this morning, the Union fired back and we actually have a sound bite. So just take a listen to what they had to say this morning. Frankly, we're disappointed that the railroads were not willing to engage in discussions that would have resulted in paid sick days, front members. So it's, the path goes both ways on this. So if the parties don't come to terms, then there could be a strike, but that strike wouldn't happen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,69,2022-10-11 18:53:55
3058," You know, it's, the path goes both ways on this, you know. So if the parties don't come to terms then there could be a strike, but that strike wouldn't happen until mid-Nobember. Five days after Congress goes back to session. Okay. Just what the administration wants to hear, right? I predict it's going to get settled. I predict there will be no strike. Okay. Well, I'll be watching. Rick and Danny, thanks so much for that. Coming up on the other side, two and a half trillion dollars in buying power. We discussed the reach of the Hispanic consumer and why addressing this key demographic should be a business priority. So it's coming up next.................... What is the final week of Hispanic Heritage Month? We're taking a look today at investing in the Latinx community. The fast growing group accounts for 19 percent of all Americans making it the nation's second largest racial group and a major opportunity for institutions. Joining us to discuss this, Joseon Fernandez, he's been recognized by Cranes, New York. As a notable leader in the Hispanic community, he's currently aerial investments head of national accounts. Joseon, it's good to talk to you today. We've seen those numbers in terms of the demographic makeup of this community. How should we be thinking about the returns of investing power and buying power? Thank you, Akiko. One of the biggest growth engines and arguably the biggest opportunity as you alluded to lies in our US Latino cohort. The US Latino demographic and have found that it's responsible for $2.8 trillion in GDP. $2.8 trillion in GDP. That's up $1 trillion and less than 10 years. We put that into perspective for your viewers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,70,2022-10-11 18:57:43
3059," $10 in GDP. That's up a trillion dollars and less than less than 10 years. So to put that into perspective for your viewers, if the U.S.-Latino cohort was its own independent country, be the fifth largest economy in the world, surpassing that of the United Kingdom, surpassing that of France, surpassing that of India, Canada, Korea, the list goes on. And so the kicker here, Akiko, is that it's in our own respective borders, right? The fifth largest economy within our respective borders. It's an incredibly powerful demographic for both institutions and investors to be a part of. Yeah, with that said, it's not something that we always sort of frame the conversation around when we talk about the Latinx community. Why do you think that's the case? You know, I think ultimately organizations really need to pinpoint and say to themselves, okay, how important is diversity, right, within our respective organizations and diversity of thought, right? And can we actually, you know, invest in this particular space to grow the market, right? At the end of the day, we know very keenly at this junction that investing in diverse managers, investing in diverse perspectives is is is can lead to to outperformance, right? And there's certainly value there. An institution certainly have a role to play here. They can invest in emerging managers, whether it be on the public side, whether it be on the private side, on the private side, you've seen venture capital firms. Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this Tuesday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs and Richella Kufo. Let's get you up to speed on the market action. We're seeing a bit of a reversal here in the final couple hours of trading. To you look at the Nas at compositive now off just around 1.4% S&P back in negative territory, off just around 8 tens of up percent, Dow barely holding on to gains actually to see right now just at the flat line here. Some comments coming out in the bank of England, Governor Andrew Bailey that's spooking the markets just a little bit. Russell 2000, though at least for now holding on to gains up just around 4 tens of a percent. Take a look inside one of the major averages. Let's take a look at the Dow. The reason why we're not seeing larger losses here for the Dow right now a lot of that has to do with the gains that we're seeing from and Jen and bullish call here from Morgan Stanley pushing that stock up just around 5.5% we also have wall greens here holding on to gain here. So the gains in those two stocks the big reason why we aren't seeing broader losses in the Dow. I want to pull up the mobility sector and specifically look at what's happening in Uber, DoorDash and Ly-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,71,2022-10-11 19:02:29
3060," green tier holding on a two game here. So the games in those two stocks, the big reason why we aren't seeing broader losses in the Dow. I want to pull up the mobility sector and specifically look at what's happening in Uber, DoorDash and Lyft. You can see Lyft off just around 12% a new proposal from the labor department. We'll make it harder for these types of companies to classify their employees as contractors. So massive implications here for their business model. We're seeing that reflected in this stock. We're actually lifting and all time low, a 12% drop today. DoorDash also hitting an all time low in Uber. You can see off just around a 10%. I also want to take a look at some of the losses that we're seeing in the banking sector. You can see red basically across the board here. JP Morgan, Goldman, UBS, a city bank of America among the biggest declineers here. City, JP Morgan and a city all hitting 52 week lows and move lower here coming ahead of earnings that kick off later this week. Michelle? All right, we're getting you up to speed on global growth. The worst is yet to come. And for many, 2023 will feel like a recession. That warning from the IMF's chief economist as the organization's latest outlook predicts global growth will slow to 2.7%. And that's lower than its July forecast. Now, excluding the peak COVID years, the IMF sees quote, the weakest growth profile since 2001. The report says the three largest economies, the US, the EU and China will continue to slow. And more than a third of the global economy will see two consecutive quarters of contraction. Now, the biggest drivers rushes on Bayesian of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis and China's economic slowdown. We already see the Bank of England intervening again with another bond market rescue effort. Some silver lining albeit in the longer term, the IMF does expect global inflation will decrease to 6.5% next year and 4.1% by 2024. Dave? All right, thank you, Michelle. Joining us now is Ann Berry, the threat needle ventures founder and nice to see you. So you've got the IMF, the Bank of England weighing in, the UK finance minister rolling out the budget three weeks early. What is coming the UK's way? You know, I think they're just going to be a tsunami of continued bad news. And really the reason I say that is because there is now such a crisis of confidence, a real sense as Europe looks at the UK, as the US looks at the UK, that the government that doesn't know what it's doing and it's not thinking through the repercussions of some of the incredibly fast blitz policy it's putting in place. So I think the UK, I think the power continues to get decimated and the guilt continues to get decimated. I think the Bank of England's got a real issue in its hands when it clean up the mess that the trust government has just imposed on it. And the headlines cross right now from Andrew Bailey saying that market volatility went beyond the bank stress test, also saying structural issue prevented targeted intervention. We're seeing the worry here reflected in the US markets. What does it mean for losses here just in terms of the downside risk? And you used to what this? All right, it looks like we just lost in here. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back. We're going to try to reestablish that feed and we will be right back.

3061, So OK. just about 54 minutes to go until the closing bell. Look at that. You're looking at the losses accelerating here. Dow now back in negative territory was up over 300 points at the highs of the day. SMP off just around 910s of a percent Nasdaq leading the losses here up just around 1.5% we know technology and communication services have been under pressure Dave for most of the trading days and the comments coming out of Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey here spooking the markets in the final hour. And you've got a lot of comments from the Fed all week including today that continue to sound a hawkish note. Not just sounds like we're still going to hit that 75 point hike to fourth straight but it sounds like staying tighter longer is what we continue to hear from the fed. So what's going to be the catalyst as we see markets move back up what can it be we're going to get CPI number on Thursday we're going to start seeing those bank earnings the big bank start to report on Friday you showed us earlier the big banks some of them near 52 week lows could that be a catalyst doubtful given the macro environment given all the headwinds for this economy Rochelle so it looks like we're going to trade sideways if not search for a new bottom now for days if not weeks. I mean and you're seeing with the VIX it's above 33 at the moment so clearly that that fear of recession that fear of contagion that what we're seeing with the bank of England now really having to to play catch up here with what we're seeing with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer they're quite me quieting as he's trying to manage this this fire that's going on in the UK right now so obviously concerns there it does make it more difficult for the bank of England and perhaps a lot of people looking to wonder what this means for the Fed the Fed is determined to stay the course with even with every data point that comes out but you know that that increased hawkishness as we see that global inflation isn't going away as we see these comments from the IMF warning about slower global growth really going to start to take a toll if we don't see some sort of turnaround anytime soon yeah and you can't help but wonder how long does the Fed keep the year months on because there have been a lot of global warming but they've continued to sound a hawkish note regardless of what they see happening around the globe and you asked Ann Berry about this what is the impact on our economy if in fact the UK goes into recession and some say they already are in a recession and Ann Berry just told us a tsunami of bad news is ahead it's also behind yeah exactly and I think lots of speculation whether or not inflation has peaked we certainly got some commentary out from Fed officials recently just saying that maybe we haven't seen peak inflation so and of course you have to ask what that means for the economic impact Jamie Diamond earlier this week saying that he expects the US to tip into a recession within the next six to nine months here so certainly a lot of worry out there on the street I think the question is what has been priced into the markets at this point what has not been priced into the markets and then of course what that could mean here just in terms of the moves that we could see at least over the next couple of months one stock under quite a bit of pressure today is meta the stock off and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,73,2022-10-11 19:11:37
3062," And then of course, what that could mean here just in terms of the moves that we could see at least over the next couple of months. Well, one stock under quite a bit of pressure today is meta the stock off nearly 5% here. They did though announce new partnerships also products today at its virtual event meta connect Yahoo finances. Ali Garfinkle is here with the latest and Ali a new VR headset. One of the big headlines coming out of this event, which is very, very expensive. Yes, it is very, very expensive. Shana, but they're touting it as kind of their new highly advanced headset, right? For instance, they're saying it's going to have better comfort, better visuals, mixed reality opportunities. And there is a huge price golf. I was looking at an Oculus recently. I was considering buying it. That was for about $400. This is about $1,500. So it's a huge golf and they did announce a new partnerships. For instance, Iron Man VR is coming to meta quest 2. However, how they're imagining you using this headset maybe isn't quite what you're thinking. They see it as a key part of the future of work. The future of work that they articulated definitively involves the quest pro. Well, and Ali, we also got some news here about meta teaming up with Microsoft. A lot of this has to do with just trying to get us immersed in this virtual reality. I guess what can you tell us about this? And do you think it's going to do the trick? You know, Shana, we'll see. I was surprised certainly when Sachin Adela rolled up to meta connect. And the thing that the partnership articulated was that all of Microsoft's enterprise software, things that people use like Teams, Microsoft 365, they're all going to be available in VR now. And the quest pro is set to begin shipping October 25th, right? So there's a sense that they're hoping this will happen sooner rather than later. But it's important to remember that even with this partnership with Microsoft and other partnerships across the board, what I was hearing was that there were a lot of big statements about next year. So yes, they partnered with Microsoft. That's great. But there isn't necessarily a clear sense of when some of this stuff is going to roll out. I couldn't help Shana, but think of a time recently when I was talking to an expert about meta. And the thing he said is just because they have the name doesn't mean they have the tech. So we'll see hopefully they can roll some stuff out soon. Their stocks certainly needs the help. Ali, Dave, you're at Saturdays, though you might be in the market for one of these VR headsets. I'm curious if you spent any time in the metaverse because the article on the Wall Street Journal is pretty savage review. It's out of the employees do not really want to use it even though they are being encouraged to. They were seeing notes leak out that they're not really enjoying the experience. Do you have an Ali review? An Ali review of the metaverse, you know, I do and the thing I can tell you, Dave, is I started bumping into things a lot. I was not particularly good at being in the metaverse. So at a certain point, my review may be suboptimal. I was running into desks. I was running into my closet door. It wasn't ideal. To me, the experience clearly still needs a lot of work. But what I will say is meta's beta's whole company on it. They clearly believe. And I go back to that thing I said. They weren't necessarily clear about when some of this stuff is going to start emerging. But I am still metaverse curious, Dave. That's what I would say. Metaverse curious. Okay, not as bad as what we've heard from some out there, although not really a review. I don't think that's going to get a lot of people to try it for the first time. Ali Garfingle, thanks so much for that. We mentioned the losses that we're seeing in meta today. Part of that has to do with the downgrade that the stock out from Atlantic equities. The analysts they're lowering is rating from overweight to neutral. Also cutting is price target to 160 bucks. Well above where it is a trading today. Rochelle, lots of questions just about the metaverse Facebook's pivot here. It's total rebranding. You know, you're to date the stock sale off 62% even with the product announcements and the partnerships announcements that we just heard from Ali. Clearly Wall Street is not totally on board. I mean, and you have to wonder when you look at the price tag. Not just of what meta has now invested in trying to make this pivot to the metaverse, that we have no idea in terms of the time horizon when we'll actually see it. When you figure $1,500 for a headset on top of everything else, it's as Ali said. So creating tech for something that's not actually here, but it's not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,74,2022-10-11 19:15:45
3063," Verizon will actually see it when you figure $1,500 for a headset on top of everything else. It's as Ali said, you're creating tech for something that's not actually here that's not got wide, wide mainstream adoption at the moment. I do have concerns, obviously, when it comes to the timeline and what Meta is doing right now there, it's a long play. We're seeing some of these plays, things like roadblocks, other companies wanting to put a foot in the door, but certainly not investing to the extent that Facebook is. At a certain point, shareholders are going to want to see some returns on this investment. But those might not come for some analysts have told us, ten, maybe even fifteen years. It is remarkable the downfall of one of the great companies on the planet. And back to that headset real quickly, the Wall Street Journal with a review said with the short battery life and the price tag, it's out of touch with reality. And the Washington Post called it the MEP, as an MEH, MET diverse, so not great reviews for what they hoped would dispel some of the bad news, including the downgrade from Atlantic equities, which cited not just the metaverse, but the ad market out there. Is it a really bad place? And as we talked about with Brent Thill last week, he said, look, going into a recession that is the first thing people cut. And Meta is already falling behind Google and everyone is falling behind TikTok. So if we had a recession, that's the first place they're going to cut. So what do you like about Meta right now? The Metaverse doesn't look good, the ad revenue doesn't look good. I don't know what the bearish story is. Exactly. I don't think Wall Street, I don't think there is a lot to like about it. When you take a look at the performance that we've seen here today. The privacy changes. Just over 60 percent, the privacy changes, like you mentioned, they're a $1,500 VR headset. I get the concept of it trying to make it more accessible, trying to entice creators and working professionals to adopt this vision that Meta clearly has of a virtual future. I just don't know if it's going to be enough and don't think it's going to do the trick just in terms of getting people on board with the Metaverse. I think that $1,500 price target meat or price tag, maybe I'm wrong. That is just too expensive and it's a little bit too much for people to pay out when they're not even sold on the Metaverse yet, Michelle. And I thought it was interesting that if the idea is that they want people to use this in the workplace, then what did people come back to work for to then sit there with a VR headset on? It's sort of like moving in the opposite direction with where the future of work seems to be headed. I mean, and when you look at roadblocks, which is also considered a mini Metaverse play, they're stock also not doing well and we saw that they were rated underweight in new coverage of Barclays as well. They're saying that the platform, it still was a primary beneficiary of the pandemic when everyone was stuck at home, but again, once you're now out of the worst of the pandemic, where do you go from here? And I think this is something that roadblocks is just that microcosm of what some of the challenges that Meta's going to continue to have. Boy, look at that stock chart for Firmetta. Four-year low and that note, we mentioned Atlantic equity, says they're going to lose an additional 5% market share in the next two years from position that is already an ugly one for Meta. October 26th, earnings. Excited? I am excited. It's going to be an interesting one for us. Coming up with more companies embracing ESG measures, the CEO of just capital fills us in on how the process could and should become more transparent. We'll be right back. Let's open up and talk about the two uses of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,75,2022-10-11 19:20:09
3064,". Welcome back, Marketsy Racing Gaines is, we head towards the closed Jared Blyckres. You're with a look at the action and what is driving them down. Hey man, that's right. I was looking at the time stamps. We had a big sell off and I'm going to get to that in a second, but I want to show you the British pound because the timestamp match up perfectly here. Now this is inverted. Usually we see this the other way around, but this means a strengthing dollar. This is intraday and right before the bond market closes, our UTC times by the way, we had Andrew Bailey. He is the Bank of England governor. He was speaking in Washington and he was basically talking his line about how they're doubling down on this bond buying program into Friday, but he warned because they are trying to stabilize market prices in British guilds for their pension fronts. You need to get these transactions done by Friday. That is a message, message pension funds. We saw the U.S. dollar appreciate on this and I'll show you what happened in the market. It was a very steep sell off. Now percentage wise, it wasn't the biggest. You can see in the S&P 500, we're not even down 1%. But I measure something called the New York Stock Exchange advancing issues, minus declining issues. In other words, nicely ticked. That was registering minus 1,500 readings, something I haven't seen in weeks. This is a very illiquid market. Could have something to do. These headlines appeared right before the bond market closed at 3pm. That could be a factor because yesterday was closed for the bond market. Adding it all up, I would say the markets are still structurally weak. You take a look at the year to date in the S&P 500. We are knocking on the lows of the year right here. So we'll have to see what happens in the final 40 minutes minus a couple here in trading. Jared Blickery, thank you my friend. Good to see you. Rochelle. All right. Well, Yahoo, finance is Julie Hyman is live from the Greenwich Economic Forum with speakers are discussing portfolio strategies and alternative investing amid all these market headwinds. She's joined now by just capital CEO Martin Whitaker. Hey Julie. Hi Rochelle. Thank you so much. Indeed, I'm right here with Martin Whitaker. And just capital is a firm that looks into everything ESG, but sort of beyond that as well, sort of making corporate America a more just place. And there's been sort of a backlash against this sort of ESG movement, if you will. You've had some ETFs that are anti ESG. So kind of how are you thinking about that environment right now?wend introduction to the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,76,2022-10-11 19:24:28
3065," If you will, you've had some ETFs that are anti-ESG. So kind of how are you thinking about that environment right now? Well, there is a distinction, as you said, between what just capital does and the ESG movement. I've been in that space a long time. And I think there is a lot of criticism around the ESG, the ESG investing that is valid. And ESG has sort of not really addressed a lot of issues like standardization, quality of data and meaning and things like that. What just does is we pull the public on what issues matter. We track big publicly traded corporations on how they're doing on those things. And then we bring that to market in the form of investment products, indices, data, media, content, and so on and so forth. So for us, we're really in the business of tracking what our company is actually doing. And then when you pull the public and ask them what they think about this, Americans are actually united, not divided. We see a huge amount of agreement across political lines as well, but by income, by geographic location, et cetera, on companies doing more. And the last thing I'll point out, which is really important, given where we are right now, is that it's good for business. All the just indices have outperformed their benchmarks since inception and live trading. We've got the spread between the top 10% and bottom 10% over the last, since January 2018, it's a spread of over 40%. So we think it's good for business. But do companies think it's good for business? And especially do they think it's good for business? I mean, it's easy to say something's good for business, you can do something when everything's going well, right? It's when times are getting tougher, that that's when it's a true test of a new way of looking at your corporate balance sheet, for example, and your spending, et cetera, all of that. So is that sort of holding up and do you expect it to continue to hold up if we go into a recession? I do, I'll tell you why. I think we saw during COVID, how many companies responded, during a complete shock to the system, turned out companies that were leaders on investing in their workforce, for example, were much more resilient during that period of time. We haven't seen a pullback from the companies that we work with, so we engage probably over 500, maybe 600 companies. If anything this year, we've seen an intensification of their engagement with us, working with us on the underlying issues. That's kind of interesting. So no, I think companies that believe that this is good for business, are in it for the long haul and probably see it as a way to actually more effectively manage your recession. The other thing I wanted to ask you about is, during this period of time when the workforce has been so tight, right? You have seen this surge in power of the worker. You've seen a surge in unionization. You've seen people sort of saying, I want to be hybrid and getting that as the job market starts to change and shift, and we start to see maybe layoffs pick up. Do you think they'll retain that power? Well, I think it's constantly shifting, you know, who wear that power really resides, but it doesn't take away from the fundamental issue of companies that invest in their workforce, provide great training, good benefits, you know, they have better retention, better productivity. You know, the business rationale is very strong, and company leaders, CEOs and boards that get that, believe that that's part of their competitive advantage. So I don't think you become a good employer one day, and then a bad employer the next day, depending on how the labor market's moving. I think you, Ewe, that's part of your business to CREDO, or it's not. But I guess there are more companies sort of making that part of their business CREDO by necessity over the past couple of years, right? And I just wonder, is that necessity that impetus going to be taken away a little bit? I mean, we'll find out. I think we didn't really see it during COVID, like I said, and the economic shockwave that happened after that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,77,2022-10-11 19:28:31
3066," I mean, we'll find out. I think we didn't really see it during COVID, like I said, and the economic shockwave that happened after that. I think companies today are beginning to see human capital as a real source of alpha. We see that in our own research. And so if you're really trying to protect from the downside, batting down the hatches, you might feel like you've got, you know, more of an ability to control wages, for example, or the amount of money you spend on benefits. But, you know, and maybe short-term, you have to pull some of those levers. But for the most part, I like to think that companies that we've seen so far are who believe that human capital is part of what makes them special, will continue with that. Here's hoping. Here's hoping. Martin, it's good to see you in person, especially. Martin Whitaker of Just Capital. Thank you. Back to you guys. All right, great stuff. I'll very own Julie Heimannet with Martin, Whitaker. Bye, well, Shares of Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash falling sharply on a new proposed rule on how gig workers should be classified. We'll have those details for you after the break. Secondly, how do you think it's your first job to territory? If you're interested in education,ία,pas, Doordash lift uber all-ticking massive hit today on a new proposal that could shake up the gig economy, the plan from the Labor Department, would make it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors. We want to bring in Angela Zino, CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst. Angela, it's great to see you. Ahead of this announcement, you had a buy rating on uber, buy rating on lift. What are their implications? Do you think, if in fact, we do see this rule go into effect? Yeah, I mean, listen, I think this is, right now, just kind of a proposal that's out there. I mean, from my understanding, if this goes into effect, it essentially just reverts the standards to the Obama administration era.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,78,2022-10-11 19:33:22
3067," From my understanding, if this goes into effect, it essentially just reverts the standards to the Obama that it demonstrates an error and doesn't fully result in a full reclassification of drivers. That being said, clearly, it would probably have some implications on the margin profile of these companies to the downside. Our view is clearly there are different factors at stake here. I'm looking at each one of these individual companies. They do have flexibility to do other things in terms of pulling levers on the pricing side of things to offset potentially higher costs out there, which you would expect to take place if this were to go into effect. That being said, I think the outlook is very mixed at this point in time. We do think we were better positioned than left as most would think if this were to go into effect. Now, who has already been under pressure down 41% year to date? What would you need to hear from the companies that would instill a bit more confidence if this proposal does in fact go through? Yeah, I mean, listen, I think first and foremost, we have to see exactly what kind of some of the details are here because at the end of the day here, when we think about how this is going to be looked at, most of these, we believe most drivers out there continue to prefer the flexibility and utilize these platforms as a secondary source of income. Even if this rule were going to affect the vast majority of these drivers would probably not be impacted in the actual cost profile would probably be that impacted. I think the bigger concern out there is, do we potentially see a full reclassification of the giga's economy over time that's clearly the bare case scenario, I think, in the broader space in general. But as far as I'm concerned here, I think what we've heard just from both Uber and Lyft today is a minor positive. We have seen Uber kind of have to navigate a change in classification out in London. And they've actually been able to kind of do it very successfully. Yeah, blog post from Lyft says no immediate or direct impact on Lyft business at this time, noting a 45 day public comment period. And this does not reclassify Lyft drivers as employees. This would be from bad to worse because Uber is already down 43%. Year to date and Lyft 74% year to date. But you said, Angelo, Uber is better positioned to survive this. If in fact it goes into place, presumably they have a lot more drivers. How are they better suited to handle a rule like this? Yeah, I mean, listen, the number of factors, first and foremost, they've already kind of inflicted a note. We think they've now got a business model that's sustainably free cash flow positive. But just the scalability of this company, where the market share they've got within their markets, and the size of this company allows them to kind of navigate higher costs better than Lyft out there. They're also more geographically diversified, right? So I'm going to impact within the US market probably wouldn't have as much of an impact for them as that for Lyft, which is almost entirely US-based. But clearly, these are both companies that have been significantly impacted here over the last 12 months from what we've seen in the broader stock market. And you definitely concerns about kind of the macro factors as well as we kind of look ahead into 2023 and what they could potentially have, how it could potentially impact the business as you kind of look at these, you know, in conjunction with these potential, you know, initiatives on the political side of things. So, Angela, you mentioned that macro economic factors at play here. This, of course, will put more pressure on the businesses, of course, potentially disrupting the free cash flow. But do you think this will then, I guess, potentially trigger more or some consolidation within this space? Well, I mean, I'd say right now we can look at the market. I mean, this is... Okay, we have a few technical difficulties there, but a big thank you to Angela Zeno for joining us this afternoon. All right, coming up, Coinbase, share the room.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,79,2022-10-11 19:37:12
3068," OK, we have a few technical difficulties there, but a big thank you to Angelusino for joining us this afternoon. Alright, coming up, Coinbase shares are on the rise. That's after announcing a partnership with Google. Details on that deal. mid-ass down to Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching! Thanks for watching!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,80,2022-10-11 19:41:17
3069," Some challenges here ahead of it now. It is important for now. Credit Swiss denying any improper misconduct here saying that it is cooperating with US authorities. They did put out a statement on this saying that credits was doesnt tolerate tax evasion. That's not a surprise. They also went on to say that we have implemented extensive enhancements. Ascension 2014, what you were just talking about, were shall to read out individuals who seek to conceal assets from tax authorities. You just mentioned the number of hurdles that credits was housed in front of them. We know Wall Street has had a lot of questions just about what the bank will look like 6, 9, 12 months from now. So this of course is just the latest challenge here and we are seeing that reflected in a share today with the stock once again under pressure. All right, my play today is Coinbase. A top trending ticker here on Yahoo finances comes on a new partnership with Google. Now the tech giant teaming up with Coinbase to accept crypto payments for cloud services. Customers in the Web 3 industry will get first dibs with the ability to pay a using crypto. So Google is also going to use Coinbase Prime for institutional services. This is just Coinbase's latest agreement with companies outside of their crypto space. They've got to deal with BlackRock to help manage and trade Bitcoin. They also have an agreement with Meta to support integration with Coinbase Wallets. So again, the stock popping today. Lots of questions just about crypto adoption, how mainstream it's going to be. Obviously crypto has been under tremendous amount of pressure a year to date to say the least. That reflected in Coinbase's stock sense of start of the year, but some investor excitement today. Bitcoin as well just kind of locked in Matt versus 19,000 stuck at that. And on the flip side though, and a letter to G20 finance ministers, the president of the Dutch Central Bank warned of a risk that crypto poses to investors and market confidence and suggest the potential breakup of Coinbase and other major crypto players. So not all good news clearly in the sector nor for Coinbase. Some good news though from my play, which is Walmart, always low prices. But the price of the stock is up on a note from Morgan Stanley suggesting Walmart plus could be worth $45 billion. The retail giant launched its membership program in 2020 and have been to compete with Amazon Prime. Cost is similar, $12.95 per month, that includes free shipping, delivery and savings on fuel among other benefits. Members also have access to Paramount plus streaming content, a new addition. Morgan Stanley's Simeon Gutman says, quote, we're not sure the stock is getting full credit for Walmart's progress in growing membership and for the recurring income stream it generates. Walmart does not disclose the actual numbers of members, but Gutman estimates a figure could reach 18.5 million or 14 plus percent of US households. And that represents the $45 billion figure we mentioned there. At add 17 billion to the current stock price shares up about 3% today. Down though, 8% year to date. We shall, this is a big note out on the future of Walmart plus we always talk about Amazon Prime today being their second Prime Day, which is kind of not as well received as they might have hoped. A lot of upside here for Walmart. I mean you think so clearly it's been working well for Amazon and that's the muddle to go by. Even though, obviously Walmart was the more established brand. I do think this is a very smart play from Walmart. I do have to wonder though how thin consumers can actually be stretched and will they be willing to have both their Amazon Prime accounts plus then having this with Walmart or will they perhaps pick and choose. And then when you add on bundling on top of that when it comes to them both teaming up with streaming services, it's a lot. You might have to pick sides if you just don't have the bandwidth to be able to afford both Amazon and Walmart's prices right now. Yeah, I think the bigger question also going forward is what this could potentially mean for Amazon Prime membership. We know that Amazon Prime membership has up until this point remained very sticky. If there is a competing offer out there from Walmart that continues to gain a popularity. Obviously this could be a huge challenge here for Amazon going forward. The one thing that does differentiate the two offerings here is clearly that fuel savings that Dave you mentioned there in terms of Walmart. So when we're seeing gas prices so high and now likely to creep back above $4 a gallon when we're looking at the nationwide average, I think that would be enough to entice some people to Walmart instead of what they're getting from Amazon Prime. Yeah, you put enough miles on your car.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,81,2022-10-11 19:45:59
3070," $4 a gallon when we're looking at the nationwide average. I think that would be enough to entice some people to Walmart instead of what they're getting from Amazon Prime. Yeah, you put enough miles on your cards pretty easy to make up 13 bucks in one month. Coming up, Athlete's your brand, Viori looking to disrupt the active wear market and the West Coast brand hopes a new presence in New York City will do the trick. Startup CEO tells us what to expect next. The Atlesia Explosion continues in industry estimated to be worth more than $660 billion by 2030. Get the new player in New York City this weekend the active California lifestyle brand Viori opening its first man hatton location Friday in their CEO Joe. Joe Kudler joins us now. Joe, good to see you. What's old is new again. Explain the evolution of the brand from DTC, primarily online to now brick and mortar stores. Absolutely. When we launched the brand back in 2015, we had a vision to bring a new perspective to the marketplace. We felt like the brands that existed had, just grown a little bit tired, over-distributed at mass market retail. And we wanted to do something fresh and new for men. It was all designed around this ethos of built-to-move-in, styled for life. We wanted to build a product that would take you through a tough workout into your everyday life. And the only way that we knew how to reach consumers was through the internet. And I'm very grateful, you know, being an early adopter of digital advertising, we built a really great presence online. But like all great things online, there you reach ceilings and costs of advertising have gone up incrementally since our inception. And we've found that our ability to operate stores where we can embrace community, being-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,82,2022-10-11 19:50:17
3071," things in costs of advertising have gone up incrementally since our inception. And we've found that our ability to operate stores where we can embrace community, be in service to the community, add value in people's lives, provide a really great experience in the physical world, has really taken kind of a front and center role in our growth strategy looking forward. So very, very excited about, you know, all of our stores in the US, but also especially this one that we've got opening this week in New York City. Joe, we talk about the explosion of a leisure. You mentioned the fact that you started as a mens brand. You now offer women's apparel as well. When you talk about the growth opportunity here, you're up against some major players within this space. What do you think is the potential market that you would be able to capture over the next five to 10 years? Like, we're very bullish about our business. You know, we believe that, you know, some of the most important apparel businesses of our time are being built today by active wear brands, performance, fabrications that don't wrinkle, they're breathable, they move with your body, they're just more comfortable. They're lessons that we learned during the pandemic when we were all living in sweatpants. Now we're taking those lessons and we're applying them to sportswear, product that you would wear to work, product that you would travel in, where to the golf course. You know, those are, those are very fast growing categories for us. And so when we look at the addressable market, we don't just look at the active wear space. We look at apparel in general, which we all know is very large. And we're excited to be bringing in offering not only for your workouts, but for every aspect of your life. Some of those competitors, Sean, I mentioned obviously, Lulu Lemon stands out. I'm sure more than if you said you don't get in a space that they already dominate, but you certainly have competed right with them. How do you differentiate yourself from say Lulu or Ron or Mac Weldon? I know this new store, which opens in a couple of days, is about 500 feet from Lulu. So it certainly matters to shoppers here in New York. Yeah, absolutely. We're right around the corner from Nike, a brand that I grew up with and you know, looked up to. But you know, when we think about what differentiates Viori, we were born on the beaches of Southern California. And for folks that have spent time there, you know that there's this effortless casual DNA that people live by in Southern California. And we wanted to bring that into active wear in a way that had really not been done before. Again, going back to build to move and style for life, it's product that you actually want to wear, not just product that's going to identify you as a person going to the gym. So we prioritize incredibly soft fabrics that over 50% of the materials we work with are custom developed by us to strike that balance between performance and comfort. We prioritize a modern athletic fit. So it just looks great on. And we strip the product down of all those unnecessary in our humble opinion design features that identify you as somebody going to compete in a sport or work out. And it makes our product extremely versatile. So our customers love our product not only for working out, but just wearing it everywhere, whether you're at home, you're out and about, you're going to the office, the already works for you across so many different aspects of your life. So we're very proud to have brought that versatility to the men's market. And now we're bringing a lot of those lessons, a lot of those fabrics that we're famous for to our women's assortment, which today is about 50% of our business, which are there certainly has been demand for your product is evident in the growth numbers that you've been posting over the last couple of years. But we are entering this economic slowdown. Inflation remains high. Consumers are beginning to pull back on some of their spending. I'm on your site right now. Jaggers, $94 hoodies, $96. Are you seeing any evidence of people either trading down or spending less just in terms of their overall purchases? I mean, there's no doubt that we are dealing with challenging times in the US and globally. There what we're seeing is a bifurcation between market leaders and brands that are truly differentiated and have a really unique value proposition and your middle of the pack kind of mass market legacy brands. You know, you're seeing, you know, some of the public companies in our space that are market leaders still growing, you know, in the 20-30% year-over-year range, whereas, you know, some of the legacy players are seeing flat or or copying down. You know, we're really fortunate to be in the space where we have a highly differentiated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,83,2022-10-11 19:54:38
3072," We're over year range. Whereas some of the legacy players are seeing flat or or comping down. We're really fortunate to be in a space where we have a highly differentiated position. We're speaking to a premium, it's a premium product. And we aren't seeing any changes to date between Viori and its relationship with our customers. They're still showing up. We're posting really strong growth. We're encouraged about Q4 in the holiday ahead. But we are being cautiously optimistic when we look towards next year. We're not going to try to swing for the fences. We're looking at our investments in our growth very wisely with a fine tooth comb. And we want to be intelligent as we enter this new landscape where we're not ultimately clear on what's going to happen to the United States economy. The pandemic was really good for Viori. I mean, it went from fewer than 100 employees to around 500 to expect to go to 1000. Are men and women now wearing athleisure to work? Is that post pandemic office where? Yes, in some respects, we're not seeing categories like our loungewear transition as well into the office. Still very much for your after five and weekend wear. But Viori has really made an name for itself beyond just core active in those travel commute assortments, those outdoor assortments, which for us has really rooted in outerwear. And those categories have seen an incredible growth over 2022 and we anticipate that trend to continue into 2023. And Joe, real quick, as we wrap this up, we've heard from a number of retailers over the last couple of quarters inventory levels are excessive here when we compared to what we've seen over the last year or two. What are you seeing at Viori? Absolutely. I think for a lot of our peers, you saw delays in their spring deliveries, which push product and up against fall and so we saw promotions. As we transition from spring, summer into fall, you're seeing the same thing with deliveries. As you know, the supply chain was materially broken, heading into this fall. We've been very fortunate to be very close to our supply chain and our partners. We have not been immune to these challenges. We've dealt with some delays, but materially, we're in a very good position. As the brand continues to acquire market share and grow at a very fast pace, we've been able to work through inventory challenges without getting overly promotional, which has been a goal for us since we launched our business back in 2015. Well, Joe, you got two big fans of Viori here on set. So I have a feeling we will be visiting your Soho location in the near future. Joe Kavlad, thanks so much for joining us. We wish you the best. All right, shares of Disney here under pressure off just about 2% the company announcing moments ago that is delaying a slate of upcoming films among them. Blade, Deadpool 3 and Fantastic 4. And now Blade's release is moving from September 2023 to, or excuse me, November 2023 to September 2024. Deadpool is shifting a couple of months from September to November 2024 and Fantastic 4's release now being delayed into 2025. Coming up here, we are counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street, Dow, back in positive territory. Up just 54 points. SAP and Nasdaq fell firmly in the red. The Nasdaq off 1%. We'll be right back. We'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,84,2022-10-11 19:58:56
3073," I'll hurry. We just less than two minutes away from the closing bell and the downhang on. We are looking at the average right now. We are seeing that the NASDAQ is the one that's underperforming down more than 1% and the S&P 500 down 710s of a percent. We've got the Dow on the flat line right now. Looking at the NASDAQ 100, we're watching Meta down 4%. We've got communication services which are really dragging on the NASDAQ 100. Meta flex down more than 6%. And then some of the consumer discretionary like Amazon down 1%, Tesla is down more than 2% and here's the sector action. Here's the closing bell for today, Tuesday, October 11th. Meta wraps up today's trading action. We are back and forth for most of the trading days and those losses accelerating here in the final 90 minutes of trading. We are looking at the S&P and NASDAQ closing in the red, the NASDAQ, the worst performer of the three major averages, off just over 1% down, leaking out gains up just 35 points in terms of the sector action that NS ended with their real estate consumer staples, leading the way technology, communication services or the ligaments. That's why we're seeing the NASDAQ 115. We'll let's take a closer look at the action we saw today. And for that we want to bring in Kevin Nicholson, Riverfront Investment Group, a global fixed income, a chief investment officer. Paul Schatz, a heritage capital president. Paul, let me start with you just in terms of the losses that we've seen play out over the last couple of weeks, losses today in the S&P and the NASDAQ. What's your big takeaway from the recent action that we've been seeing? Well, look, if you open up any newspaper, turn on even this regular network television news, you can't escape the bad news. It's literally a barrage day after day after day. So it's really weighing on and beating up investors psyche. Nonetheless, this is one, it's a midterm election year. When there's a decline in the midterm election year, you typically see a bottom in Q4, most specifically in October. Bottoms don't form with good news. Bottoms form when no one wants to own stocks. So if you look at midterm election years like 2018, it was December. And then you saw in 1998, 1990, 1994, 2002, the bear market low. This is what happens. I don't want to say the bottom is today on the point, but now the narrative is stocks can't make low until.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,85,2022-10-11 20:03:26
3074," the bear market low. This is what happens. I don't want to say the bottom is today on the point, but now the narrative is stocks can't make a low until the Fed pivots. And I'll argue vociferously that stocks are absolutely going to make a low before the Fed pivots. There's no dot in my mind. The key is you need to see some relief with a two-year note. The two-year notes got to pull back. It's you got to get some relief from the dollar before stocks can make a durable low. Kevin, given the language out of the Fed, are we anywhere near a pivot and is cash king? No, I don't think that we're not anywhere near a pivot at this juncture. I think the Fed is going to continue to hike until they feel comfortable that they have actually stomped out inflation. The other thing too is that we're going to see the Fed, the only way that the Fed pivots is if it actually breaks something or more importantly that there is a financial crisis. I think that would be when you would see the Fed pivot if they haven't finished with stomping out inflation. Cash is a bit of a king right now. We have in our portfolios, we have an elevated amount of cash, but unlike in years past holding cash, you're actually losing some purchasing power, just given the fact that the dollar is so strong at this time. So then Paul, as we look ahead to earning season, then as we get ready to get into the thick of it, then what are the expectations there? Paul, that's for you. I lost audio from it. I'm sorry. No problem. I was asking you about your expectations for earning season. Oh, again, just like the fundamental backdrop, it's really hard to believe earning season is going to have a lot of upside surprises. But remember, to me, it's not exactly what the news is. It's how stocks react. What you want to see is you want to see stocks go up in the face of bad news. That's a clear sign. Just like we saw in March of 2009 and April 2009, stocks are washed out. It's really hard to have good expectations coming into this earning season. Clearly, we're going to hear what companies have to say, but I want to see the reactions. I want to see stocks go up in the face of bad news. I want to see companies use the dollar as an excuse and then the Fed as an excuse. And let's not forget. The last four Fed chairs have all made monumental errors that caused that, you know, as Kevin said, something to break. And we're at that point right now. I mean, they're making another monumental error. So here we are again. I think you've got to watch for that final breaking point and then volatility should begin to calm down. I think right the beginning of the end, not the end of the beginning. Coming in earning season expected to be very volatile here. We certainly have seen estimates revised to the downside, the strong dollar, the uncertainty in terms of the economic backdrop here, all challenges here for the companies that are about to report. What do you think just in terms of, I guess, your expectations for the season and the likelihood that we could see even further a downside revisions? I have very low expectations for this earning season. If we go back to June 30th and until now, we've almost seen earnings revision for 2022 come down almost $16 and into 2023, they've come down about $11. And really what it's really showing us is that most of that change and when we look at, you know, 12 months for it, it's a little over $5 that they have come down. So what we're really looking at is Q3 and Q4 that have been revised down heavily. And so unless we get some type of upside surprise here in Q3 and Q4, we're going to see pressure on equities continue. And so I really am not holding out a whole lot of hope for going into the end of the year because when you think about the equity risk premium, it has come down this year largely because treasury yields have gone up and earnings yields really haven't moved a ton.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,86,2022-10-11 20:07:31
3075," the equity risk premium. It has come down this year, largely because treasury yields have gone up and earnings yields really haven't moved a ton, but it would argue for the fact that you would have a stable low inflation environment if, you know, the equity risk premium has come down. And that's not the environment that we have right now. Man, oh man, the bad news just piling on here. Let's see if we can find something Paul, could the catalyst be a good inflation print later this week? I mean, sure, the catalyst is going to probably come from where no one expects it. So everyone's so focused on inflation, everyone's focused on the Fed pivot. It's going to come from some roast because it always does. How many people can you drag on right now that are going to pound the bullish case other than the ones that start on January 1 and pound the bullish case? And the answer is almost none. They're very few because it's so dark. But remember, I'm not saying you should go all in and, and you'll love up your portfolio now. I think you need to be tactical or surgical or opportunistic, whatever attitude you want to use. But clearly, there are opportunities. There's always opportunity in market, especially ones that have come down so much. And look, the S&P is down roughly 25% this year. It's not like the S&P hasn't priced in at least a mod recession for Q2 and Q1 and Q2 next year. We didn't go down 25% because things are, you know, rainbows and unicorns. So I would argue, perhaps part of most of much of what's coming in Q1 and Q2 has already been priced in. We're going to see shortly how much that's reality. So tough road ahead. But as you mentioned, the opportunity is still to be had a big thank you to our market panel, Kevin Nicholson and Paul Shatz. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. All right. Well, the International Monetary Fund is sharing a gloomy global outlook for 2023 warning of slower growth and the risk of recession next year. Yeah, who finances? Jen Schonberger sat down with the funds director of monetary policy and capital markets. Jen, what did they tell you? Hey, good afternoon, Michelle. That's right. The IMF downgrading its outlook for global growth and also warning that the risks to the stability of the global financial system have, quote, materially worsened and that markets are at risk of disorderly repricing. As you mentioned, I sat down with device Adrian, the head of capital markets and monetary policy for the IMF to discuss this and whether some of the turmoil that we've seen in Britain's bond market could be a precursor for elsewhere. Take a listen. We have certainly seen market liquidity in many markets around the world. But market dysfunction, we have only seen in the UK in recent weeks. So what's happening there is that a new fiscal plan was announced and that has led to a very, very sharp rise in interest rates. And the rise in interest rates has been dysfunctional with adverse feedback loops due to financial vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector. So that's what triggered the bank of England to intervene in order to restore orderly market functioning. And while the rise in interest rates has co-move to some degree with other interest rates, that's something very normal. Interest rates tend to move together. We haven't seen a spill over in terms of market dysfunction. So you're not seeing any similar risks akin to what we're seeing playing out in the UK now that may be brewing in other markets around the world to be clear? Well, there's only risks that the situation could change. So what we've seen around the world in many countries is that interest rates have been increased tremendously in some countries, 3, 4, 5 percent in other countries even more than that. Most of the tightening has been done within orderly market conditions. So it has been that orderly tightening. And our baseline forecast is that this orderly tightening is going to continue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,87,2022-10-11 20:11:46
3076," orderly market conditions. So it has been ordered tightening. And our baseline forecast is that this orderly tightening is going to continue. Having said that, there's certainly a risk of this orderly tightening at some point. There could be dysfunction more broadly outside of the UK as well. So Warren Buffett famously has said that when the tide runs out, we find out who has been skinny dipping. So as central banks around the world have been raising rates, what sorts of vulnerabilities has that revealed? Is this perhaps the point in time where China's property market finally sees a potential for reckoning after experts have been calling for this for what 15 years now? Does the US housing market have farther to drop? What are some unforeseen vulnerabilities there that this is on masking? So there are many vulnerabilities out there and we're flagging in the global financial stability report. What kind of vulnerabilities could be acting up once negative shocks are hitting? So we see leverage, we see maturity transformation and liquidity mismatches around the world, particularly in the non-bank financial sector. And when further negative news was to occur for a variety of reasons that could indeed uncover those vulnerabilities. Switching gears slightly in the report, you note the IMF's Global Bank Stress Test shows that in a scenario with an abrupt and sharp tightening of financial conditions, that would send the global economy into recession in 2023 amid high inflation. My question is how closer we to that sort of scenario, given that financial conditions have already tightened quite a bit, would it be prudent for central banks and the Fed to perhaps hit the pause button here and take a step back, given that monetary policy operates with a lag and see how things progress before hiking further? Yeah, we are very comfortable with the humanitarian policy that is currently envisioned by the Federal Reserve and that is priced into markets. We think that this is what is needed in order to get inflation down. So to get inflation down, you need to slow economic activity to some degree. Hopefully this will be a soft landing or even if it was to be a recession, it could be a shallow recession we hope. But of course, there are downside risks around that forecast and we could see a more severe recession with a relatively high likelihood. On there you have it, the IMF appears to be on the same page as the Federal Reserve when it comes to rate hikes and fighting inflation. Of course, whether that means a soft landing or a shallow recession remain for these guys? Indeed, well thank you for that great stuff. Jen Schonberger, thanks so much for this afternoon. All right, well coming up, a new survey reveals where Gen Z is a shopping, what they're eating and which social media platforms they're using. The results and what this means for those companies and stocks next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,88,2022-10-11 20:15:58
3077," Music music I'm going to have to go back to the first one. We'll see you next time. Piper Sandler's teen survey out today revealing where Gen Z is spending its money. Now, ATHLEASURE is still a leader in that parallel space and Nike remaining the top brand in the category here to break down. The report is one of the authors. We have Ed Eramah. He's Piper Sandler's managing director ed. It's great to see you here. Lots of takeaways. I know you're focused on the top of the survey. So, Amazon, a top e-commerce site here. Amongst teens, we mentioned the fact that Nike is still a favorite brand in terms of wallet share, clothing reaching the highest record at the highest level that we've seen in terms of wallet share since 2012. It certainly seems like teens for the most part are spending. But what was your big takeaway? Yeah, I think that's exactly right. We are seeing very strong spending on teens. Interestingly, we have seen a little bit of deterioration from the spring survey. And I also note that we did have a question about how you feel about the economy. And the teens definitely are feeling a less positive than they did. So, it's certainly something to watch. But thus far, they continue to spend, as you pointed out, apparel hitting a record share among that upper income female, which I think speaks to this idea that they're out. They want their friends to see them. And they're really focused on how they look. And Ed, with Deschorena mentioned, their Amazon 52% of the teen surveyed had it as their favorite e-commerce site. How much of that is those sort of some of these Amazon brands versus it just being a convenient way to sort of get what they need? It's clearly a combination. I mean, the way the question is phrased is what's your favorite place to shop? And so that encompasses all things. And so I think Amazon for that teen is somewhat of a default. But we do think that they are buying both a private label Amazon product, as well as their favorite items that they're putting in that search box. So, clearly, Amazon is very dominant when it comes to a teen spend. But we're seeing interesting movement underneath. And Ed, when it comes to teen spend, I know you're very closely tracking threat up and the real, real. Now, we are seeing a bit of a deterioration here in terms of female interest, at least, in using the second-hand e-commerce platforms. Only 37% of teens, I sound from 41% a year ago. What do you think is driving that shift? Because you mentioned at the top there that teens are a little bit more, I guess, wary just about where the economy is headed from here. You know, it's a really interesting kind of under them, because actually from a social issue perspective, the environment was number one. So in a way, you would assume that second-hand, which is obviously very environmentally friendly, would be ranked very highly. But interestingly, we've seen engagement in second-hand continue to deteriorate. We postulate it has to do with the fact that she wants new fashion today, she's going out, she doesn't want stuff from before. She's maybe now one of the less focused on accessories, which is a real cornerstone of a lot of these second-hand sites. But obviously, she's looking for that fresh outfit when she sees those friends. And it's interesting, because even when you look at the breakdown for cosmetics, you see things like makeup and the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,89,2022-10-11 20:21:32
3078," and hand sites, but obviously she's looking for that fresh outfit when she sees those friends. It's interesting, because even when you look at the breakdown for cosmetics, you see things like elf position does the number one cosmetics brand. Obviously that's more for the more budget-conscious consumer. But then you also see alter also doing well as a preferred beauty destination as well as we dig deep into those numbers. How do you see those breaking down? My colleague who covers alphas is very constructive on it. She actually upgraded it this morning. Obviously, beauty remains a priority area of spend, I think for the female, it's number three after apparel and food. And so again, part of this idea of reopening, being out, being active. Interestingly, I think with elf, though, this is a brand that's likely very well positioned for what could be a more difficult macro, very attractive price points. And so I think that's one of the reasons why we've gotten as a firm work constructive on the name. At one brand that's missing from this list is stuck out to me. It's stuck out to some of the team here is Albert's. I know you cover that stock. Why don't you think that's a team favorite? You know, that's an interesting question, right? We do think that the core, all birds' customers historically been, that older customer, older meaning 20, 30-year-old, predominantly male, you know, it just hasn't really resonated the same way we think with the team consumer. And so I think that's one of the reasons why you don't see it there. That said, the team is very focused on those core athletic brands right, Nike at the top, right, Lou Lemmon, and very important to them. But I think part of it is that, you know, Albert's kind of by design are a little bit more, you know, kind of casual, less obvious, maybe then some of these bigger brands which make a logo of big component of what they do. And I also want to look at food because your study showed that a lot of people that you surveyed are moving away from some of these plant-based meats. And we know that before the pandemic, that was all the rays that was what people were moving into. You see, McDonald's Burger King's other brands really pushing this. Why do you think it's not resonating with some of the people that you surveyed? You know, it's interesting. My colleague that covers that would just say that ultimately, you know, the team cares about taste first and foremost, as I think most people do. And certainly, you know, the taste profile that the plant-based meat companies have provided are just not, you know, not as good as the real thing. And so I think that's, I think, one of the reasons why, you know, we're seeing this uptick in terms of the consumers that the plant eat, actually less plant-based meat. Eddie Ramo, very interesting stuff here within this teen survey. Thanks so much for coming on and bringing Tom for us. We appreciate it. Thanks. All right. Some sad news to pass along. Day, Angela Landsbury has died at the age of 96. Landsbury's family confirmed the death in a statement saying she died peacefully at her home in Los Angeles.

3079," Music Welcome back. The classic brand Topway is expanding its reach. Consumers are now able to find its products at Target locations nationwide. Miguel Fernandez, Topway CEO, joins us now along with Yahoo! Finances, Brooke, DiPaba. So welcome Miguel. We know this isn't Topway's first collaboration with Target. You had one in 2002. But what's different about this time and what are you hoping to achieve for this Omni Channel approach? Okay. So, you know, happy to be here with you. And as you said, we try Target, target approach about 20 years ago. You know, obviously a lot of things have changed in the last 20 years. And the most important one is, this time around, we're going to let each channel to operate independently. When we tried to do 20 years ago was to involve ourselves force within the target stores and having help with experience by an entire target. We know that that doesn't really work with consumers because if you're walking down the aisle, what do you want is your shopping experience being like a normal shopping retail experience and not have anyone or someone coming and trying to recruit you or selling more products and so on. So this time around, we are letting the channels operate by themselves. And obviously the whole Omni Channel strategy is the strategy of the company. About a couple of years ago, we identified that the biggest hurdle that we have to grow our business as big as our brand, which is huge and it's iconic, is that the consumers don't have access to our products. So we want to be where the shoppers go and prefer to shop. In this case, in the US, we know there's a lot of consumers that shop on retail and there's some other ones that are going e-commerce and there's still some in direct selling. Now we're trying to start expanding our channels of distribution and that's the whole strategy of the company. And speaking of that direct sales consumer, of course, a 76 year old brand known for those tab wearer parties, but you noted in your LinkedIn posts, acknowledging that younger customers are less familiar with direct sales. So my question for you is, can we expect those tab wearer parties to be around for another 76 years and how do those play into your long-term growth? Yeah, absolutely. So if you think about it, in Target, we're going with only 2025 skis and we carry on every single month over 200 skis. So our direct selling channel and our tab wearer parties are going to continue to be there. So are they going to change? Are they going to bolt? I think they will. So obviously we have technology and people can actually interact and have a lot of information and sharing, even prog demonstrations through a video as we're having this interview and you don't really have to have that physical presence. Along with a price, what we're seeing in many of our developments.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,91,2022-10-11 20:29:21
3080," information and sharing, we've improved demonstrations through a video as we're having this interview, and you don't really have to have that physical presence. Same with our parties. What we're seeing in many of our developed countries are more and more parties, what we call E-parties, which is people that host consumers and they have these communities around the screen. So a combination of both. One of the things of our companies that we want to make a top of our everyone, so if you want to be the traditional top-of-the-art parties and you want to meet your customers and organize it physically, that's going to be an option for you. If you want to go on organize a virtual party, you can do it also. And if you're a shopper, you want to do it on e-commerce, you can also do it on retail, whatever suits you. And on that note of the history of the brand, Top-of-the-art brand was originally founded in order to help families save money on food waste, following the Great Depression. Now in 2022, costly food also in focus year groceries at 13.5 percent in the month of August. Do you think that that mission to help customers save money on food waste still sticks today? Very relevant. Last month I was reading this article that stated that 10% of the meals consuming the U.S. days last year were from leftovers. So that means that consumers, every 10 times they have a meal, pretty much every three days, they're eating from the leftovers that most likely there were obviously story in a top-of-the-art container. And we know that a lot has changed in terms of how people store food, but then we also saw this, the vintage collection come out in the product placement in the hit TV show The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Talk about how you're reaching consumers where they are now and how you really want them to view the brand, since there are some of these cheaper options out there as well. Yeah, I mean that's a great question. Obviously, our brand has always stand for quality. And the test to that is that those products we were selling probably 45 to two years ago, obviously there's an update in the residence, but not in the design of a product. And it's still very relevant when we put it out in the market, they just flew because everyone wanted the product. But to me the most important thing about the brand is that let's face it, it was literally dated and it was dated because we were reaching just certain amount of consumers. What we're trying to do right now is to gain brand relevance and to be where the new consumers are, where the new people are, and wherever they are. And that's something that we have to be intentional about because if you think about it, it's very simple to say that now Topper was going to be selling some of the products in Target. But if you think about it, we need to bring the skills, we need to build a company within the company to make sure that we serve the targets of this world better. Meaning in supply chain systems that way we put the product, you know the labels, the boxes, the packaging, everything is different from one challenge to another one. So for us, that transformation of the brand starts with even the back office functions, which is what we've been trying to build or we've been building the last two years and to get us ready for this moment. For us, it's very, very important that we come across as that brand, that is a premium brand, but it was a brand that offered products and innovation 76 years ago and the products lasted and and and through all these generations. And the proof of that is that every single person in America has a story about a talk we're containing and how mothers and daughters are fighting over them and you know the leftovers are important, but I really want my top or container back because this is my treasure and since we knew that there were so many people fighting over those vintage collections. So you know obviously taking advantage of the of the of the Netflix show and everything that happened, we we launch it and obviously we we we saw a lot of success with those products. And I can I speak to that I don't play what it comes to getting my top away and back either, but I do want to ask you about what we're seeing. Obviously the stock has been under pressure even as you look over the last two years with the pandemic down about 70% over those two years. Where do you see the next part of Top Wars growth story coming from? Where do you hope it goes from here? So absolutely so you know obviously the stock is the reflection of a continuous performance of the company. We had us as we mentioned in our",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,92,2022-10-11 20:33:37
3081," So, absolutely. So, you know, obviously the stock is a reflection of a continuous performance of the company. We had us, as we mentioned in our early schools, we had some external headwinds mostly gone from overseas, Europe and China, different factors, mostly around COVID and China locking down and things like that. But the growth opportunity we see it pretty much everywhere, where our consumers know or brand, they love our products, they've seen our products, they really want the products, but they have no access to it. So, we are, you know, obviously we're building, again, a company within a company, but more and more you're going to see our products in more of the traditional channels. And we're going to be, again, where the consumers shop. In some parts of the world like Latin America and some parts of Asia, direct selling is a very relevant channel. And we're going to be investing 99% of our resources into making our core business, which is direct selling even better and better in those countries. In some other countries like Western Europe or the US, we understand the consumers moved or some of the consumers moved from direct selling into e-commerce or retail. And that's where we, that's where we want to be. Once we start, you know, competing like any other consumer brand in the shelves or in the screen of the major retailers, then we're going to be considered like any other CPG company. And our performance is going to be judged by our performance of the numbers. And if we are able to achieve great products with where quality that consumers love and they're willing to pay the prices that we believe are products of worth. And it's just going to be a normal company. So the did that we're seeing, I think it's part of our turn, turn around, it's temporary because we're still making a lot of changes. We're not there yet. But we're in the process. This that we're targeting is a big step for us, obviously. Indeed, looking forward to seeing it in our local targets. A big thank you to Miguel Fernandez, top-where CEO and Yahoo! Finances, Rupto Palmer. Thank you both. Thank you so much. All right. You're very welcome. All right, coming up with inflation, weighing on Americans wallets, we're seeing the consumers starting to cut back. And you report details where people are streaming their spending and where they aren't. Stay tuned. You You You You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,93,2022-10-11 20:37:31
3082," and the summer. Consumers are making some tough decisions on spending habits during record inflation. Now a new report from the National Research Group revealing some of the most surprising choices here over 40% of consumers saying that they have cut back on restaurant dining and also groceries over the past six months, but get this that 18% there only 18% are saying where where consumers or that they are cutting back on streaming when you take a look at some of the satisfaction numbers Dave within this survey 94% saying that they are very satisfied with the money that they're spending on TV and streaming 95% saying that they're satisfied with what they're spending on Amazon Prime only 72% saying that they're satisfied with what they're spending on dating apps with those that are cutting some of their subscription services the first to go are the dating apps now that makes sense to go and get this that's not a good idea to go and get this right. So the first thing that we've had is the shock that streaming wasn't higher on this list quite frankly with times of tough the last year or two. It's been one of the first conversations we've had at home about why do we have so many streaming service when we watch so little television. I expected most Americans were starting to evaluate their streaming platforms because the prices continue to go up. You have so many options and there's not a lot of content that is really that sticky. So that was a real surprise me and reshock what else shocked me is 17.8% of household budget is spent on subscription services. Now that doesn't just mean streaming. That does mean like Amazon and Walmart plus products and services. But that is an enormous number. We are now committing to some type of subscription service. Another surprise from this study. No, I would agree. I think maybe what part of the reason why people aren't really to give those up it's it's steady. You know exactly what the price is going to be every month. Whereas as you've seen with food inflation you don't know what you're going to be doing. Whereas as you've seen with food inflation you don't know what your groceries are going to cost when you go out through a restaurant. You don't know what the prices are going to be how much you're going to have to tip. So those prices are really going up. So it's a lot harder to judge how much it's going to be every time you come out. Whereas at least with streaming you have some consistency there. You can consistently budget for that every month. I'm not giving up my groceries and eating out. But it depends on what your priorities are and live. I would gladly cut out some streaming if it came to food. But that is just me short of what would you be worst of you let's give up on this list. Real quick and just wild ed. What we're seeing on the screen was a huge surprise to me. Brands consumers most associate with subscription services in terms of media. Amazon at number two ahead of Hulu, Disney, and YouTube where conversely when they asked consumers products and services subscriptions, guess what didn't make the top five? Amazon. Really? So in the eyes of the consumers, Amazon is primarily media, not products and services which is baffling to me. That's a very surprising answer. There's an Amazon box on my doorstep just about every week. Yeah, every day. Actually, it's a very different way. I do associate with Amazon with the products. I mostly use it. I'm on there every single day. I just place two orders actually this morning rather than their prime video service. So that is an interesting twist here to this. Very surprising findings in this study. All right, moving on now. Quite quitting seems to be all the rage with the kids these days. And so it seems employers are now going quiet on the hiring process. Yeah, who finds it's contributor, Mandy Woodrow, Santos is here with What to do? Should this happen to you? Hi there, Mandy. Hey, how's it going? Good. So what is this? Is it ghosting in the hiring process? Is that what we're calling it? Listen, I mean, I think you can call it a bunch of different things. But the reality is that you have companies who are maybe not quite ready to entirely give up on hiring right now. But what they're doing is pausing. I mean, Amazon just announced last week that they're doing a huge pause across the corporation and their retail sector of new positions. And they sent that memo to the recruiting staff. So you know, 10,000 people. Those are the number of job openings. Probably just had their job process, their interview process halted. So I'm here to offer some strategies on what you can do if that ends up being you through no faults of your own. So then, Mandy, what do you do? Is it worth you keep following up? Do you try and pivot? What are the strategies that you should really take on when someone is pretty much just ghosted you as an employer? Yeah, so I run a group coaching community and I see this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,94,2022-10-11 20:43:08
3083," up to you trying pivot one of the strategies that you should really take on when someone is pretty much isn't just ghosted you as an employer. Yeah, so I run a group coaching community and I see this. I get DMs from my own Mandy Muddy Makers who are like, hey, I have not heard back from the recruiter. It's been weeks. What do I do? So yes, you can reach out to them, but I would say first, don't take it personally. You kind of have to keep an eye on what's happening in the economy and in the sector in which you work. And what the headwinds are and why it may be happening unless they have told you that you have done something wrong or that you're lacking some, you know, specific work requirement that's led them to pause your hiring. Then it's probably not your fault. And then secondly, the actually this was like last on my list, but I think I should have made it one of the first ones. Please don't go to social media and bash them through the recruiting process. You'd be surprised. People think it's like a restaurant where they get bad service. They want to go on the internet and talk smack about companies and their recruiting process. So this is the worst thing you can possibly do. And you see that on TikTok and you have to wonder, other people are going to see this and people aren't going to want to hire you because they'll think you're bashed them next. I do want to ask the, how do you know when to let go? When do you say, okay, look, this isn't working. I've done all I can. When does it time to throw in the towel? Well, we're just talking about dating apps and sometimes the job interview process can feel like dating and it's like, wait, am I putting in more effort than when I'm getting in return? Here's the thing. I'm more to dating. I like to keep all my options open. I don't know why I said that. I'm a married lady with like a child now. But anyway, I do think it's important for job candidates to keep your options open. I am a huge proponent of always having multiple pans on the fire when it comes to interviewing and keeping just to keep your interview skills sharp, but so that you also have other options and you're not going to be so pressed if company A, you know, starts to lose interest or they pause your hiring process because hey, you got company B and C waiting for you who are still interested in you. And if that's the case, you can also use the fact that you're interviewing elsewhere as leverage when you do reach out to company A, let's say they are your top choice and say, hey, I know you guys said you're pausing your hiring process, but I want to let you know I've got two hot offers on the table. And if you don't make a move, I'm going to have to take them. And that can be a good way for you to get some closure or conversely get them to restart or reboot the hiring process because you have the additional leverage of having multiple offers on the table. So you've got to be playing the field, OK? Play the field back to the dating apps. I like it. Mandy Woodrow, Santos with some terrific advice for us. Thanks so much. All right. The government accountability office says time is running out for the estimated nine to ten million Americans who are eligible for COVID relief payments to get them. The GAO says certain groups are experiencing more difficulties getting the payments, including those who have never filed a tax return, nor are filing for the first time. Those who do not have bank accounts or lack access to banks, mixed immigrant status families, those limited or no internet access and those experiencing homelessness. The payments are based on tax returns for those who missed the April 15 tax filing deadline. You have until October 17th of file, those who don't have to file a return, but are eligible for the payments, haven't until November 15th to file a simplified return. All right. Coming up, a top executive at Amazon, shedding light on how Amazon's Thursday night football broadcast is fairing. Good job.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,95,2022-10-11 20:46:53
3084," 3XELP Amazon has hit the ground running with their streaming Thursday night football package on prime numbers far exceeding expectations and topping NFL network from a year ago. Today, Amazon's Vice President of Global Sports Video, Marie Donahue, spoke at the Sports Business Journal, CAA Congress of Sports Conference, and said it even exceeded their own sky-high expectations. We're thrilled. Obviously, we're really happy with the product, with the tech, everything's working. Fans are happy. We're thrilled with our audience numbers. We're at O'Pernielson. We're averaging already 11 and a quarter million. We're up 11 percent since last year. And most importantly, most tellingly to us, we're up 67 percent in the 18 to 34 demographic. That's amazing. Which is phenomenal. And no, we're having a great time. I really think we've got, you know, we really respect the fan and respect the game. So we talk a lot about innovation and we try different things and we literally started from scratch and looked at it all new. But respecting the fan, we didn't want the fans to not recognize the game or be disrupted. We wanted the fan to feel more engagement and be delighted. And I think we've struck that balance. And I think some of it is obviously our alternate feeds, what we're doing with dad and things like that. But I think it's the talent we hired. We worked really hard, Al Michaels, Kirk Herb Street who are both legends in their own right, but bring something different and special in New Chemistry. And I think the studio show we've got, I think, is magic in a bottle right now. A strong start for Amazon. I will couch some of that data appears to be a bit inflated because in terms of a pure streaming number, they are including sports bars and restaurants as well as over the air television in the home markets that are airing on Thursday night football. I've got a real challenge this week with a stinker between Washington and Chicago, no real stars, two mediocre teams. But it has been a huge hit. And I will say that number, 67% up in the demo 18 to 34. That is music to the NFL's ears and to the NBA's ears and the rumor is the report from front office sports that the NBA Amazon will be a bitter for their next media rights package expected to fetch north of 50 billion a year. Yeah, Dave, talks that they're within or in those talks when that expires in the 2024 after the 2024 2025.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,96,2022-10-11 20:51:08
3085," Fetch North of 50 billion a year. Yeah, David talks that they're within or in those talks when that expires in the 2024 after the 2024 2025 season. It's clear that this has been a huge win for Amazon. I think the question though, at least from an analyst perspective, just what is the return on investment here? Because they're paying about a billion dollars a year for these NFL rights. When you take a look at the fact that yes, it has clearly boosted prime signups. They came out with that number after the first Thursday night football game saying that it drew a record number of prime signups for a three hour period, that three hour period though, being very key. So in terms of what that actually means here, going forward will be very important for Amazon. And also just whether or not they're able to retain those new prime subscribers at these people are just signing up on a monthly basis. So if they do, in fact, continue to use prime after the NFL season. But I wish I think from anyone's standpoint here, this was a huge, I guess. Leap here, a huge chance that the NFL took with Amazon, a huge risk that Amazon did take. And it certainly has been paying off at least up until this point. And I will say it's interesting because Amazon sometimes acts like a startup. They'll go out and try. Let me try brick and mortar stores. If it doesn't work, they pull back. And as you mentioned, depending on how things are going with Thursday night football, clearly a success so far. What's going to happen when football season ends? Are you still going to be able to retain those prime members? Will you have to then do something else, perhaps more partnerships? Definitely a step in the right direction. We'll be interested to see how Amazon plans on capitalizing this when the lights go off for sure. All right, we'll have to leave that chat there for now. But coming up, we get a first hand look at a multi million dollar Italian electric hypercar. Stay tuned. Did you guys see 7 subs, or did you see anything interesting regarding this amazing 30inho happy to tell the exact correct translation of this project? Did you see that?

3086," Hey man how you doing? So I'm here in Connecticut. I'm out of a really pinniporeta is the out of Italy and they have a hyper car EV hyper car 2 million dollar car. I mean I'll see you Paris the Vanson. Paris, tell us about this car and why are you in the United States right now. We are here to show our first production ready car. Actually it's a customer car. It's a sold car that we are now letting journalists potential customers and partners test drive. So we have been in the US now for quite some time with this car. Started in August out in Bevel Beach and then we have kind of toured around the US. We're talking about a 2 million dollar car almost 2,000 horsepower. What are US kind of consumers telling you about that? What is a vital thing about this car? I have to say we are overwhelmed with the positive response we have had. It's really fantastic. I mean the car you can as I usually say you can enjoy it with all the senses. It's beautiful to look at. It's really an experience to drive. The kind of powertrain we have can do what no other cars really can do because when you have four motors one on each wheel completely independent of each other controlled by a torque vectoring system distributing the power every millisecond recalculating the distribution. So when you when you go through the windling roads of green which where we are right now or anywhere it's a sensation. So you're working with a bunch of partners here to make this car like Reenak you're owned by Mahindra which is a huge Indian mobility and auto mode of company. How does it help you kind of make this car? It's two sort of things like parts shortages and things like that. We have been affected like everybody else. First the pandemic and the shortages of components and now the war in Ukraine doesn't help. But we have found our ways through that and yes our parent company Mahindra has supported us in finding what we what we need. So we were delayed a bit but now we are there. You know I'm excited to hear what's next for you guys. I know you guys are going after maybe the luxury premium market a little bit down below in the EV scale. So anyway thanks so much for joining us and we got to go back to the studio. All right pros thank you. Before we let you go we have a very special surprise or we wanted to wish somebody a very happy birthday. It's our very own day brings birthday. We want to say exactly what the number is. We can say I'm 46 man. 46 that's young. Doing all right. Doing thing fun to celebrate. A lot older than you two sister. Not that much older. But very very special day although you didn't bring the markets much luck today or boy it didn't bring a whole lot of luck. Our way. All right well the team here at Yahoo Finance just wanted to wish you a very very happy birthday. We hope you do something fun to celebrate either tonight. This weekend you got a little snow. All right well that doesn't have to be a big birthday today on Yahoo Finance live. Thanks so much for tuning in once again we'll be right back here again tomorrow at 3 p.m. Eastern time. Have a great night. See you guys.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GS0SPvxP2s,98,2022-10-11 20:59:27

3091," of Fed pivot. To a certain extent, I think that's fair. And the reason why the pivot is so important is because there's still room for the Fed to actually be more hawkish. I know you've got the Fed that's settling a roughly 4.6% term rate next year, but I think the real question is, when is the federal funds rate going across CPI? And I think it's going to cross sometime at the middle of next year. The challenge is I think it crosses out a higher Fed funds rate, not a lower inflation rate. And so I think the Fed and we'll get mid sometime this afternoon, I think it's certainly going to continue to show that while some committee members are concerned about a slow down in the economy, there's still laser focused on trying to bring that inflation and more importantly, maintaining that in their credibility as an inflation fighting entity. And so I think you do kind of have to see that Fed pivot because markets don't like higher rates. And the Fed may actually be in a position to do a little bit more over the course of the first half of next year. Well, that looks like not so much fun for the markets. Thanks a lot, Jordan. Good to see you. Jordan Jackson, JB Morgan, asset management's global markets, strategist, appreciate your time coming up. So I was going to share his talk. Take on a meta's VR glasses. Apparently you got legs now when you're wearing them, which is a big deal or something. Great. I don't know what those shoes for the metaverse. Today I guess. Yesterday afternoon, meta and bail a pair of $1,500 AR headsets that go on sale on October 25th. Sausage is of course fired up about these things, but not because he's a good guy. The best way to get a $1,500 AR headset. So go on sale on October 25th. Sausage is of course fired up about these things, but not because he's excited about the technology, his frustration with these is where he's looking at the video.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,1,2022-10-12 13:53:47
3092," Saas is of course fired up about these things, but not because he's excited about the technology, his frustration with these is where we find his take today. I don't even know what we're looking at video. I imagine a lot of other consumers won't know either because they're not buying these things. My take is this. I'll do a review in real time. I hate them. And I think it's an awful time for metadata becoming out with a $1,500 product at the same time. They're laying people off of their stock prices down 62%. But let me set this up here and look at some of the specs on this because we don't really need anything else. We can just have a look at this. Yeah, well, I'm getting there. I just want to give you a little flavor, flavor of what's coming up. So here's the specs on this. Big winner for Qualcomm, friends of Yahoo Finance are always on talking about their various chips. Big win for them. That is good. You're seeing 12 gigabytes of RAM. You're seeing a good bit of storage and a 90 Hertz refresh rate. Don't know what that is, but it all sounds good worth noting as well. Without being plugged in this device gets 60 to 90 minutes on a full charge. To me, that's not exactly great. You plug it in. Obviously the charge lasts a lot longer. But the specs on this are pretty impressive. That is winning high remarks. But here's why, you know, if you were investor in meta, you should view something like this very, very skeptically. And there I am with those goggles on essentially covering my eyes. First up, you're releasing an AR AR glasses while workers at meta are reportedly being purged. That is the only thing we have heard out of meta, arguably the past month on how they're calling their workforce, focusing more on expenses. And here you have Zuckerberg on a presentation yesterday. Just championing $1,500 AR glasses. It just seems totally disconnected on relative to what's happening inside of meta regarding even a product that is not a big sales driver for this company. Number two, how will these glasses help get your stock price up? That is to be determined. I would argue it is products like this that are so focused on a metaverse that doesn't even exist and may not exist for 10 years. That is hurting meta stock price continues to hurt that stock price because it's dumping so much money into products like this. And then lastly, who is spending $1500 on these glasses in front of a recession? This is far less $5,000 more than the top end of an iPhone. I think it's a very limited market at least right now. You can't wear these outside per se. You're not walking around your office in them per se. So it's a very limited, high end focus. Usually I would say dedicated to tech eaks. Overall, now there are some sales behind this as well. You know, I pulled up the IDC worldwide shipments of augmented reality headsets or forecasts to decline to decline 8.7 percent year over year to about 260,000 units by the end of this year. So here's a $1500 product into a potential recession in a market that is not really growing clearly. That is coming from IDC. And also as well in the first half of this year, the top five AR headset makers weren't meta. You can see Microsoft on their own. They weren't really making it. They had these glasses. This is just the latest generation. So the market is not growing. And this is a product that consumers are not necessarily out there buying. My take is on this maybe not a shocker. Come on, Mark Zuckerberg. Apple is going to crush you anyway. At some point, Apple is going to come out with actual glasses, whether they look like Google Glass, whatever they are, that is going to pummel anything that meta is possibly come up here. Maybe be able to wear these glasses out in public. They're going to look like glasses. They're going to do like big cool things and you're not even need these things. I mean, total waste of time. Total waste. I think I'm in the same boat and not being sold. However, I would argue that if you saw more corporate purchases because the starting point- I know, like what is the point? That's why. If the starting point at least says an entryway for them is not just going to the individual consumer, but going to the corporate consumer and saying, if you want more collaboration, you have to do it through the tools that you're giving your team. The reason that you saw, so many IBM think pads be able to be sold, especially in the era when so many companies were navigating over to whether it be a Lenovo or an Apple MacBook Pro for their employee base. It's because they were able to just say, all right, let's just buy these in wholesale, let's buy these in bulk and then we know we can run all of our applications on that. Now, we all know what the way of the IBM think pad went. But if there's an entry point, it could be more on the corporate side than an individual side. But what in the world is the value proposition? And I know this is something Zuckerberg said, you can have meetings in the metaverse. Sure. Why? I'm so happy you agree with me on this one. This is a thank you for the side. Why would you have meetings in the metaverse when you can have a Zoom? Different do it in real person. Different do it in person. Right. Right. It just, that proposition doesn't make any sense to me. Now to be clear, Zuckerberg has said this is a longer term bet. It's something that is not going to create value in a certain way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,2,2022-10-12 13:57:54
3093," I just, that proposition doesn't make any sense to me. Now to be clear, Zuckerberg has said this is a longer term bet. It's something that is not going to create value necessarily for the company in the short term. And while that may be true, in the meantime, it's causing issues for the company. Not just the points you were making, there is also reportedly a dissatisfaction with the strategy that the company is taking. And as we know, even with the cutbacks that we've seen in Silicon Valley, there's still a war for talent that goes on. So if you're losing people because they don't think they're on the right track, that's a problem. Simple analysis here. We had that Piper Sandler survey yesterday. And it showed that Instagram is in third place behind Snap and TikTok. How do these $1,500 glasses help get Instagram back into first place? How does it make Facebook more relevant again? Where it's number one? I don't see it. And that is a big problem. That is the biggest thing that is hanging over Metastock price right now. Two high expenses in slowing growth in Facebook and Instagram. Well, do you think all the grandparents who are on Facebook are going to buy these? No, I don't think they're going to buy one. I know. Not unless they need them. It's sort of a rhetorical question. Quick talk too. If you want to follow more of my product reviews, just go to LinkedIn. I have more. I really post them all there. Really? No. Oh. Guys, all right, we can continue talking about this. But coming up, why are next guests says the US economy is not immune to global uncertainty? We'll discuss next. Welcome back. I'm Brian Sussi here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,3,2022-10-12 14:01:57
3094," Welcome back. I'm Brian Sousie here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. We're seeing green on the screen today across the major indices. That's even as President Biden warned about a potential mild recession. Here's what we're watching for you at this moment. A caffeinated quarter PepsiCo's checker page is read hot on Yowl Finance this morning as the company blew a profit estimates excuse me and raised guidance PepsiCo's COFU Johnson told us moments ago demand continues to be very strong and they are pushing through more price increases. More big calls earning the season officially kicked off today with PepsiCo's results. So I'll look at a few pre earnings calls by analysts on Apple and Norwegian Cruisix. In the state of freelance workers we'll talk to the COFiver on the outlook for the gig economy as economic growth slows. Brad over to you at the Wi-Fi interact. I couldn't get out. I was at the Yowl Finance interactive was the Wi-Fi whatever it is there you are Brad. There we are. Here we are. All right. Taking a look at the dash show and industrial average right now we are holding onto some slight gains on the day by about half a percent right now for the average up by about 143 points. You've also got the Nasdaq composite tech heavy average in the green. It's up 310s per percent 31 minutes into today's trading session and the S&P 500. You're also seeing some green on the screen there. That's up a little more than 310s of a percent taking a look at as well. Some of the activity that we're seeing more broadly here let me navigate us over to some of the Nasdaq 100 names that we've been continuing to track throughout the day. It looks like broadly you've got more advances than declines here. An interesting move here that we're seeing especially in some of the retail names you've got a sharp move higher and Lou lemon on the day we've been tracking that stock throughout the week given some of the new bullish sentiment that's entered into the market talking about Lou lemon as well as the annexation to the Gen Z brand affinity with it. So we'll continue to watch Lou as we move forward throughout the rest of today's session. That's up by about 2 percent. Another big gainer here as well that we've got on the day ticker symbol MRN able dive into that one and just a little bit so stick around for that. Let's shift our broader market conversation after some data from the producer price index and with inflation showing no relief. Our next guest says that a recession may be coming for more. Let's welcome in the chief economist at EY Parthenon Greg Dacco. Greg great to have you here with us this morning. But first and foremost if we were to see that recession that perhaps many of the economists if they are right that it might be slight versus the more longer or protracted one where do you fall within that camp. Well I think we're certainly seeing the initial signs of a significant slowdown in terms of global activity. We are seeing an environment in which European growth is slowing point dramatically in which growth across emerging markets is also slowing and in which the US economy is also starting to see initial signs of a slowdown. We're not hearing from the executives we speak to desire to retrench in terms of capex in terms of hiring plans here in the US but I am increasingly concerned that the global waves of uncertainty and the financial market stress that we're seeing globally will eventually affect the US and lead us into a more profound recession. More profound recession Greg what does that look like in terms of GDP? Well we are in an environment where our baseline forecast is for a mild contraction in GDP growth next year that would come on the back of growth around 1.5% this year. So that would be a mild recession. I think that if we look at household finances and corporate finances today they are still rather healthy so that would pretend to a more mild type of recession but if the global waves of uncertainty, if the massive slowdown that we're expecting in Europe in emerging markets is exacerbating this slowdown in the US then you could be in for a global recession in which we could see a more pronounced contraction in GDP maybe on the order of 1% in the US. Greg it's hard to know what to think right now right because we are hearing a lot of prominent voices in markets and economics who are getting more pessimistic right. This mild recession was sort of the base case for a while now and now I feel like it's tilting more negative than that and that there are risks coming on the periphery that then could cause more contagion. How are you weighing all of this right now?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,4,2022-10-12 14:06:12
3095," more negative than that. And that there are risks coming on the periphery that then could cause more contagion. How are you weighing all of this right now? How do you figure out how concerned to be? Well, you're certainly right to highlight that we are navigating a world of uncertainty and it's extremely difficult for business leaders to navigate this world of uncertainty where inflation remains a key constraint, where the labor market is extremely tight, where the cost of capital is surging, and where there's massive uncertainty as to the geopolitical landscape. So it's a highly uncertain macroeconomic environment where it's very important to look not just as one at one base case, but really at scenarios around that base case. And I think you're right, risks are tilted to the downside. The baseline scenario is currently a mild recession. The upside is a soft landing of the global economy and of the U.S. economy by the Fed. The downside scenario could have some severe ramifications. If you have an excessive and disorderly tightening of financial conditions, that can have knock on effects onto certain streams of the financial sector as we're seeing in the UK with pension funds. So there are a lot of unknowns out there, and I think that makes it very difficult to forecast with accuracy. So there is some discomfort in the fact that the baseline view is a recession, but we have to acknowledge the downside risks to global economic activity. Greg, at what point do you believe some of the Fed's activity will finally start to fully show up in the data and yield some of the results or at least the parameters that they're looking for in order to either pause or pivot? Well, I think they're going to be very attentive to what happens on the global financial conditions front. What was at the NAVE annual conference over the first part of this week and Vice Chair Brainer highlighted, again, this concern about what's happening globally in terms of global financial conditions in terms of overall economic activity globally. And she highlighted the fact that we are in an environment where most central banks are tightening aggressively. And the fact that each of these central banks is tightening that aggressively has a greater effect than the sum of the individual tightening processes would normally have. And that is something that the Fed is going to be paying very close attention to as we move into 2023. Because again, the Fed leading the way has implications in terms of the dollar strengthening quite rapidly, exporting inflation into emerging markets, increasing the burden of debt for a lot of these emerging markets. And that's a concerning backdrop when it comes to the global economic environment. We know the US is not immune to these global waves of uncertainty. No, it is not. Greg Daco, EY, Parthenon, Chief Economist, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. All right, before we had to break, we are keeping a close eye on shares of McDonald's on some negative comments from city analyst John Tower. Head of the company's October 27th earnings report, power sites foreign exchange headwinds, energy cost inflation, and weakening store traffic data as key risk to McDonald's earnings days as Tower. Investors have been anchored to the defensiveness of the US business despite these risks. And we believe peak valuation leaves a little room for shares to absorb a negative estimate of visions much less of a potential slowdown in the US business. Coming up, Amazon workers in California are looking to unionize. Julie's got the details on that. Plus, more top headlines next. Come on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,5,2022-10-12 14:10:49
3096," differences Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Amazon potentially facing yet another front in ongoing unionization battles as workers at a California warehouse of petition the National Labor Relations Board to form a union. That moved the first step towards a formal vote and could see the warehouses 800 workers join the Amazon Labor Union. Petition comes as part of a wave of unionization efforts hitting companies around the nation, including Starbucks, Tripoli, Apple. They're not used to unionization moves in their workforce. This would be the first Amazon move by workers in California specifically. Canadian companies, Camaco and Brookfield Renewable partners both moving this morning after agreeing to buy Westinghouse Electric, which still services half of the world's nuclear power reactors. Now the deal will see Brookfield Business Partners sell Westinghouse to the two companies, both the buyer, Brookfield Renewable and seller Brookfield Business are part of the umbrella under Brookfield Asset Management. The deal comes as the world takes a renewed look at nuclear power following Russia's energy shut off to Europe and climate change problems grow. The smash hit at NASA, the agency reporting it has successfully altered the path of the asteroid di-morphus. After ramming its dark probe into it, scientists have confirmed di-morphus. Now orbits its parent asteroid in a tighter orbit that's now 32 minutes faster than before. The dark probe launched last year, sent back this video just two weeks ago before impact and it marks the first time humanity has ever altered the course of any celestial body. It also gives us one potential option for averting a planet ending catastrophe. Good to have that option. Indeed it is, it's time for our calls of the day guys. I'm at a shoot here with what is a, I would call it a blunt take on Apple head of their earnings on October 27th. Really interesting note by city analyst Jim Suvor, you see Apple shares up there slightly here in the early going. The headline of this report absolutely got me right up my alley. I love these, some of these crazier headlines and this one got me. He said we are not scared of Apple stock despite Halloween and investor fear. So he noted Apple stock, very Google SEO friendly nonetheless. He's listening, we're saying that iPhone demand continues to be very strong. They're selling more higher price products that is good. Sticky services sales, that is good. Also suggesting more of an Apple car push in 2025. So this is more of a longer term bullish take by Suvor at city. I think acknowledges some concerns here going into the quarter, some FX challenges, maybe slow amrdt beta three more up position.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,6,2022-10-12 14:15:01
3097," more of an Apple car push in 2025. So this is more of a longer term bullish take by Suva at City. I think acknowledges some concerns here going into the quarter, some FX challenges, maybe some slow down China, but by and large, just trying to I think bring a sense of, hey, the guys, this is Apple. They're going to get past any rough patch brought on by the global economy. Yeah, I think one thing that we do have to note within this as well is that for the iPhone, the demand is typically going to always be there. It's just a matter of where they are in the cycle, especially because so many people are able to pay off their phones through another type of necessity, which is your telecommunications, which is your phone carrier. And so that is perhaps one of the constants. It's just a matter of how much people are willing to take on a larger contract or go after a more expensive phone if their telephone provider or their service provider is able to offer them a better deal. Now it's a larger question, of course, too, right now of where in the even the little luxuries we were talking about with Pepsi, where that also kind of dovetails on over into the technology landscape as well in the consumer tech front, do consumers look at some of the little luxuries and the wearables and say, hey, that's a little luxury. Or is my service a little luxury that I can maintain? And for Apple, they've been continuing to build out that services business can be potentially an $80 billion run rate business either by the end of this year or early next year. And so that's something they continue to watch going forward in the services and the wearables division for Apple. Yeah, even if it might see some rockiness in the short term from some of those production cuts that we've talked about. Absolutely. Also another call of the one that I'm tracking here, Norwegian Cruise Line, ticker symbol NCLH, it's smoother sailing for new region after an upgrade to buy at UBS. The analyst also setting a $15 price target on the stock here and particularly they are kind of adjusting all cruise line models. It's not just Norwegian, it's Royal Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean, anyway. One of the cruise line, that's pronounced the same way. They're adjusting it for all cruise line models for slightly higher expenses due to inflation. And essentially here, when you think about the broader cruise sector, of course, there's a lot of money that we've talked about goes out the door when it's a marketing type of expense that they have to look at just to re-engage with so many of the consumers out there or the voyage takers. But then it's also on the other side, how much they're actually being able to charge for tickets in this near-term period of time. And that's something that all of the analysts have continued to have to look through the profit margin models at and try to figure out exactly where that's actually going to be netting out for the cruise line operator. Yeah, interesting time to see this call because we see fuel prices back on the rise. You have been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, we ticket pricing, notably coming out of Cardinal Cruise Line. But look, we just talked to Norwegians CFO Mark Kempe last week and he said, man, is strong? We're charging higher prices. If you look at Q3 and our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per deems are expected to be up in the high single digits. So again, there's inflation is real. It is starting to level off. We are going to see some near-term pressure on margins, but we don't believe that this is going to be a long-term sustainable margin issue. As we look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvements significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic. There you go. Really, a bullish take-out by Kempe who came aboard on a new ship. So despite the economic slowdown, you still have Norwegian and of course all the cruise lines, they order these ships well in advance, but still delivering a mighty new, beautiful ship called, I think it was the Prima. Right. And I'll just add just very briefly here as well within this call. They said they see this as the most preferred name and it's due to relatively greater concentration of domestic passengers, strong pricing given its higher exposure to the luxury segment. And the luxury consumer, whether it's across retail, consumer tech, and then even within the cruise line operators right now, continually being cited as one of the points of strength. All right, let's talk coffee. Okay. Dutch Bros. Bit of a perk up. I'm watching shares of Dutch Brothers this morning. Dutch Bro, I think it's technically Dutch Bros. It's a Brook to Palmitrae right there. Dutch Bros. I think Dutch Bros. It's a Brook to Palmitrae right there. Dutch Bros. It's a Morgan Chase upgrade to the SAC to overweight with a $38 price target. What's interesting here is the SAC was up earlier as much as 5%, so it's actually, you know, we've seen that that gain, those gains come back a little bit. But the analysts there, JPMorgan, saying the sell-up has made it attractive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,7,2022-10-12 14:19:24
3098," Up earlier, as much as 5%, so it's actually, you know, we've seen that those gains come back a little bit, but the analyst there, JP Morgan, saying the sell-up has made it attractive, sites that change permanence over time through differentiated drinks. Some interesting stuff here. 56% of customers under 25 drink, 80% cold beverages, and 60% of sales afternoon. And that's sort of more discretionary, so maybe that's a little bit more vulnerable. Oh, I guess not. Yeah, everybody's complaining about Insomnia. Yeah, think if you're drinking a giant cold brew afternoon, it could be also you're looking at your phone for the two hours before bed. That doesn't help either. But I digress. The point is here is that the analyst at JP Morgan likes Dutch bros and says that employment and stable gas braces are key to more predictable sales here, but that the company is in decent position here, and it has the capital it needs to grow the business. I think I'm going to take off a couple days from the office. I'm just going to visit a Dutch bros. Maybe it'll be my vacation. I see all the photos posted on Instagram on Twitter. People are obsessed with Dutch bros coffee. It looks beautiful, and I think it has more caffeine in some cases depending on what you order than Starbucks. That's where I'm going vacation. I'm going to go visit a Dutch bros. Oh, wait. OK, everybody, can we clip this please? Right, and since you just promised, he is going to take out vacations. I suggest that. You can miss that. That's a promise. I suggest that. I'm going to go visit Dutch bros, and I'm going to report from outside of Dutch bros with my phone. You're not allowed to log on. It's live here. I'm not allowed to log on. You're on vacation. That's what I'm declaring here. Unilaterally. Total processing. All right, coming up, a possible shake of forgate workers. We're going to speak with the CEO of Fiverr about that, and also a new study that the company is out with next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,8,2022-10-12 14:23:59
3099," Go All On Sing With Me!! The majority of bosses won employees back in the office full time. The new survey from Fiverr found that 52% of employers want their workers back in person five days a week. But 42% workers say they would consider quitting if that were the case. Fiverr CEO, Micah Kaufman, joined us now. Fiverr by the way, a platform for freelance workers. It's good to see you. So there's obviously tension here, right? There is this ongoing tension in the market. How do you think it ends up resolving itself? Thanks for having me on the show again. We're definitely seeing a very polarized view between managers and employees. And I think that if there's something very clear is that managers want this to be 2019 again. And employees cannot move back from having the experience of the past two or three years. And wanting to have more flexibility into into the work. I think that some of that is going to be resolved. But the fact that those employees are actually going to leave. And I think in order to receive that level of flexibility a lot of them are actually going to turn into freelancing, which allows them to. Define the level of flexibility that they are looking for. Okay, so that kind of answers or begin stands are my next question at least, which is where where would they go if they if they did leave there still for a lot of the companies that are either in a hybrid or purely virtual reality. For their workplace and collaboration, there's still some of the hiring freezes that are in place. Some places looking at cutting and trimming their staff. So where would the opportunities be to still retain that virtual lifestyle, even if going to or looking for other employment opportunities. That's correct. I think that a lot of companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent. And they're really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. And when you think about variable expenses, a lot of it is being answered by free answers. So a lot of the talent that are going to continue looking for that level of flexibility are going to turn into freelancing and we're seeing. Very high levels of talent coming to us to five or in similar platforms to look for that level of flexibility. I mean, a recession would mean a just a hiring boom for freelancers. I think that at some point, yes, because again, I think that more and more companies are thinking about the shift between between fixed and variable expenses. So obviously that is going to fuel if you if you go back to the wake of the previous recession right around 2009. And we've we've saw a boom in in freelancing. We saw a boom in new business formation. And a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full time employees. So they turn into platforms such as fiber to find this talent. Mike, at the same time, we've got now this proposal, although it's sort of vague on the part of the Biden administration to reclassify workers, which there's some thinking that it might eventually make some workers who are classified as freelance before. To come on the books full time. Any thoughts on that or the likelihood of that happening in the effect that that could have on your business. Yeah, I think that we with the fact that freelancing is becoming a huge force. In in the workplace, statistics show that by the end of this day. It by 2030. 50% of talent is going to be engaging and friend-assing in some form or the other. Policie makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,9,2022-10-12 14:28:17
3100," 50% of talent is going to be engaging in freelancing in some form or the other. Policy makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort. And I think that in this space we need to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. So if you look at Fiverr as an example, on Fiverr, freelancers have total freedom regarding their work. What they offer, when they offer it, and from where. So that level of freedom is something that is highly sought for, but it also comes with a price. I mean, you can't lead a totally free lifestyle and then expect to be considered to be a full-time employee. In other aspect of gig economy, maybe the situation is slightly different because they have less freedom on what they offer and how much they charge for it. This has been in the making for quite a long time. And we're actually working close with policymakers to figure out how. You know, the level of how we can level the plane field for freelancers in aspects such as access to affordable medical insurance. But that said, as I said, if you want to lead the lifestyle that allows you total freedom, you can't also expect to be considered as a full-time employee when you're not. Michael, just while we have you, over the past recessions where the gig economy roles have been available, we've seen this flow into some of the roles for freelancers or even just workers who are looking to kind of take their own employment under their own control. For your business at Fiverr, given some of the investments that you've made into the business to try and unlock these larger projects, more engagement, what from the Fiverr perspective would you be kind of looking towards to really navigate a recession as well? Well, yourself as a business. Yeah. So I think that a lot of businesses we've talked about fixed versus variable expenses. I think that a lot of businesses are actually focusing on identifying their core competencies and hiring full-time around those core competencies and looking for the more peripheral areas of expertise in turning into freelancers around those those types of expertise. If your core is technology, maybe something that is not in your core is going to be marketing or design in which cases they start to think about how to integrate freelancers into their workflows. And this is why we've seen the appearance of the chief freelancer officer, which is which is a new role within companies within HR that thinks about how to integrate that level of talent into organizations. We're seeing that rising throughout the past few years and this is accelerating right now. Micah, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Micah Kaufman, who is Fiverr CEO. Appreciate it. Thank you.

3101," Please share, comment and subscribe to my channel. Thank you. share of Uber and Lyft and DoorDash are back on the rise today after getting slammed on Tuesday after the Biden administration proposed to change the classification of gig workers that could revise them from independent contractors to employees. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox joins us now for some analysis on this. Stephen, has this now been priced in any potential change that may come in the first half of next year? It isn't now fully priced into these stocks. You know, actually I think it's more than priced into the stocks. I think regulatory concerns have been sort of the hand-ranging event since these companies went public. And what we've seen is that the companies have been able to manage through these events and actually continue to improve their business model. So I think it's being overdone at this point. Lyft has said nothing is immediately going to change about its business model just yet. Of course, that's what the company would say. Given the fact that yeah, there's still a lot of discussion that has to take place in the near term in order to see any type of reclassification go forward. But what extent should customers at the end of the day, if this does move forward, expect their prices, their fares to also have to be adjusted? Yeah, that's a great point because all the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what happens at the state level. So companies have been in discussions with various states. I think the most encouraging thing you saw without out of the state of Washington this year, which signed into law in an independent contractor plus agreement, which basically allows for some benefits. Sort of this IC plus gives the drivers flexibility plus benefits. And the companies are working to pass those costs through the customers and also reducing other costs tied to other pieces of the business to offset. Some higher costs as well. Steven, as we potentially go into a recession, what effect will that have on the sort of driver service dynamic? In other words, could there potentially be more people who are available to be drivers? Unfortunately, if there are layoffs or just do a burn lift getaway with paying them less? Like, what are going to be all those knock on effects? Yeah, I don't think Uber and lift getaway with paying them less, especially in this political environment. And I don't think they're looking to pay them less. I think if you go back and look what the companies have done, forget about what they've said, but what they've done for their drivers specifically over the last couple of years, they've worked to make their expenses come down through various methods. They've also worked to make their time on the network much more efficient. Obviously, if they're sitting around waiting for a ride, it's not as efficient. So it's really important to step back and say, okay, in a weaker economy, how dependent it has the consumer become on these rideshare opportunities, whether to drive or also to ride, and how do the network utilization rates look? On top of that, the real on-tap market is still the enterprise. So large.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,11,2022-10-12 14:36:40
3102," whether to drive or also to ride and how do the network utilization rates look. On top of that, the real on-cat market is still the enterprise. So large companies with multiple pockets of spending on transportation and food delivery. As they consolidate those things, those are real profitable opportunities for lift and uber that they can also translate into their drivers to make money. Right, a lot of focus on driver utilization to make it more incentivized in order for drivers to actually want to be on the platform and be able to take advantage of more rides. But then there's also the thought of if this goes through and that changes the classification, does that actually make it more intriguing for new drivers to sign up and increase the supply side of this broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major delta on prices here for consumers? Yeah, so one of the interesting things that I think Wall Street doesn't appreciate enough is that when you talk about these networks, the companies aren't playing checkers. It's more like three-dimensional chess. So when you look at supply versus demand, like take the UK, for instance, where uber is now providing benefits to the drivers while giving them flexibility, they're cost have gone up, but then other costs have gone down in terms of actual providing, you know, looking at driver incentives, for example, they don't have to provide as many. And so they're attracting probably more drivers now, passing on some of the cost of their customers, but competition has followed. So you're getting a little bit of that network benefit, I think. How it plays out in the US is going to be on a region by region basis. But generally speaking, I think the companies have going to manage through this and continue to march towards ebic goggles where they've been set, like at Lyft and Uber. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Steven Fox. Thanks so much for the time today, Steve. Thank you. A major head count reduction is reportedly on the horizon for Intel. Thousands of employees are expected to be laid off, according to Bloomberg. It's the chip maker looks to take cost-cutting measures. Yeah, we'll finance this Dan Hally, going to join us now for the deta. And we're going to go to Dan after the break here. We'll be right back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,12,2022-10-12 14:40:52
3103," Music Welcome back everyone. A major head count reduction reported on the horizon for Intel. Thousands of employees expected to be laid off according to Bloomberg as the chipmaker looks to take cost-cutting measures. Yahoo! Finances, Dan Howley joins us now to share the details with us. Dan, what do we know so far? It looks like we're going to see potentially thousands of layoffs at Intel. The company is basically struggling with slowing demand in the PC market, not just slowing sales across the board when it comes to things like servers, just as we started to see interest rates rise. And that's impacting its bottom line. And so there could be as many as thousands of these kinds of layoffs. The company also is dealing with those kinds of repeated slowdown that we've seen in the PC market. Gartner had said that the market actually collapsed 19.5% in Q3 2022. So it really doesn't look great for Intel at this point. Other chip companies are dealing with the same issues. But Intel is at this point kind of trying to turn itself around. They said that they're going to build that huge mega complex in Ohio. It's not going to look good for employees that they're getting laid off. It does look like the departments are going to be something along the lines of marketing and sales. And the company does have more than 100,000 employees. So it's not as though it's clearing house by any stretch of the imagination, but it could be as many as 10% 20% of employees. Yeah, and obviously this is part of the moves that we've been seeing by many of the chip makers. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors officially approved XPO logistics plan separation of its freight brokerage business. The company also named a new CFO. I had the chance to speak to the company's current CEO and founder, Brad Jacobs, about the restructuring at the company. I'm here at the Greenwich Economic Forum with Brad Jacobs, the founder and CEO of XPO logistics, although not for much longer. Brad is great to see you in person. And I say not for much longer, of course, because the company is spinning off RXO, which is logistics business. You just announced what that's effective on November 1st, I believe. So talk to me about what's happening now, what the process feels like, and what investors can expect from the two companies. It's very exciting. After 10 months of working really hard with large number of people working long hours, we're this close to the spin. And we'll create two separate companies that will be an inch wide and a mile deep in what they do. And therefore, they're likely to do it much better. So we'll have a pure play less than truck load business. That'll be XPO. And we'll have a pure play non-asset truck brokerage business called RXO, which is best in class truck broker. So it's very exciting. And you're not going to be running the day-to-day business any longer. Do you have some plans yet for what the next thing, the next Brad Jacobs chapter is going to be yet? Well, I want to try to repeat what I've done before, which is to have companies that over a 10-year period or so create at least 10 times return on the initial capital. And so I'm not a private equity firm in trying to make two or three X. And that's not my game. I go for things that are 20X, 30X, the big ones. So I'm looking for that. I'm looking for the next big thing. And where any hints of what in what industry or where you think the opportunities are, especially right now, it's tricky time, right? It's the best time. Just start a business when valuations are low and it's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about where the economy is going and so forth. That's when you want to get it. That's when you want to buy. When valuations are reasonable and there's not a lot of competition. But I don't know. I'm still gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,13,2022-10-12 14:45:16
3104," I don't know. I'm still gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking before now about all of the negativity that we're hearing, right? From Redalio to Jamie Dimon, the IMF cutting, it's GDP forecast. Altruid Jones and all of it. Yeah, all of it. I mean, you have a really good figure on the pulse of what's going on in the economy because of moving things around. So what do you see? So I don't always get it right. I often get it right, but not half a percent of the time. My take is we're probably, so when you see all these really great minds that will come out and universally say, oh, it's really bad coming up. That's usually historically been the final pre-capitulation phase. So everyone agrees that, oh, it's really bad. And then you have the final plunge. That's the time to buy when everybody said, oh, it's down this, it's going to keep going down more. That's the time to do it. So I'm really having my antennas up for it because I don't think I don't think this downturn, which is likely to happen, is going to last for a long time. And don't forget, there's two things. There's the economy and there's the market. Yes. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see, so the capitulation you're talking about is the market. In the market. Yes, the economy might lag that. Yeah, economy could lag. As the trade's go up, as quantitative tightening gets tighter, you could see a significant slowing in the economy. But the world has become such a small world and so well informed and so many people understand economics now. It didn't turn the great financial crisis. I don't think it will last long. I think there'll be such pressure to, okay, now we reduced inflation. Okay, now let's get some growth going again. I don't expect a long, long downturn. I expect a short, maybe significant downturn. Now, one of the things that was a detail in the latest jobs report made me think of you. And that had to do with trucker jobs, which fell by 11,000 in the month of September. And I'm just curious what that tells us. The number of truckers hired, I should say, fell by 11,000. A metric that we watch very closely, Julie, is for every truck driver posting that we post, how many people apply for it. That's about 45% just in the last several months. So there's a lot more people coming back into the job market as the economy gets a little tougher. So there's the pendulum is swinging on that. It's don't get me wrong. It's still very tough to hire truck drivers. It's a lot less tough than it was even a few months ago. The inventory climbs that we are seeing by a lot of not just the retailers, but in other industries as well. How is that affecting your business and the loads of things that you guys are trucking around? Well, the transportation business does better. The industry is a whole when inventory is a low, not high. There's more restocking and there's more goods being moved. But what you see right now is really interesting. As a result of all the craziness of the pandemic, people got the wrong, they have a lot of inventory, but it's often the wrong inventory. They have too much of this and too little of that. So there's still a lot of activity. So goods are still flowing. Goods are still flowing, but not as much as more. Not as much. But it's an interesting dichotomy. You observe the same thing. I observe today at the Greenwich Economic Forum. It's pretty down beat. I'm sure you die. People have their warrior face design. When you talk to my echo chambers a little bit different, my echo chamber is CEOs of large companies. They're not as large companies, entrepreneurs or small businesses who need their goods move. And they're not as negative. They're not as positive as they were say a year ago. They're less positive, but they're generally growing. They're not contracting. They're just growing less. All right. I have one final fun question for you. The Tesla semi. How much is that going to change the trucking industry? It depends on the price point. So we're a partner to one of the big OEMs for their electric vehicle semis. And actually we call them semis. The semis. The CUS be semi conductor semis. The CUS be semi conductor semis. And we call them semis. Sorry. No, we're talking about that. But the semis are, they're beautiful and the truck drivers love them and they're slick and they're well designed and they accelerate fast and they're safe and they've all kinds of gizziness in them. But they're really expensive. And so the economics aren't there yet. If the economic, if the technology advanced.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,14,2022-10-12 14:49:45
3105," They accelerate fast and are safe. They've all kinds of gizmos in them. But they're really expensive. And so the economics aren't there yet. Now, if the technology advances and the manufacturing processes advances such that they become cost effective, yet can be very transformative. Makes sense. All right, Brad Jacobs of XBO, thank you so much. It was great to see you in person. Really appreciate it. Pleasure to mind. Thanks. So it was fun there because Brad was sort of an antidote to a lot of the darkness. I mean, he's not saying everything is wonky-dorian, fantastic. But part of it is the force of his personality. Part of it is what he's seeing on the ground. He was a little bit of a counterbalance to some of the worst-case scenarios that we're hearing out there. You say tomato. I say tomato. Yeah, exactly. That means it's every time I say tomato. It was interesting to what he said, though, about the Tesla semi-truck. It's going to be fascinating when those trucks eventually hit the road. Because at some point, it sets a stage for driverless semi-trucks in this country. Yes, but as he said, the price has to come down. Absolutely. It's going to make sense, which makes sense. Right. Also a critical time for the business, given the spin-off that's moving forward and Drew Wilkerson is going to be the new CEO of that spin-off. And he had, even in this most recent earnings period, talked about how the company has a long track record of growing gross profit even through economic cycles. And they're confident right now. They're going to continue to do it. I, for one, can't wait to see what Brad is going to do next. The next thing he's going to tackle. It's tough to see him leave this industry. He is this industry.

3106," Welcome back everyone. Starting for a cup of time, three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. Elon Musk really capitalizing on his last name with a fragrance launch via his infrastructure business, the boring company. Yes, the same company that sold the flame thrower is now bringing you burnt hair for just $100 here. Okay, so $100 new perfume from Elon Musk. I don't know if I'm a buyer on this. We've already talked about how well. I'm a big buyer. I'm all, I want to be a buyer. I want to smell like sweat, success, and money. And maybe that's in this bottle. I'm down. Sign me up for a hundred dollars. Boom, done. In. I want it. I actually do. I want to try it. I love clones. This goes back to when I was a child. This isn't joke thing. Do you think it's actually going to smell good? I think it's going to smell good. I'm bullish on it. Everything that the boring company has sold has basically been subtype of joke, whether it's short shorts or whether it's flame throwers. But it's more here. The flame thrower at least worked. I would have to imagine the smells somewhat kind of. I think it smells because it doesn't actually smell like burnt hair. I would say Tom Ford smells a little burnt. The pen is one you get and he spent like $300 on it. I mean, your figure is going to know some of the best scientists in the world. So somebody's got a good chemical equation perhaps out there for the best selling you're not getting this to hobby, Julie. You're not getting this to hobby. No. Not getting it to hobby. Okay.

I love me, some Christmas and holiday season eggnog. I'm just confused why this took 20 plus years to get to the market. This is great. I love it. 40 proof. 40 proof. I mean, look, we need more. We need more toasty 40 proof eggnog out there. We're going to get ham. We're going to get ham right here. Do you know? No. No. No. No. I'm not getting any money from Kellogg. I don't need to know. I'm just pro eggnog. We already know what you make. I like it. Eggnog is good. I found you a eggnog on the market already. I'm not sure what makes this eggnog any different from the better than any other eggnog. I mean, this is like a ready to drink cocktail drink. Right. That exists. Does not exist already. Except this eggnog in eggnog. Like, it's really hard to buy a thing of eggnog and pour some rum in it. We just taste like waffle. It's already done for you. It's like what Cardi B did with the whip shots for us. Like, we already knew we were whipped cream. We already knew we liked shots. And then we had whip shots. Now we've got eggnog. I think it's a long take. What's the next one? Let's talk about something else to drink Starbucks. It's taking us for a awards program to new heights through a partnership with Delta Airlines. The coffee roaster is going to give app users 150 stars and 500 miles for linking accounts. Double stars and days flying with Delta and one mile per dollar spend. Good, more miles that you can't do anything with fabulous. Sorry. Are you expecting a tone for me to make eggnog? I'm feeling a little skeptical. I'm really thinking. I'm just going to use these for awards to get that eggo eggnog. So I'm excited about it. No, it doesn't go that way. It goes the other way. So I can't use eggnog. Am I misunderstanding this? I'm not understanding this. It's the Starbucks points towards Delta. Okay, here's the details. 150 stars, 500 miles when you link those accounts. Okay. So you get the double stars on Delta travel days. So like if you buy a Starbucks when you're flying on Delta at the airport, you get more stars. And you get one mile per one dollar spend at Starbucks. I have to add a special code and concur. Like, can I use this and concur? I feel like what I need right now is that GIF with like the guy with the calculations on the board behind him to figure out exactly how to do that. It's still better than Duncan. It's still better than what Duncan did this week. I'm still waiting to get my free coffee. I think I have 600 more points to go. It's terrible. I mean, but Starbucks has had one of the better rewards out there. And for the companies that have done more digital disruption for that customer touchpoint, I mean, Starbucks. All these companies should just copy Starbucks. Why try to reinvent any of the Starbucks? People love their rewards program. It's a huge driver of their business. Let's take a look at markets.

It's good to have you in person I absolutely I know I feel like we know each other. Yeah, yeah, yeah, first time we went Pretty fitting right we're talking about earning season the bar is pretty low going into this, but you see Set yourself up for even more disappointment. I do I really see them the market is hitting about 3432 I mean Pepsi don't surprise on the upside So if it maybe that's that's a little bit of an indicator that expectations have come low enough that that we but we have the dollar I mean the dollar was such a headwind in in Q3 and I think you've got a lot of tech companies that are gonna struggle So who's gonna do well probably the energy companies? We will probably see industrials do okay. We've seen some you know energy companies are gonna continue to print money here at $80 or $90 barrel oil So I think the sectors are gonna matter individual company performance is gonna matter and what their CEOs did But I think it's like you got to check a box on what EPS is But I think more so everybody wants to know guidance What does this look like going forward how much pressure is it gonna happen with the dollar? Who's doing job cuts? I mean it's expected intel is gonna announce job cuts to follow Microsoft follow snap You know, so we're seeing a lot of job cuts cutting in the technology sector Definitely nervous going to full earning season financials really kick it off and we'll see did they pick up net interest in Commer they having to put too many reserves not seeing any mortgages You know we've definitely seen the mortgages almost grind to a halt and then investment banking has been just difficult this year So banks may startle yeah, so the four looking statements are what we're looking for going into these results But also you know, it seems to be still a bit of a debate if you could argue that that you know Where exactly we are in terms of the macro picture you have those comments coming in from president Biden saying that he doesn't Expect a recession. Obviously he's the president. He's not gonna say things are gonna get worse But we also got those comments from Jamie Dimon, which seems to suggest there are more rough patches ahead How do you view that so I think the fact the president said the R word, you know if you're a a Fan of the the show West Wing with a bagel word, you know that nobody wants to say the R word is bagel time But the fact the president is acknowledging it might be a slight recession That has to mean they're even acknowledging the slowdown is coming the feds acknowledges the slowdown is coming They're trying to slow it down to slow down inflation. I'm with Jamie Dimon I actually think we're in a recession I know we can argue the definition of recession and that's technically never's job But if you look at the slowdown where we're going with growth What's happening with inflation? What's happening with the hawkish fed? Definitely on Jamie Dimon's that there's a little more pain coming not sure I'm full. I am out for right They came out with like hey expect another 20% down like this. There's more pain coming Everybody's gonna feel recession in 23 feel like that might be a tad draconian at this point But I do think we're still gonna see the effects remember the lag between rate hikes and when we feel in the labor market It's about 12 months So the question is you know, where do you position yourself if that slowdown is already underway You've been bullish on energy for quite some time and you know There's there's questions right now especially with the moves on that we saw from OPEC last week about Whether things are really going to start to take up and we have seen them take up a little Where are you positioned in some of those big names sure we we did actually pull a little bit back to energy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,18,2022-10-12 15:06:59
3109," to speak about whether things are really going to start to take up. And we have seen them take up a little. Where are you positioned in some of those big names? Sure. We did actually pull a little bit back to energy, but we're still overweight. We were very, very overweight. We pulled that back a little bit in June, but we still like a lot of it. So we like the U.S. EMPs, right? The, to get it out of the ground in the Permian area is about $30, $40 a barrel. And you haven't seen the, the rig count really jump up. We're at 765 total rigs.

And there are some big sanctions coming in December from the EU, and it's going to hit the shipping and the tankers, because they're not going to insure them. And if nobody's insuring an oil cargo, which like I believe something like 95% of insurance is issued by the UK in the Euro area. So I see opportunity in U.S. energy producers. We liked our Devon, you know, Diamondback announced the acquisition today. We really like the Shaneer. It's a natural gas exporter. We think the gas story, because we feel like the story of energy security for the next decade. Yes, EVs are coming, yes, solar's coming. Have we hit peak oil demand? We'll see. But we also see also the slit that we need people buying energy from allies. You know, when we're dealing with that with Saudi Arabia right now, that is Saudi Arabia really an ally, or to sound like millennial self. Are they a friend of me? Like we're friends with them a little bit. But in reality, we're not really. And if you look at the geopolitical macro view, you have maimed your players that we may have massive political shifts in. We have Saudi Arabia. We have Iran. And we have Venezuela. And we're slightly not saying this is a grand decision and picking sides here, but we're slightly warming up to Venezuela, because we realize how to Arabia really is not working on our best interests right now. Yeah, I mean, we did hear the President comment on the yesterday suggesting that there could be more moves coming against Saudi Arabia on the back of that decision. So energy, it sounds like you're still, you pulled back a bit, but you're still positive on it in this environment. Yeah. What are some other names that you think are getting overlooked right now that offer real value? So, and my Costco, I'll talk about Costco anytime I can get it. I love my Costco. Not the stock itself. I'm talking about the company. But not even the $1.50 hotdog, but they are also picking up inventory. So this second Amazon Prime Day that we've gotten is not just because Amazon is trying to be nice to us. They're trying to dump inventory. Everybody's got inventory. Nike's got inventory. So the Costco's and the TJ Maxx of the world that are kind of the off brand. They're not beholden to any brand names. So they're picking up cheap inventory and they're moving it. They're a discount store. They're 75% in the US. The bulk of their international exposures, Canada, which is held up better. So I think they're going to have a little bit less currency effects. I like them. I like a really boring name, IBM. I think they're a great place to hide. They've got a strong dividend yield. I think as a service and a tech company goes tech spending, it's going to continue. And because of the way they're positioned, I think they're going to see a little bit more sustainability and revenues. Because that's what we're looking at right now. As we move forward and things get pressured, who's going to still make money and who's at risk of being cut? And so I think they're very well positioned. They're reasonably valued. But I think they still have a lot of growth. They've changed who they were. And people realize IBM is a very old company, but they've redeveloped themselves multiple, multiple times. They sold off Lenovo, got out of the PC business. And now they're in the hybrid cloud and AI and data consulting. And I see data and data and healthcare as a great place to be. And the last place playing defense is healthcare, like a United Health. Great name to be in right now. And again, a little bit less effect with the dollar. So some of these names that have more revenues coming from the US, I think also will hold up a little bit better. Yeah, names from three very different sectors. But diversification is what we keep hearing. Victoria Green, good to have you in studio today. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. Joining us from G-Scrider Private Wealth. Well, let's take a look at oil now as OPEC flashes its forecast for global crude demand. Yahoo Finance is Jared Blyckrey here with more on the price action. Jared, I guess in some ways, this is OPEC's wave justifying that cut that we got last week. I think so. That took the administration also, the Democrats by surprise. In fact, a lot of people surprised by that because a slash of 2.1 million barrels per day is a lot. Now, OPEC Plus has been operating under capacity. So it's really only an effective cut of about 1 million barrels per day. That is still a lot. And it has house Democrats up in arms and some of the Senate leaders as well, Dick Durbin, offering up some bills that have been offered previously in the year and these have to do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,19,2022-10-12 15:11:31
3110," Up in arms and some of the Senator, Senate leaders as well, Dick Durbin offering up some bills that have been offered previously in the year. And these have to do with the potential altering the relationship that the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia. We know the U.S. just visited. President Biden just visited Saudi Arabia. But all of this is one month ahead of the midterm. So we know how gas prices and energy prices factor into politics. So not surprised to see this, but I believe there is a resolution introduced by three Democrats that would suspend military operations and protections in Saudi Arabia and also some sales of arms. And that's a huge deal. There's $100 billion in active tickets with respect to the U.S. and defense systems out there with respect to Saudi Arabia. Now here are crude oil futures. In today, you can see just kind of sinking here after the 8 AM hour. But here's a year to date. We just climbed above 91 dollars per barrel, but still well in the lower end of this range. We just broke out. And so with energy as the leading sector here, you got to ask yourself, and I'm going to go to our sector action and put a year to date on it. With energy, the leading sector, what are the options here? Victoria Green, our previous guest, mentioning that a lot of these companies, these energy companies are minting money. And with respect to the supply situation of Saudi Arabia isn't playing ball. Guess what, Venezuela. She mentioned them too. They have some of the largest holdings of oil reserves in the entire world. And they are on this side of the world in the West. So maybe we're going to see some increase in terms of interest with respect to repairing those foreign relations. And maybe easing some of those sanctions. I believe Chevron still has a presence there. So we'll have to see what comes of this. Ex-L.E., by the way, still up 43% for the year. Okay, Jared Blickrey, thanks so much for that. Well, Pepsi, PepsiCo seeing a big boost after the food giant blew away profit estimates with Frito-Lay, North America powering PepsiCo's net revenue. Take a look at the stock there, up nearly 5%. The company also raising its forecast, now expecting its full year organic revenue to increase 12%. We've got our very own Brian Sasi here with outfit change from the last hour. I just put it up please. This is my outfit I watch on Sunday football. You know, I feel a little Pepsi Max, but I'm both in box and ice and you're good to go. Which is fitting because we're talking about snacks. Turns out snacks are pretty resilient even in the face of cost rises. Yeah, you know, I don't want to bury the lead here. Bottom line is we talk to PepsiCo, CFO, Hugh Johnson, he said, hey, yeah, we'll find it steam. We're pushing through price increases because we're still dealing with high levels of inflation. And despite those price increases, people are still out there buying lots of chips and lots of soda. Take a listen. Okay, I guess we don't have that. We don't have that, but still, Johnson came out, really I think struck a bullish tone. So in addition to that, really saying how he, they just implemented more price increases in the fourth quarter. What he did not want to do is really provide any 2023 guidance. That is typically what PepsiCo does. He did not provide that on the conference call, but ultimately said that's not where they're going to go yet too. We were just also showing pictures of Gatorade. I would expect a big push by Gatorade more into the energy drink category next year. They will launch that what they're calling their new fast Twitch product, 200 milligrams of caffeine in the early part of next year in partnership with the NFL. That should be the case. 200 milligrams of... Oh, right on my alley. I'm so psyched to get a walk out. You're going to have more than one of those, right? Oh, you better go. Oh, absolutely. When you talk about those cost increases, how much of it is it to offset? I mean, it's clearly there to offset the price increases they're seeing internally from the materials, everything that goes into making all these stacks, but at the same time, is it enough to offset what they're seeing internally? Yeah, I would say they have. Pepsi was out here this morning with, I think in earnings, be nobody on the street expected. That's why the stock is ripping higher here for Pepsi on earnings. They, that's a pretty big move. That's why it's the hottest ticker on the Yow Finance platform. This quarter's positively surprised a lot of folks on the street over the next coming days. I would not be surprised to see upgrades on Pepsi co-stock, upgrades in price targets, upgrades in earnings estimates because it's clear that they have pricing power. And I think the focus now turns onto Coca-Cola to see if they could report more of the same. First instinct is yes, you will probably see a very strong quarter from Coca-Cola. The only red flag I would call out is maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola than Pepsi-Cola, but still Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong quarter now. Yeah, currency exposure, one, we're going to continue a year throughout the earnings season.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,20,2022-10-12 15:15:49
3111," Flag I would call out as maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola and Pepsi code but still Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong core now. Yeah, currency exposure one we're going to continue to hear throughout the earnings season. Brian Sasi, thanks so much. Thanks. Well, shares of Intel aren't focused today as the company reportedly considers major job cuts. That stock is up right now but it did hit a new 52-week low today. Bloomberg reporting the chipmaker plans to announce the reductions around its quarterly results on October 27th. News of the cuts come as the company sees declining demand for its products especially its PC processors. It's a key revenue driver for the company. Bloomberg reports the reductions could be as high as 20% of staff in some divisions. Well coming up from changing our office to watching the office meta labels the QuestPro a powerful device for productivity and announces tie-ups with Microsoft and NBC universal. Dan Halle is going to break down the announcement for us on the other side. Well meta has unveiled its new virtual reality headset with a price tag and I watering $1,500. The device isn't aimed at gamers it's being more positioned as a work use tool. Those credentials bolster by an appearance from Microsoft's very own CEO Satya Nadella at the big event. Yaku finances Dan Halle has all of the details Dan I guess you could argue the device is a little less clunkyer but let's talk about the technology and how this helps meta accelerate their vision of the metaverse. Does it though I don't know if it does this is a $1,500 headset it's really geared towards professionals you know as you said it's not really geared towards gamers although part of the conference or you know the developers conference that they were running had a huge focus on gamers and how",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,21,2022-10-12 15:19:42
3112," professionals, as you said, it's not really here towards gamers, although part of the conference or the developer's conference that they were running had a huge focus on gamers and how they want to bring more game developers in and talk about how they're offering more in that game developers are making billions or rather millions through the platform. So they really did put that heavy emphasis on gaming. The headset, though, as you said, seemed to be focused more on the idea of work and being able to have these kind of meetings in the metaverse where you can sit down with people from around the world and easily chat without having to do it via video conference, which I'm not sure that too many people will find that super appealing when they have to strap a headset on that is heavier than the current quest, albeit according to people who've used it a little bit better weighted and less hot. So it really was kind of a mixed bag. The technology is supposed to be better with better visuals, pedographics, improved lenses. There's the ability to see the outside world in color. You could do that sort of with the quest, too, but not really with full color at all. So yeah, it really does ring to be seen if this is actually going to start pushing the metaverse idea forward. It still seems like it's quite a ways off before it becomes something that the average consumer says, I got to go out and get this headset and then use it all the time because they've sold something like 10 million headsets or more, but how often are they being used? I think the real question, how often are people picking them up, going back daily and jumping into things like check email, talk to people, access kind of the big displays that you might get in the metaverse. When instead you could just fire a computer and do that quicker. Yeah, I mean, it is about that transition we talked about so much. It's not so seamless going from the real world to the virtual world, although I have to say, Dan, I'm just really excited that Avatar's getting lights. You can talk about that. I mean, that's a good sign, right? Technology's advancing. We talked about Satya Nadella making a surprise appearance there. What's this partnership about between meta and Microsoft? Yeah, so this is about their team's mesh software and it's really, you know, they're both going hard as far as the ability to get this kind of work into the metaverse where you can sit down and have meetings with people chat with them around a virtual conference table. You know, Microsoft already offers a team's chat where you can do video chatting with your colleagues through your laptop or your smart phone. So, you know, it just kind of feels odd that you can fire up something so easily that you can carry with you and have conversations with people. Sure, you're not around a virtual conference table. You're not able to virtually whiteboard the way you might want to, although there is a whiteboard feature for video chatting with Microsoft teams when you do use the laptop. But, you know, it does kind of point to how both companies don't want to miss the boat. It could potentially be a big piece of hardware and software down the line just like they did with the smartphone. You'll remember Facebook tried to launch a phone. Microsoft had their phone line, Windows OS, mobile OS wasn't as bad as people thought. But they also did lean into gaming. So part of Microsoft's X Cloud, their cloud gaming platform will be available on the quest. And so you see this kind of balance between or attempt to balance between gamers and people who are working. It feels as though they're trying to make a PC when the PC already exists. This one you just have to put on your head. All this of course coming is a medic kind of keeps a close watch in their rearview mirror, right? With Apple, it's expected to come out with their headset soon. Dan Halley is always thanks so much for that. We are continuing to monitor some of those layoffs coming out of Warner Brothers Discovery. This is all part of the company's drive to cut costs. It's now affecting the Warner Brothers TV studio. Yahoo! Finance is Ali Canal following that story for us. And Ali, do we have a sense of just how many job cuts are coming? Yeah, we do. Yesterday we got the announcement that the TV studio has been affected. That segment cut 26% of its head count, aka 125 positions across scripted, unscripted, and animation. And that translated to 82 staffers being laid off. And then the company opted not to fill an additional 43 vacant positions. But there's another big cut that the company made. They are shuttering their digital production arms, stage 13. And the 40 year Warner Brothers television workshop. And this is a big one because this fostered new diverse talent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,22,2022-10-12 15:24:13
3113, me they are shuttering their digital production arms stage 13 and the 40 year Warner Brothers television workshop and this is a big one because this fostered new diverse talent there was a lot of talk on Twitter why are they deciding to cut this when there was so much diversity that was coming out of that program so that is now done and obviously this comes at a pretty crucial time for the company they are trying to cut three billion dollars worth of costs over the next two years we saw back in August that they cut 14% of their HBO Max work for so this is just a continuation of those expected layoffs I think we will see more throughout the fall but if you take a look at the stock it's trading near 52 week lows down more than 50% year-to-date David Sazal has been very aggressive but I think investors are they still need a buying to his vision so I think once all this consolidation happens once we get that newly combined HBO Max discovery plus streaming program next summer the next step is going to be okay David Sazal where are you going to take this company and well investors ultimately buy into it yeah maybe investors are waiting for the shakedown to all play out the other company of course in the streaming space Netflix the big giant here reporting next week what are we expecting there what's interesting about this earnings report is for the first time in a long time I don't think subscriber numbers are going to be the be all and all if we take a look at the numbers here Netflix says it expects revenue at 7.85 billion adjusted EPS at two dollars and 22 cents a share they expect that subscriber number to come in at one million I actually think they might even be on that subscriber number due to the success of Dahmer that series has just been crushing it week after week on the Netflix top 10 list but going back to what's happening at the company right now at supported that is going to be a big driver there's been a lot of optimism on Wall Street we've seen a lot of upgrades the stock is up 18% over the past three months widely outpacing the broader market we still have a couple bears in there that say there's a lot of volatility there's a lot of competition we have Disney's at supported coming out in December people are saying that Netflix could come out with theirs November 1st to beat Disney to the punch but right now I think ultimately analysts are really hoping for some more clarity on the at supported and they're really banking on that to help Netflix improve their free cash flow and profitability so that's going to be probably the biggest question that investors want answered during the earnings call in the report you think that people be a little more cautious in this environment in terms of you know which advertisers would be willing to pay up but I guess that points to the attractiveness of the platform that at least you know the analysts see if they're upgrading it because the additional revenue source they expect to come in and that's been some of the bearer sentiment too because Netflix is charging a really high premium for too a lot of these advertisers so if they even want to be on the platform they're paying above industry standard and that could be a risk. Yeah an important point to point out there Ali Canal thanks so much for that. Well coming up the sustainability conundrum support for major governments trillions worth of assets and now a new report saying supply cannot keep up with the band but is their backlash against ESG we'll discuss next.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,23,2022-10-12 15:28:26
3114," Fifth In the time now for our chart of the day and today we are focusing on the rise in ESG investing. And as an investor may come as a surprise, the sum that the field is actually known for sustainable debt, which has been increasing. So much so that in 2021, issuance exceeded 1.6 trillion, take a look at this chart here. The fastest growing themes in the ESG fixed income market were sustainability, linked bonds and loans. These transactions bring the total market to more than 4 trillion since inception. That's at least according to data out from Bloomberg. Well, we're sticking with the ESG investing theme here. A new study by PWC found that nearly 9 and 10 institutional investors believe that asset managers should be more proactive in developing new ESG products. But fewer than half of asset managers were planning to launch new ESG funds. So what's an investor to do? Joining us now is Bruce Usher, a Columbia Business School professor, an author of the new book, investing in the era of climate change and Bruce, you've been arguing that despite the economic backdrop, this is kind of the time to be investing in some of these green names. Walk me through that thesis. Absolutely. It's really about the macro trends, climate change. We know climate science. We know that after 300 years of building a global economy that's putting emissions into the atmosphere, we've got 30 years to decarbonize to avoid catastrophic climate change. So you've got consumers pushing to buy more sustainable goods. You've got employees saying they want to work for sustainable companies. You now have investors looking at those trends. Company leaders saying we need to meet those trends. You have government action, like the inflation reduction act, pouring support into this. And lastly, a physical risk of climate change manifesting themselves. More violent storm, heat waves. All these macro trends are all pushing the same direction. They're going to be with us for decades to come. How do you break that down, though, for investors who are looking at this and saying, well, OK, there's questions about yes, she funds and we'll get into that in just a bit. But in terms of the names, there's, you know, EVs, which some would argue that that's actually not a long term play in terms of impact on climate change. There are many other names that may be potentially being overlooked. Right. So when I looked at this sector 20 years ago, it's how long I've been in it. The big challenge then was there was nothing to invest in. If you look at the whole solar power market, everything globally, there's less solar than one coal plant. Last year, the investment in solar, more than 100 coal plants worth, and gaining. So the big picture here is that the opportunity to invest is now trillion-dollar sectors. We've got the EV sector. All the automakers are going EVs. The key question is why? The reason is that those products are better than the incumbent product there's other before. So you look at EVs specifically, it suggests, but that why the EV sales so good? Because consumers love them. Consumers prefer EV products that flying out the showrooms, in fact, the car makers can't keep up with them. They prefer the products, but it's still a very small portion. Right? He paid about 5%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,24,2022-10-12 15:33:17
3115," for EV products that flying out the showrooms, in fact, the car makers can't keep up with them. They prefer the products, but it's still a very small portion, right? We're talking roughly what, 5%, but now analysis has shown that around 5%, you get a tipping point in these markets. And that's what the automakers are seeing. You have to ask why are they all rushing into this market? What do they see? What they see is five years ahead. When they're planning new cars, they're looking five years in the future. That's how long it takes to roll out a new model. And what they see is an all-of-evee future, because it's a better product, consumers like it. And then we have these trends around climate change. So that's what's really pushing that. And that's what's creating investment opportunities. When consumers and businesses go in this direction, the market opens up to investors. We have seen incredible amount of inflows into ESG funds over the last few years. A bit of a reckoning, some of our you that's happening right now, not just this being politicized, but you've also got those like Deutsche Bank, some other names who are now being called out for greenwashing, the funds that the names that were included in these funds were not necessarily sort of green, so to speak. What do you think? I mean, what do you think is happening here? How does this manifest itself from an investor perspective, those who've been putting money behind these saying they were anticipating some impact coming from these funds? Well, turns out that's not actually what ESG investing is, right? That's correct. Exactly. And there's a real misunderstanding around ESG. ESG investing is really very simple. It's saying, look, when I look at potentially investing in asset, I look at financial numbers, I look at management, I look at all these things. And then also, to be a smarter investor, what else could put this investment at risk? What else could change the outcomes? Look at risks like flooding or hurricanes or wildfires. How could that affect my investment? If you wouldn't go out by a house, a second home on the coast, would you want to know if it's going to flood? Would you want to know that be a smart thing to know? That's what ESG investing is. It can make you a better business manager, it can make you a better investor. The challenge though, is it doesn't really address climate change. Just because you buy that, just because you're deciding on a walk away from that house, so I'm going to pay less for it because it's at flood risk, that doesn't reduce the risk of flooding. That's a challenge. So how do you invest from an impact standpoint? So from impact standpoint, it's much more important that you go beyond ESG investing. And there's really two strategies that I read about my book. One is what we call thematic. So pick a theme that you're excited about your comfort with. If you're really interested in renewable energy, invest in the solar or wind fund. There's plenty of those out there. That's a way to really channel money into the solution. Or if you're interested in EVs into either EV company stocks or funds, those are thematic funds. There's also now new funds coming out in green hydrogen, other leading technologies. So you can have a thematic focus, the equity debt venture capital, as you wish. Or you can have what we call impact first focus. Now this is very special in the sense that it's really only for high net worth investors. Impact first is not falling if I do share responsibility. It's saying, I really want to address climate change. I'm going to put my capital into that. I might get a return. Their return might be decades from now. But it's going to have great impact. And that's where you're really investing. And technologies aren't yet commercial. This goes well beyond say solar and EVs. This is some new technologies like direct air capture, for example. And really quickly, what about green bonds? So green bonds are issued by companies because they see these trends coming. They see these sustainability trends. Consumers want investors want it. It's again thinking about how is how is they world be carbonizing? And what does that mean for my business? The green bond makes perfect sense. But again, the green bond is not going to have tremendous impact on the environment. It's just a very sensible investment. Okay. Good to differentiate those two. Bruce Esther, Columbia Business School professor and author of the book, Investing in the era of climate change. Thanks for joining us today. Thank you. Well, coming up, talking down gold comments from Janet Yellen on the dollar and Loretta Mester on rate hike. So aren't exactly supporting the precious metal. As the safe and shine truly rubbed off, we're going to ask our next guest on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,25,2022-10-12 15:37:19
3116," Next We'll do a quick check on the commodity space right now and looking specifically at oil. We are seeing both WTI crude and Brent crude to the downside. WTI down about 2, more than 2% Brent crude down about 1.9 there. For more on the commodity space, let's bring in Suki Cooper, a Stan chart executive director in precious metals, analysts. Suki, good to talk to you. You've specifically been looking at gold right now. Sort of, you know, what has traditionally been more of a safe haven play, but it sounds like you think there's more downside to come. Gold has really been caught in the headwinds of the strength of the dollar and the scope of further rate hikes. And while we think that the Fed is not done with its rate hikes, I don't think there's another 75 basis points that's likely to come in an November meeting and another further 50 basis points in December. I think these are going to present strong headwinds for the gold market, but we do think that the downside is quite well supported. We're seeing quite a good price elastic response in terms of demand from India and China. And there's still that concern around the session risk and perhaps the need for flight to safety that is buffering some of the downside for gold. But we do think that there's more downside risk to come as the year comes to an end and into 2023 with the gold price is heading further towards 1600 towards the end of next year. So 1600, we're at 1675 right now. Is 1600 the support level you're talking about? The key support that's coming up next is around 1650. This is a level that we've seen physical demand materialising. And now we're entering a period where we tend to see seasonal demand from India. Devali falls on the 24th this month. We have the wedding season as well. And we've seen in markets like China, the physical premium earlier last month's long to levels that we last saw in 2015. So that price drop that we initially saw below 1700 was greeted by quite strong physical interest in the gold market. So the next level to look at from here will be 1650 and then beyond that is 1600. If we breach those two levels, then we're really looking to the cost of production and where that provides a guideline for the gold market. And we tend to see in a long run basis and here I'm looking at around about 40 years that gold prices tend to trade a third above the average cost of production. And that guideline suggests to us around 1550 to 16.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,26,2022-10-12 15:41:56
3117," I'm looking at around about 40 years, that gold prices tend to trade a third above the average cost of production. And that guideline suggests to us around 1550 to 1600 is where that floor from the production side should be sterilized. So much of the price moves as you point out, really driven by the stronger dollar and we have seen it climb up again today looking at something like the Japanese yen well above or below depending on how you look at it, those intervention levels. I mean, how much higher do you think the green bag goes as you track those metals and moving in tandem? It's really pivotal for the communist complex as a whole. The dollar strength has been a headwind for not just gold, but for silver, platinum and playdium. It's really dampened that upside risk. We think that there's likely that we may see further dollar strength and perhaps we'll see something of a stabilization coming in the first part of next year. And that's really when we might see some of that pressure on gold prices starting to ease. But if we look at the correlations for the gold markets, it's strongest consistent. Relationships since the start of this year has been with the US dollar. That correlations jump in above 60% at the moment. But last year that relationship had started to pivot towards real yields and nominal yields. That relationship still matters for gold. It's in close second. But at the moment, it's the strength of the dollar that's proven to be a key headwind. Now it's not to say that gold can't rise if we see dollar strength. If both dollar and gold are benefiting from safe Hayden demand, we can see them both rally. And in the current environment, it's the concerns around slowing demand over the longer term. But there's also concerns around higher rates that's really weighing on gold. And it's not been a critical safe Hayden demand at the moment. So bottom line, Tsukiya, you should investors be putting their money here or is there a better value in the precious metal space? If we look at the entire complex on a longer term basis, the industry bias, precious metals, fundamentals are set to tighten. If we look at markets like platinum and pladium, we think that towards the end of the year, we're going to see much tighter markets. As the auto market starts to recover, we were anticipating at the start of this year, a rebound around about 11% in global auto production. But we've scaled back our expectations closer to 7%. But into 2023, we're still expecting the double-digit rebounds in terms of global auto production. And PGMs are critical in terms of the growth that we see in the auto industry. So those are two markets where we expect more off-side risk towards the end of this year. But on a longer term horizon, perhaps silver is the metal where we might see more upside risk and given the demand from the solar energy, given the electrification of vehicles, this is strong growth that we're looking to see. But that demand is like to take two to three years to materialise. So over the longer run, silver has positive prospects. But over the next few months, we think there's more upside risk for platinum and pladium, at least in the short term. Suki Cooper, Stan Chart Executive Director and Precious Metals, analysts. Good to have you on today. Thank you. Well, coming up, reigning on the parade, some power announces a big move with GM on home energy storage, but a downgrade from BFA Ways on Chairs is the teeterie housing market its biggest risk. We're going to ask CEO Peter Ferrisy on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,27,2022-10-12 15:45:52
3118," Music Well, the sun shined on solar stocks in the aftermath of President Biden's landmark inflation reduction act, as it showered the sector with billions in funding and tax incentives. Now a leading player in the residential space is making a big move. The sun power announcing a major tie up with General Motors to develop new home energy systems that's going to coincide with the retail launch of the Chevy Silverado EV in 2024. Let's bring in the CEO of Sun Power, Peter Ferrisy joining us live on this show. Today Peter gets to talk to you today. It's really a big announcement here that really combines the battery side of things, the solar side of things, EVs. Talk to me about how it's all connected to the new home energy system. Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me on, but we are just thrilled to partner with General Motors. As you mentioned, our partnership has two major components that are going to be critical for the future of EV sales and for clean energy. So number one, we're preferred partner for General Motors on electric vehicle charger installations. So for all the electric vehicles they sell going forward, we'll be their preferred partner. And many customers find that it's very, this is not a do-it-yourself job. You need someone's help. To set up your own home charging station, if you will. But secondly, once you get an electric vehicle, you quickly discover your home charging station is using a lot more energy than it used to. And so most customers want solar power very quickly afterwards. And we are the exclusive partner for General Motors on solar panels and batteries. And we're just thrilled to work together on changing the world as we go forward. So you're talking about installing the solar panels on homes that are looking to get the charging installed for their GM car. Exactly. So once you buy an electric vehicle, obviously there's so many wonderful parts about it. You don't use fossil fuel at the gas station. But if you just plug into your garage and you don't have solar power, you're just connecting to usually coal or gas or whatever fossil fuel the local utility uses. So your only is green is your charging source. And so most EV customers really want solar power quickly afterwards because their bills are much higher when they go to charge their car without solar power. And with solar power, they have this clean renewable energy source forever. Peter, you know one of the big concerns with EVs has been just how it's likely to strain the power grid. And there's an idea of bidirectional charging using your car to power up your home. Certainly one that's been picking up a lot of steam. How much of that demand that's anticipated for the power grid do you think can actually be, you know, picked up by these EVs? Well you're absolutely right. By directional chargers. Wow. This has really kind of changed the world for consumers. Who would have thought that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,28,2022-10-12 15:50:19
3119," by these EVs. Well, you're absolutely right. By directional chargers. Wow, this has really kind of changed the world for consumers. Who would have thought that in addition to backing up your home with a generator, that's the way it's been done traditionally, that you can either use a solar battery or actually use your vehicle? And what General Motors has announced is that we will be installing their by directional charger for the 2024 Silverado pickup launch. It launches at the end of 23 next year. And what's exciting is that for consumers to buy a Silverado, they'll have the option to back up their home with their vehicle battery, which will just be incredible. But you're actually right. The grid today doesn't have enough capacity for all the future EV sales that we expect. General Motors is expecting to sell more than a million electric vehicles in the next three years. If you believe the data by 2030, 30 million more electric vehicles will be out there on the road. And so for practical purposes, and obviously to combat climate change, more and more consumers are going to want solar power. And we're really excited to work with them because we're the number one rated residential solar power company in the United States. We have the highest customer service, we have the best products, and we're thrilled to work with GM to serve their customers. Yeah, it's certainly the idea of by directional charging, really picking up steam, especially in light of recent natural disasters like the hurricanes, fires with a lot of home owners saying, well, this could have helped with the power outages. Obviously, GM came out with this announcement yesterday. It's certainly big news, but your stock was down significantly because of a downgrade from Bank of America, specifically setting a decline in new home sales, affecting revenue outlook. I realize sales from homes aren't specifically the biggest revenue driver for Sun Power. But how big of a pullback do you anticipate into what extent have you already seen that? Well, we are the leader in new home solar. So I recognize the origin of the comment. But what I'll tell you is that overall demand for solar, outside of new homes has been so high this year that any change in new homes demand really hasn't been material to our business. So we have a very big backlog of new homes that exist today that are waiting for solar, that'll carry us through most of 2023. So although new home starts have slowed because of rising interest rates, I don't anticipate it's going to have a bunch of an impact on our overall business. We announced that we haven't announced our third quarter result yet, obviously, but in Q1 and Q2, we actually announced accelerating demand. And this year, just to give you some color, has just been terrific from a demand standpoint. More and more consumers want solar power, and we're so excited to work with them on it. Sun Power, CEO, Peter Ferrisy. I get to have you on air today, really appreciate the time. Thank you again. Coming up, building the momentum, the critics of Amazon's labor push, they argue progress is still since the big JFK 8 win, but events in California yesterday and upstate New York today could change that. We'll discuss. Until next time, bye. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same. I'm going to do a little bit of the same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,29,2022-10-12 15:54:29
3120," 5. We'll see you next time. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Well some new momentum for Amazon's labor movement workers at a Southern California warehouse campaign in Georgia is. In Texas and Kristoff. A despite regrets Patty45? Not yet. A sharp stop to go in demand. Yet again, it highlights revenue. Amazon Labor Union's first out of state venture, and it is a big one. The Inland Empire, a local politician I've spoken to, is referred to it as warehouse central. It is deeply important for the logistics industry, and it's deeply important for Amazon. Amazon set to build its largest warehouse in the Inland Empire, and in the last 12 years has invested more than 19 billion in that area alone. So Union pushes have failed there in the past, but if the Amazon Labor Union can get this election authorized and succeed, it would be a major victory, and it would hit Amazon where it hurts the most. And Ali, we got that news yesterday in anticipation of another vote that's happening in the state of New York, Albany, a pivotal union election today. What are we expecting? So we're, you know, I've spoken to a couple experts who say, who all say the same thing, that the Amazon Labor Union does believe they could win an Albany despite their latest loss in Staten Island, and experts say that, you know, the odds are still not in their favor, but if they won, it would be a watershed event. And that, combined with the news coming out of California today and yesterday, makes means that they could really have momentum. And it's important to remember, Kiko, for workers, this is about inspiration and momentum. And for Amazon, long term time is absolutely on their side, but right now momentum certainly is not. Really quickly, Ali, have we heard from Amazon in response to the very latest out of California? Not yet, but I'll keep you abreast of what happens there. Okay, great. We'll be watching. Thanks so much for that. Ali Garfinkle joining us from our LA Bureau. Well, let's do a final check of the market action before we let you go. We're seeing green arrows now across the board. The Dow up 171 points, the S&P 500 up 15 and the Nasdaq up 50. We are, of course, looking ahead to the afternoon where we are expecting the FOMC minutes to come out. Sterling investors going to be passing that ahead of that big CPI print coming out tomorrow. All of this, of course, to look ahead to that FOMC meeting. And so you just how aggressively the Fed will continue to move in the face of high inflation. That does it for me in this hour. We've got much more to come here and yakking finance life. Let's move to the right here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,30,2022-10-12 16:00:00
3121,"something you you that gets Today are expressing negativity. We heard Jamie Dheim in yesterday expressing pessimism about where we're going. You obviously were former businessman, now Governor of Connecticut. What are you hearing from your constituents? And what are you seeing out there? Here at the Greenwich Economic Forum, I think people see some recession storm clouds on the horizon. And we're a small state. I can only control so much, but what I've got to do is make sure that a state like Connecticut is prepared. And I've done that by setting aside a $3.5 billion. So if we do get a recession, I don't have to erase taxes. I don't have to lay anybody off. I don't have to cut back on education. We're in a strong position to power through and make sure we keep our economy growing. And of course, you've gotten an influx of new tax income over the course of the pandemic, because people have been moving to Connecticut. Are those new constituents, do they have sort of different needs, different wants than the folks who were in Connecticut already? No, we had tens of thousands of young families moving to the state of Connecticut. There we go in the other direction 10 years ago. Right. I think they love great schools. They love maybe a little backyard. There's a good financial sector here here in the Granted Stanford area. I don't know if they have different needs, but I think they like the Connecticut lifestyle. And how confident are you that if there is a recession, as you just said, that you absolutely won't have to erase taxes or cut back on education or some of the things that they like about Connecticut.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,31,2022-10-12 16:03:21
3122," And how confident are you that if there is a recession as you just said that you absolutely won't have to race taxes or cut back on education or some of the things that they like about Connecticut. It depends on the nature of what those storm clouds bring. But I wouldn't trade Connecticut's place with just about anybody right now. We have a very strong manufacturing sector with five and ten year agreements with the defense industry. I have a hundred thousand jobs or having a hard time filling right now. So I don't think it's going to be an unemployment recession. I think it might be a financial recession. That impacts our revenues. I'm going to make sure we're ready. When you talk about an unemployment recession, the unemployment rate in the state is 4.1%. So higher than the national average, how high are you prepared for that to go in a state like Connecticut? I've got well over a hundred thousand jobs that are unfilled right now. I'm training people for those jobs. If everybody took those jobs, I'd be out of people because there's that many jobs to be filled. That's an advanced manufacturing. That's an IT, not the mentioned nursing and teaching. So it's a great time to be a young person, I think, in America. And certainly right here in Connecticut, we're providing all the job training you need. So you come to Connecticut. We'll get you a training and we'll get you a job. Yeah, talk to me a little bit more about those training programs. What they look like. How many people are taking advantage of them, for example. So thousands have done it. We put together. Look, some people want two-year community college, some want four-year college. A lot of people want an 18-week certificate program so they can be a laser welder with a guaranteed job at electric boat when they're done. And so we're providing you those options going forward. And a lot of states will say, I'll pay you $10,000 if you move to my state. Connecticut, I'll train you. Make sure you get a good paying job. The other side of all of that is them being able to afford to live in Connecticut. I got, I mean, your state has reputation as being a fancy state. I think if I could say in sort of late person's terms, I was just reading about residents in Fairfield County fighting against affordable housing regulations that would increase affordable housing. How do you help with that on the state level? You're right. We haven't allowed much housing. And not much housing has been built in this state over the last 30 years. All of a sudden we're popular. A lot of people want to build housing. The right place to build it is in our downtown areas. We've had more housing starts in the last six months, you know, than anytime, you know, this century. But we have a long way to go. Every business I talk to, they ask me the same things. Workforce, what we're doing there. And will there be a place for people to live. Especially young people. So what are you saying on that ladder question? How do you guys help with fostering more of that construction, especially when the local communities don't necessarily want it? Some of the suburban communities have a little bit of NIMBY, but we've got more housing being built affordable housing, worker housing, single people housing in Stanford and Norwalk and New Haven than ever before. I was really impressed by a travel figure. I saw regarding your state that you guys provided that overnight road trips this summer to Connecticut were up 10.6% year after year. The number one state in the nation for overnight trips. And you guys have spent a lot on a big tourism campaign. Do you expect as things maybe retrench a little bit in the economy? You guys going to keep pushing the tourism spending to get people here. Yeah, it's a beautiful state and people like to visit your as your number show. It was sort of weird during the worst of COVID, 2021. We kept our beat to Zo. We kept our parks open. We had more visitors in the state of Connecticut during those two years and ever before in our history. And I think a lot of people fell in love with the state and state. What's your favorite place to visit in Connecticut? I'll tell you what I love. I love the fact that there's a park within about a 10 minute drive of any place in this state. So we have the best mix of indoor outdoor live workplace. Governor, thank you so much for talking with me today. Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut. Back to you guys. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,32,2022-10-12 16:07:52
3123," you you and A a vulnerable position currently above the $19,000 mark ahead of Thursday's inflation print as the Federal Reserve looks to continue its hawkish tightening cycle, joining us now to weigh in on the crypto spaces, Galaxy Digital Founder and CEO Mike Novogratz joined by Yowl Finance's crypto reporter David Hollerith. Mike, great to get some time with you. It's been a while here. Talk to us about prices here. How much, what would happen to Bitcoin if we did in fact get that Fed pivot? Liz, I think once the Fed pivots, you're going to see assets in general rally, right? You've had a tremendous sell-off across the board based on Chairman Powell being really hawkish in the Fed. And rightfully so, people always ask me, well, Bitcoin didn't work as an inflation hedge. And I'm like, are you guys crazy? It went from $10,000 to $70,000 when the Fed was producing inflation. Since the Fed has decided to try to smash inflation by raising rates aggressively, the most aggressive rate raising in our lifetime, Bitcoin sold off with other assets. It's actually done better than most. And I think if you finally get the pause, you'll start seeing Bitcoin pick back up, Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Listen, are we going to get the pause? At one point, yes, we priced in a lot, but the inflation data is still lagging and hot. And the employment data we just got was pretty darn strong. And so, this normally works. You'll have to see the ISM or the manufacturing data plunge first, go from 50 to 48 to 40. What will follow that will be earnings, inflation and employment, which is a lagging indicator. And so, you know, the bearer case is we've got two to six months left of this pain. The bull case is, you know, the market starts breaking. We're seeing a lot of breakage, not in necessarily crypto, but in the rest of the world. And crypto is interesting in that, you know, three months ago after the big sell-off and the deleverging, most people that needed to sell sold. And so, you've seen price, price is much more muted. You know, things take off when there's a good story and they sell right back off when the story goes away. And so, a lot less activity in crypto, a lot less for sellers, but also a lot less new buyers. Mike, typically during some of the crypto winters, as we see the most innovation, especially within the underlying technology in blockchain as well. But we know that there are even more bills within Congress that have moved forward as well over the course of this year. That regulation is set to still go full steam ahead in some of the discussions. And so, with regard to that, the bill's giving validation. But does that also, to your perspective, pump the value of crypto? And are there some cryptos that are not created equal perhaps? In that sense. That's a great question. Listen, I think two things are happening.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,33,2022-10-12 16:11:42
3124," pump the value of crypto, and are there some cryptos that are not created equal perhaps? In that sense. It's a great question. Listen, I think two things are happening, and you can't deny they're happening. One is institutions across the board are putting big resources into building for the next crypto spring. That's guys like Citadel in their exchange. It's people like BlackRock with Aladdin, it's hedge funds, it's Citibanks and Goldman Sachs getting ready for a tokenization revolution that's coming, I don't know, in two years and three years, four years, whenever. So there's almost a sense of inevitability that this is going to be a big industry. It's a shocking difference than last crypto winter. That said, buying the coins right now, there's just less enthusiasm until the macro changes. I do think Congress has done a good job of getting educated. I was just down in DC for three days and met with, I don't know, 14 different congressmen and senators and was pleasantly surprised at how up the speed they were. I got my fingers crossed that the Ag Bill gets put into committee and potentially voted on in a in the lame duck session. That would be a great first step in starting some crypto regulation. My fear is nothing happens until post election and then you're going to, then you're going to, you know, then we'll see what happens. Maybe that, depending on how the election goes, the cards change. We do need some regulation to get things moving. Mike, there's over 500 crypto exchanges and trading venues worldwide. I was just thinking in the context of what sounds like a prolonged bear market and then also these much larger traditional institutions coming in. What sort of your expectation for what happens to those 500 exchanges? You know, it's interesting. So some of the exchanges cost very little to run, right? These are basically code. And as you got closer to a regulated world, you look at what claim based costs and your building services and your building KYC and you know, they cost more and more. And so I think as you look at what I'll call regulated exchanges or exchanges that have some regulator, you probably see a consolidation and they probably still need to cut costs. And so, but you know, exchanges of funny word, most of these exchanges should be thought of as as broker dealers, right? QAIM base is closer to fidelity than it is to the New York stock exchange. I mean, it has a tens of millions of customers that it deals with that that uses app that keep things on its in its system, right? New York stock exchange does it. You go to and trade and you have a broker deal that you trades with it. And so calling them all exchanges as a misnomer, they have matching instances and they have exchanges, but their primary business is really that of collecting customers. And I think it's a consolidation there. Right. Turning to this from a sustainability report that Galaxy put out this morning. Sort of a benchmark for the industry in a sense of transparency. But I was just curious, in the report you revealed that 68% of the company's carbon footprint comes from its Bitcoin mining operations. And that long term, you're aiming for making the energy sources for those operations 80% coming from renewable energy. And so I was just curious, what is the timeline for where you when you when the company plans to hit that 80% mark? I think we're pretty close already. And so I would, you know, without actually talking to the mining team this morning, I don't want to give you a bad bad data point, but we're pretty close to 80% already. This is one of the unfortunate things that happened in the last two years of crypto is this narrative that Bitcoin uses too much electricity showed up. Reality, total Bitcoin mining uses.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,34,2022-10-12 16:16:06
3125," that happened in the last two years of crypto is this narrative that Bitcoin uses too much electricity showed up. Reality, total Bitcoin mining uses less electricity than hair dryers or Christmas lights. You know, it's not zero. It's certainly a significant amount, but it's a fraction of global power supply. And so, you know, when you think about the fewer the master of the galaxy, you would allocate electricity to things you think are valuable. Like YouTube uses a lot more electricity than Bitcoin mining. Listen, I think YouTube is an unbelievable innovation and it deserves some electricity budget. And so, it's Bitcoin because it can exactly specify how much electricity it uses and it produces those reports on a monthly basis. You know, the community says this is what what has gone into mining. It's an easy target, but it shouldn't be a target. And so, listen, we are moving towards a greener footprint because I think all companies should. But I don't want to, in essence, condone the fact that I feel like Bitcoin is being singled out as an industry, because a few people pointed at it and said, oh, this is an easy state though. Thanks for giving me a viable reason not to put up Christmas slice this year, Mike. I definitely appreciate that. And alternative, perhaps. Also, while we have you here though, considering a lot of companies, CEOs, executives, they're implementing their recession playbooks and kind of dusting that off right now, given that you've seen this before. You've seen this in the past, but for crypto this time and the amount of holdings that you do have, do you plan on kind of selling any of that, liquidating any of that in order to just show up the coffers of cash in order to make sure that your businesses can also navigate. You know, we luckily sold over a billion dollars of stuff last year at better prices and certainly don't want to get into the business of burning the furniture to run the business. And so, we're going to try to manage our business towards what we think our rational revenue targets. Listen, revenue is coming down in the industry. Volumes are down. Excitement is down. In this winter could last longer than people think. It might be shorter. It's hard to predict when these crypto winners, how long they go. You know, we're a couple years from a having cycle. I do think the Fed flinching creates some enthusiasm around Bitcoin as a store of value Bitcoin as a recession as an inflation hedge as a hard money when the rest of the world keeps printing money. But we're going to manage our business to what we think is a rational revenue stream for our five operating businesses is trying to try to keep the balance sheet separate. And Mike, if we sort of think of the 1980 period in the 1960s to 1980 for the stock market, this sort of a worst case scenario for what this bear market could look like across the equities market and crypto. I was sort of curious, you know, how do you think a crypto investor should operate in this environment? That period of time sort of likened as sort of excellent for stock pickers. What do you think? How are you evaluating crypto currencies? Yeah, listen, in some ways, this is the most challenging macro environment for any investor. And if you had all the foresight of the sages, you would have just been in US dollar cash all year long, right? When the whole world was saying cash is trash, cash is trash, was time to just go along, you know, one week T-bills and wait, or go short markets. We're in a mess globally, right? Japan has got a monster imbalance intervening in their currency market while supporting an interest rate market as inflation slowly creeps higher. That is a potential real problem. You saw what happened in the UK and they're trying to get this genie back in the box. But once confidence breaks down, it's really hard to get it back. And so what the Fed is doing is trying to preserve confidence in the US system. Now, what they need, and we'll see if you get it, is a congress that is willing to take some pain. Politicians are not normally...ko...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,35,2022-10-12 16:20:43
3126," Now, what they need, and we'll see if you get it, is a Congress that is willing to take some pain, politicians are not normally coded to take pain, right? So you already see in France, hey, we're going to do a hundred billion dollar subsidy because energy prices are too high and hence that's driving inflation. So we're going to give more money to the system. Like that's counterintuitive. I understand where it comes from, people are suffering, but as you use printed dollars or printed euros in this case, you know, it creates this inflation cycle. And so it's a really treacherous market, you know, could the S&P, what's it, 30, whatever, 3600 today, could it end the year at 3,300, 3,300, kind of looks like where the chart would go? What's hard about these environments is they don't get there a straight line, right? There is a tremendous amount of fear in the market right now. And so like on Monday, we already saw 6% rally in it got reversed. It doesn't feel to me that the stock market low is in, that we're going to have more pain before we see clear sailing. And you know, there is a chance that even when the Fed thinks it's finished, they pause at if the federal government doesn't tighten its belt and starts feeling this populism surge, you know, the cycle picks up again. And so I would say for now until the next, you know, until further notice, at least 12 months, these are going to be really complicated markets to trade and complicated markets to make money in. And in some ways, just preserving your wealth is a huge win, right? Not actually having monster gains, but not losing money could be a huge win. All right. I need to grab my parfer and Bill DeBare Teddy, you're my appreciated. Maybe I'll mark the low for you guys. Good stuff there. Alex, a digital founder, NCEO, Mike Novigratz, Mike, I have you back here sometime soon. Appreciate the conversation. As well as Yahoo Finance's own David Hollerith. Thank you both. Luxury brand Golden Goose is doubling down on control of its supply chain with the purchase of its top supplier. This as it looks to boost its $227 million in sales from the first half of the year. Golden Goose CEO Silvio Compower joins us now alongside Yahoo Finance's Brook Dupama. Silvio, good to see you here. Help us understand the, I would say infatuation with your brand. What drives that? First of all, thank you so much for being here for a former small company from Venice. He's a big achievement. He's always nice for me when I can represent all my people and trying to explain the magic behind our, I would say, special story. This is probably part of the magic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,36,2022-10-12 16:24:51
3127," the magic behind our, I would say, you know, special story. And this is probably part of the magic, not in the miracle that you were talking about. People perceive that and the magic is we need to be able to put in our product what then the people perceive as something special because for people it's sort of how special today is not about how much or how much this mancy is a product. And speaking of that allure among consumers right now you're in LA for a Golden Goose event. You're going to have contact creators there. We've seen the likes of Taylor Swift and Reese Witherspoon wear Golden Goose sneakers. How important has it been for influencers like those to wear your brand and ultimately drive to your success? It's a great question and I have a simple answer. What's magical is that we never place this product to be celebrities because Golden Goose is made it is made in order to make everyone feel special. So the fact that every shoe is made, every shoe is unique is making our customer become you know a lover and the fact that this celebrity has been wearing it has been just a great amplifier to a message that is simple and is not limited just for us more community while it's really open to a wider community. What are we seeing in the style trends right now? I mean for Kanye West and Gap it's been about some of the kind of more I won't say basic or kind of dirty looks out there but there is something that's out there to like making things look lived in already even before they sell. What is it with the trends right now that you're seeing how much do you expect to kind of be able to lean further into that and where the customer is actually continuing to take price despite hey looks like a shoe has a scuff on it. What's up with that? Thank you Brian for this question because this is technically the first time that I'm answering to this question line to someone and it has been you know quite a question for a couple of years because you should remember that Golden Goose has been the first brand ever to this dress for sneakers and at the beginning people were a little bit like skeptic go why like why do I have to spend 500 bucks you know for the early shoe while the it was part of the magic again Golden Goose never wanted to promote the product of now we always want to know the people to talk about our product so there was a space of an undefined space where the people were not really getting about that but the reality is that simply what we try to do is to inject in life to our product is to unleash the sense of uniqueness of every product we offer to our communities and it's a little bit like you know your old device it is always the most special because you really taking with it your memories no so every item that keep with you and keep with it you know his memories is then more special than something just because it's more extensive you know so there's a new notion of going from product to purpose product to values rather than just the product so this is what is going on right now in the industry and I think the example of Kanye is very interesting quite far from Golden Goose because Kanye is still you know quite fashion focused why Golden Goose is consumer obsessed so these position Golden Goose in a very special angle of being the same and speaking of just the long term goal of Golden Goose you've been in this industry since 2000 you've been through three different investment groups here latest premier took a majority stake in Golden Goose so I have to ask here there are also the owners of Doc Mardin's Valentino could we see Golden Goose go public in the near future I mean it's part of course you know of the options and the most important to us where we we may focus our two things first creating value every day to our consumers second to stay flexible because the market outside is very complicated and very complex and as you can imagine you know consumers is really one of the first angles that the market and these difficulties and opportunities came that we they reflected on so it is very important in this process of education to stay flexible now that's extremely important to bring up especially in this conversation and especially in this timing right now given your kind of consumer base that you go after the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the Golden Goose product",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,37,2022-10-12 16:29:15
3128," especially in this timing right now, given your kind of consumer base that you go after, the more affluent consumer that is kind of flocking to the golden goose product, if you will, even with some of the anticipated recessionary concerns that many consumers have, are you seeing that show up in any of the sales figures and any of the relationship with that consumer right now? It's a great question. So as you can imagine, for sure, you know that almost 42, 44% of our businesses are driven by Americas. And so, you know, I have a really special angle to be in Italian brand because now we need many Italian brands have the lucky that Golden Gooses. And I can tell you that on the American point of view, we didn't see any recession. Last year we achieved something around 78% plus versus the 2020. And this year we are in the zone of plus 40 versus next year, versus last year in America. And in general, the company, the first semester that's been performing like in creative, but you know, like last year, why? Because again, we don't really look at the trend in fashion. We really look in trend in consumer. And there's something that is for sure. The KPIs that consumers look at are not a bidder or no cost conversion is no revenues, but are really like MPS customer acquisition is really the ability that the company and the brand has to retain and compensate with these communities. So this is where Golden Gooses really representing an excellence. And I really think that we are really representing a kind of new frontier for the consumer industry on this side. Really fascinating. I've seen so many of your products on some of the high end kind of fashion retailers and resailers out there as well. And so I'm excited to see where the brand goes from here. Golden Goose CEO, Sylvia Kamparr joining us here today. Thanks so much for the time as well as Yahoo finances on Brook to Alma. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. I'm Julie Heimann live at the Greenwich Economic Forum in Greenwich, Connecticut. A big focus here of the speakers today and of the subjects of conversation is on alternative investments. Those outside sort of stocks and bonds. And my next guest knows a lot about this area. He's Matt Brown, founder and CEO of Case, which is a firm that basically provides a technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,38,2022-10-12 16:33:35
3129," sort of stocks and bonds and my next guest knows a lot about this area. He's Matt Brown, founder and CEO of Case, which is a firm that basically provides a technology platform for many of those alternative investments. So before we dig into it, can you just tell me a little bit more about what you guys do? Absolutely. First of all, thanks for having me. It's great to be here. Case, as you said, is a technology platform and what we do is we connect the very fragmented a universe of financial advisors across America with the leading alternative investment funds. So I think private equity, private credit, hedge fund strategies, real estate strategies. And the reason that's valuable is because those two communities really didn't have access to each other prior to a technology that allows it to be easy and simple to connect. Well, and I feel like retail investors writ large didn't really have access to these kinds of investment. The thinking always was, you have to be an accredited investor, which means, among other things, that you have to have a certain amount of money. Do you think all of that needs to change? Do you think we need to have sort of radical accessibility to these kinds of investments? Well, the world is changing. And there's really a moment in time now that we're seeing a lot of forces come to play. There's really four major trends that are coming together and you mentioned one of them. So we want to start there, which is the regulatory environment on who governs who can access alternative investments. I think previously, as you said, the bar was quite high. The SEC's view was, if you invest in alternatives, we want you to have a lot of capital just in case it doesn't work out. I think where they realized over the last 10 years is that all of them have really done their job. What they've done is to be able to take advantage of unique opportunities that the public markets don't offer while protecting the downside of investors in turbulent times like we're having now. And the SEC now is kind of saying, wait a second, maybe we've excluded too many people and not made it more broadly available. So they're changing and modifying their stance on that, which is creating a much more inclusive investing environment and very much along the themes of democratization of access. Yeah, and to your point, it's not as if you're insulated from downside if you're in the equity market. Well, I mean, that's the 60, 40 portfolio I can say it here, I think is officially over. I think markets like this have really just once again demonstrated that you can't just have a portfolio that is only equities and fixed income. The modern portfolio is really a three-dimensional portfolio. It's stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. And most people are talking that it's going to be 50, 50, 30, 20, 20 being, of course, alternative investments. What said do you think that there is a risk with more people getting involved in alternative investments? I see just the opposite. We look at some of the greatest asset managers in the alternative space, many of which are on our platform and available. You know, decade after decade, they've delivered. I would argue that if you're a financial advisor and you're not allocating your clients capital in alternative investments, you're at risk of losing your business. That's the impact positive impact all it's are having. I mean, at the same time, if we are headed into a downturn during the financial crisis, certainly all of us were not immune. If anything, some of them were the sources of some of the, you know, fractures that we saw within the system. Well, I think when you look at the track record of how portfolios perform in good times, and in times like we have right now with high volatility, they're added value, far exceeds, any kind of negative impact that one or two could have. You know, you look at the largest and most sophisticated investors in the world, institutional investors, average allocation rates to alternative investments, 30 to 50 percent of their portfolio overall. Interestingly, look at that same lens on wealth management in America, which controls $40 trillion, less than 5 percent, probably closer to 2 to 3 percent, but it's rising. Advisor demand is picking up. Economic managers see wealth as a huge market of new clients for them and new investors. Regulation, as we mentioned, is changing. And now with this technology, that's going to make it all easier. So all of this implies that even if we're seeing a pullback generally, potentially in things like software spending, that maybe you're not seeing that in your business, or are you? What are you seeing right now among your clients at a time where we're seeing that increased volatility? No, it's just, superior.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,39,2022-10-12 16:38:15
3130," ex-op or spending that maybe you're not seeing that in your business. Or are you? What are you seeing right now among your clients at a time where we're seeing that increased volatility? So it's interesting as a platform provider, we're neutral. So we don't really have a dog in the fight, we observe. We want to provide the service. Well, you're neutral, but your clients who make their money on it are not necessarily neutral. Right. So are they pulling, are they new trenching? Yes. So what we're seeing is three or four really defined areas. With the European uncertainty, with the Ukraine situation, with an energy crisis, with the political environment here in the US, all that rising interest rates, rising inflation, all that's factoring into the psyche of the advisor and the end client. So what we are observing on our platform is where the money's going. So we're actually standing back and saying, okay, where are the advisors allocating? So they're allocating to macro strategies right now. Edge fund strategies that are nimble and opportunistic. They're allocating to private credit and real assets. So it's quite interesting to see the ebbs and flows of capital flows into different strategies based on the current economic environment. Well, we'll have to catch up with you again in a few months and see where those flows are going. Matt Brown, Founder and CEO of Case. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. you you I'm梅 The new global outlook continuing to stall. On inflation, the fund sees price rises peaking late this year, but remaining at elevated levels. Joining us to discuss the report is Pierre Olivier Grinchas, the IMF's chief economist. We've also got Yahoo Finance's Gen Chamburger joining in on the conversation. Pierre, it's good to talk to you today. You know, I'm thinking about these so-called stormy waters you've described in the report, whether it's the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis, what's happening in China. These have all been headwinds that you've been watching throughout the year. To what extent have they accelerated in the second half of the year that leads you to this downgrade? Well, it's certainly the case that some of the risks that we had flagged in earlier projection rounds, particularly in July, but even if you go back to April, have started to materialize. I mean, the energy crisis that results from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is perhaps the clearest one where we see this incredible toll that's taking on European economies right now. And also the fight against inflation that is proving quite challenging. Inflation keeps going up still. I mean, we're expecting that it's going to peak soon and then start going down as a result in part of actions by central banks, but it's proven both more persistent, more elevated.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,40,2022-10-12 16:42:08
3131," that it's going to peak soon and then start going down as a result in part of actions by central banks, but it's proven both more persistent, more elevated, and also broader. It's not just energy prices that are going up. It's what we call core inflation that excludes energy and food prices. It is also pushing upwards. And so that's something that complicates the task for central banks around the world. The final factor in our forecast is of course the slowdown in China. There is a little bit less of a downward revision there. I mean, that's something that we saw a sharp slowdown in the second quarter of the year. And going forward, zero COVID policy is certainly leading to some localized lockdowns and confinement, or affecting activity and the weakness in the property sector is also another factor. Here, Jennifer Seanberger here, it's great to see you. It seems like the global economy is really being stretched here. Perhaps on a string, you mentioned that a third of the countries will contract and grow this year or next. We've got the war in Ukraine. We've got interest rates going up globally. You mentioned the slowdown in China. We just saw the services sector contract in September for the first time in four months. So it just seems that it's not going to take much to push it over the edge. What do you see as the odds of the global economy tipping into recession next year? Well, we certainly flag a number of downside risks in our report. Some of them you mentioned, I mean, the fight against inflation could prove more difficult than we expected this point. We could have more energy-priced shocks. Markets could certainly experience a lot of stress. And associated with that in parts of the world, the strength of the dollar is an important factor. So we try to put all of this in an assessment of the risks around our baseline. And what we found out is that there is about a 25% probability that growth in 2023, global growth, could be at about 2%. And 2% is a very low number. We only had that about five times since 1970. And every time we had this, if you look, it's 1973, the oil price shocked 1981 and the fall curve disinflation, the 2008 financial crisis, all of them are sort of they are stuck in our collective memory as times of difficulties. And there's a 10 to 15% chance that actually output growth could be even lower than 1%. Now 1% is an interesting marker because this is at the level at which global output would remain stagnant per capita. And so that would be an economy that is not growing at all globally. Up here, you mentioned the strength of the dollar, a big concern, something we've been watching. I mean, what we're seeing are major economy currencies here, whether that is the yen, the euro, the sterling, see huge swings on the back of the dollar strength, but it's the EMs that get hit even harder, given the dollar's nominated debt. How are you looking at that risk being elevated even further, given that it doesn't look like the dollar is going to pull back anytime soon? Yes, there's been a lot of strength in the dollar. Actually, what's interesting there also to point out is the strength of the dollar has been particularly important against other advanced economies. So the Japanese yen or the euro or the sterling. So more so than against many emerging market economies. In fact, even some emerging market economies, if you look at Brazil or Mexico or Peru, their currencies are appreciated against the US dollars. So it's more against advanced economies and emerging market economies. But in part, this is also because appreciation of the dollar is very painful in emerging market economies. So a number of them had already started tightening monetary policy, raising their policy rates, adjusting course if you want for their own economies and found themselves in a different position compared to, say, the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England. But this stress coming from the dollar are really important. They play out through multiple channels. They increase inflation in the rest of the world because a lot of goods are invoiced in dollars. And they also increase financial stress because countries or corporations that have debt in dollars find that it becomes harder to service them. Now, if you want to think about how countries should address that, our recommendation to this point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,41,2022-10-12 16:46:48
3132," corporations that have debt in dollars find that it becomes harder to service them. Now, if you want to think about how countries should address that, our recommendation at this point is that these movements in the dollar are really reflecting fundamental forces that are at play, the fight against inflation, the energy crisis. And so countries should try to sort of let the exchange rate adjust and accommodate because it reflects the sort of underlying change in the economy. Pierre, Olivia Garene-Jas, the IMF's chief economist, really appreciate your time today. And our thanks to Yahoo Finance is Jen Chamburger as well. We have a clean energy, a stark report from the IEA last year outlined the need for concerted efforts to deliver sustainable energy to the developing world. It said annual clean energy investment in these economies needs to increase by more than 7 times if net zero by 2050 is to become a reality. One group working towards this goal is the climate investment funds. One of the world's biggest multilateral funds for climate action and developing nations last week it received a fresh $950 million loan from the U.S. Treasury joining us now for a weekly charging forward segment brought to you by BMW is Daniel Morris, CIF, senior climate change specialist. Good to talk to you today. Let's start with that big injection. It is a loan not necessarily a capital injection, but how do you plan to deploy that capital? Yeah, thanks, Akiko. The loan that we received from the U.S. really helps support our new accelerating coal transition program. It's a program that's been developed over the past couple of years to help some of the key emerging economies that are very reliant on coal accelerate and move away from using that power source and toward more renewable power sources. So within the program there are kind of four major countries that are participating, India, Indonesia, South Africa and the Philippines. And this large loan will help execute projects that are under design now. Right now those countries are putting together investment plans that will lay out how they intend to deploy investments and bring co-finance years into support over the next few years. And that will be a big part of that. Daniel, we're just a few weeks out from COP27 over in Egypt. I'm thinking back to the big pledges that were made on climate financing a year ago. The argument would be that certainly a lot of these governments as well as companies haven't really put their backs up their actions with the pledges they've made. When you look globally where the need is right now, where do you see it? You know, when it comes to tackling a problem like climate change, there are so many needs that it's hard to isolate them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,42,2022-10-12 16:50:57
3133," Yeah. You know, when it comes to tackling a problem like climate change, there are so many needs that it's hard to isolate them. So I think you need to deploy a broad approach. You know, I work in the clean energy and clean tech sector. And we have a lot of resources that we can bear on different things, you know, investments in different types of technologies. That's established technologies like solar and wind and emerging technologies like say energy storage, e-mobility, green hydrogen. That needs a lot. And we're starting to see more and more of that. Of course, we need a lot more if we want to reach the goals that the international community has set out. But we also need to see a lot more investment in adaptation and resilience. A lot of countries, especially lower income countries, those that haven't really contributed much to the climate crisis of feeling the effects in really catastrophic ways. The most tangible example right now is Pakistan, where the flooding in August resulted in over 30 million being displaced. We need to build more climate resilient communities and the international finance community really needs to start to focus on those with a lot of large scale and a lot of power brought to bear to try and protect people from what will continue to be a change in climate. Daniel, really quickly, we've got the World Bank IMF meetings happening over in DC. This comes at a time when we had an op-ed coming out from former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers saying that the World Bank just is not doing enough in terms of financing some of these projects. When you think about the need globally, how much of this falls on the development banks? How much of it is on government? How much of it is on the private sector? How do you look at that breakdown? Yeah, I mean, it's a great question. I think I can talk a little bit about our experience in the climate investment funds. We are a fund that uses six multilateral development banks as our implementing entities. So we work with the World Bank. We work with the International Finance Corporation, the Regional Development Banks. And when you look at our overall portfolio, about a third of our co-finance in comes from the private sector. Another third comes from the MDVs themselves. And then we also have national governments in their bilateral institutions. It really is all hands on deck. I think that public financing really needs to pave the way to support communities that are in danger. OK. And kind of men and bring their power to their. Daniel Morris, climate investment funds, senior climate change specialists. Good to talk to you today. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,43,2022-10-12 16:55:17
3134," All right, well, Yahoo! Finances, Julie Hyman is live from the Greenwich Economic Forum. Now qué you will, you've had some ETFs that are anti ESG. So kind of how are you thinking about that environment right now? Well, there is a distinction, as you said, between what just capital does and the ESG movement. You know, I've been in that space a long time. And I think, you know, there is a lot of criticism around the ESG, the ESG investing that is valid. You know, any ESG is sort of not really addressed. A lot of issues like standardization, you know, quality of data and meaning and things like that. What just does is we pull the public on what issues matter. We track big publicly traded corporations on how they're doing on those things. And then we bring that to market in the form of investment products, indices, data, media, content, and so on and so forth. So for us, we're really in the business of tracking what are companies actually doing? And then when you pull the public and ask them what they think about this, you know, Americans are actually united, not divided. We see a huge amount of agreement across political lines as well, but by income, by geographic location, et cetera, on companies doing more. And the last thing I'll point out, which is really important, given where we are right now, is that it's good for business. You know, all the just indices have outperformed their benchmarks since inception and live trading. We've got the spread between the top 10% and bottom 10% over the, you know, since January 2018, it's a spread of over 40%. So we think it's good for business. But do companies think it's good for business? And especially do they think it's good for business? I mean, it's easy to say something's good for business and do something when everything's going well, right? It's when times are getting tougher that that's when it's a true test of a new way of looking at your corporate balance sheet, for example, and your spending, et cetera, all of that. So is that sort of holding up and do expect to continue to hold up if we go into a recession? I do. I'll tell you why. I think we saw during COVID, how many companies responded during a complete shock to the system, turned out companies that were leaders on investing in their workforce, for example, were much more resilient during that period of time. We haven't seen a pullback from the companies that we work with. So we engage probably over 500, maybe 600 companies. If anything this year, we've seen an intensification of their engagement with us, working with us on the underlying issues. That's kind of interesting. So no, I think companies that believe that this is good for business are in it for the long haul and probably see it as a way to actually more effectively manage your recession. The other thing I wanted to ask you about is, during this period of time when the workforce has been so tight, right, you have seen this surge in power of the worker. You've seen a surge in unionization. You've seen people sort of saying, I want to be hybrid and getting that. As the job market starts to change and shift and we start to see maybe layoffs pick up, do you think they'll retain that power? Well, I think it's constantly shifting, who wear that power really resides. But it doesn't take away from the fundamental issue of companies that invest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,44,2022-10-12 16:59:48
3135," Who wear that power really resides, but it doesn't take away from the fundamental issue of companies that invest in their workforce, provide great training, good benefits, they have better retention, better productivity. The business rationale is very strong, and company leaders, CEOs and boards that get that, believe that that's part of their competitive advantage. So, I don't think you become a good employer one day, and then a bad employer the next day, depending on how the labor market's moving. I think you, that's part of your business credo, or it's not. But I guess there are more companies sort of making that part of their business credo by necessity over the past couple of years, right? And I just wonder, is that necessity that impetus going to be taken away a little bit? I mean, we'll find out. I think we didn't really see it during COVID, like I said, and the economic shockwave that happened after that. I think companies today are beginning to see human capital as a real source of alpha. We see that in our own research. And so, if you're really trying to protect from the downside, batting down the hatches, you know, you might feel like you've got, you know, more of an ability to control wages, for example, or the amount of money you spend on benefits. But, you know, and maybe short-term, you have to pull some of those levers. But for the most part, I like to think that companies that we've seen so far are who believe that human capital is part of what makes them special will continue with that. Here's hoping. Here's hoping. Martin, it's good to see you in person, especially Martin Whitaker of Just Capital. Thank you. In this episode of Influencers, Dice Founder and CEO Phil Hutchin, along with Tony Fidel, Dice Board Member, Ness Founder, and inventor of the iPod. Humans need to be around other people. I mean, it's one of the things that make us, like, human and seeing it like an amazing performer. It's one of the things that you remember for the rest of your life. There's always unintended consequences in everything, and I, you know, technology's neutral. It's what we choose to do with and how we regulate and what we socially accept. I think we got a lot of fish to fry, and we are frying ourselves. So I think we need to spend more time on fixing the climate, and we need to worry about getting into the metaverse. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. And welcome to our guest Phil Hutchin, the founder and CEO of Dice. Also, Tony Fidel, a board member of Dice, Tony, as you may know, former Apple executive iPod and inventor iPhone Co-Inventer, also Ness Founder, and a principal at future shape, which is an investment and advisory firm work within engineers and scientists, developing deep, well, foundational deep technology, I should say, got all that. Okay, we want to talk about Dice and Phil. Why don't you start us off by telling us what Dice is all about and what you guys are doing. Yeah, no problem. And I see you, Andy. Well, first of all, Andy, have you ever bought a ticket? Yes, I have. And how was that? Not so good, Phil. And so I think that every time I kind of asked someone over the board of ticket, they'd never come back to me and with like this, like, oh my God, it was amazing. It was always like, I bought a ticket. I thought it was one price, and it was another price, or I couldn't buy a ticket and was thousands of dollars, or whatever it was, or you know, I'd missed it. I'd miss it out on the show, whatever it is. And so there's lots of problems around it, you know, the opaque nature of the industry. So Dice is a super simple way to find out what shows are going on. Two taps and you bought the ticket. You know, it's killed, scalping. And if you can't turn up to the show, you tap a button and you go, refund it. It's just making all these things traditionally associated with, you know, going to a live experience. They've gone on, and now it's, it's just very easy. I have a million more follow-up questions that we'll get to them. But Tony, I got to ask you, you joined the board of Dice in September. What made you a believer? And why join it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,45,2022-10-12 17:04:08
3136," Million more follow-up questions will get to them. But Tony, I got to ask you, you joined the board of Dyson September. What made you a believer? And why join at a time when the live music industry is still getting back on its feet with COVID? Very sure, Andy, as well. It's great to see you. So for me, you know, music's in my blood, you know, given my past and I'm from Detroit, right? So when I was in Detroit, exactly, you know, ticket master first came out and it was like a revolution. I could go walk down the local store and get a printed ticket. You'd have to go to the box office. And so that was an incredible innovation for me. But since that part, they haven't innovated a lot. It's still like, okay, what can we do to extract more money from the fans? Really is what it is. And it hasn't been about more convenience, about more access, making it easy. You know, you can say what you want about airline ticketing or other travel ticketing. At least you can exchange tickets, upgrade, then change the dates. I'm going to say, you don't have any of those conveniences at all in the ticketing, in the entertainment ticketing world or sports ticketing world. Well, that's what DICE is trying to solve. And because I'm such a music fanatic and have been suffering with these six for years, I met Phil and I didn't just get involved with DICE this year. I've been involved with Phil and DICE. I don't know, five, six years now. So this was like literally when they were like 10, 12, 15 people. So we've been working together with them and just been because of the experience that they really want to bring. Fans first, it's all about the fans. Even the artists, the venues, everyone understands that. More fans and especially today when bands are not making any money except for merchandise and for entertainment events. Other than that, they're not making any money on streaming. We see that unless you're the top 100 artists, they don't make any money. So where are they going to make their money? And how are they going to make sure the fan has a great experience? That's what DICE is all about. Phil, I got to ask you about the competitive set. I mean, Tony mentioned ticket master. They're still around, stub hub, event bright. What sets you guys to part from those companies? And how are you going to build your brand? Right. So I think I kind of touched on it. Like our any customers, the fans. And that was something that we established on day ones. Everything that we built is for that fine experience. When we're building things with partners, or venues, or artists, or anything else, we always ask the question, is it good for the fan? And I think that the second thing is that DICE is just software. So if you're looking at the live nation, they do huge productions, they do all these things. You're a ticket master as part of it. We're just using software to bring fans and artists closer together, like helping them decide which cities they are, and how much they should be charging. All these things to make it super efficient. And I think that the third is that we're able to scale much quicker around the globe. So maybe we started off in London, but now we're in the US, in France, Spain, Italy, and India, Australia, moving into Southeast Asia. So it's like, it's kind of there's a global network. In fact, that happens as well, because you're giving that data to artists to help them plan global strategies themselves. So it's just really, when we're talking about empowering artists, it's like helping them control the cash that they own, the cash they can pay people and do things, instead of waiting for someone to pay them. How do you mitigate against scalpers? You mentioned that. Can you drill down a little bit more there? Yeah, cool. So this is, I mean, it's like things where in hindsight, it's like so simple, but there's nothing to sell. Can you buy a ticket on DICE? There's no ticket. And so there's nothing. There's nothing to screenshot. There's nothing to pass on to somebody else or anything else. Just moments before the show, there's like an animated QR code that goes around, which is there. But it's a very elegant, simple solution, but it's a way that if you've got nothing to sell, then it's impossible for scalpers to put on any platform, because they don't have anything. And how much of the business bills rely on upon the return of live music to pre-pandemic levels? And what is your prediction about when that'll happen? So we've spent 18 months or, you know, we're going to take. And like sort of stuck in our homes, we've been in Tali Digital and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,46,2022-10-12 17:08:34
3137," So your prediction about when that'll happen? So we've spent 18 months or give a take. And like sort of stuck in our homes been entirely digital. And you're thinking about the one of the things that I didn't appreciate at the beginning of Dyson kind of really kicked in sort of just before the pandemic. Because that we saw some data on terms of loneliness for people aged between 17 and 21. And a third of them expressed that they had intense periods of loneliness, even before the pandemic. You put the pandemic on everyone kind of living digitally. The return to live since summer, it's been insane. I mean, every record has been broken at Dyson in the last five months. When we're looking at the data, still now, shows are completely packed, like the venues are packed, everything else. You're in the newspapers that people have become hesitant about stuff, and then you go to live concerts and they're absolutely full. And I think it's kind of going back into what I was talking about with learners, that humans need to be around other people. I mean, it's one of the things that make us like human and seeing like an amazing performer. And it's one of the things that you remember for the rest of your life. So you know, live experiences, I think that people are actually appreciating them even more as a result of the pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,47,2022-10-12 17:13:34
3138," I feel like I've been giving Tony a brief about musical preferences. I'm going to pitch you a little bit. Like I don't know if it's a DL or Coldplay. You know, I'm doing the UK thing with you. So do you work with the artists or do you work with the venues? So in other words, here in New York City, MSG, Madison Square Garden, are you selling tickets for them or are you selling tickets for Adele? So we do for both, but the focus is largely on venues because many artists play venues. But we have an artist development team and that's part of the idea of the global network because that DICE has venues all around the world and then artists want to play those venues. And we help them kind of connect them with those venues by the agents of the book or whatever else. And then part of that is, so I've got an example. So as an artist in London, pulled by the Internet. They started off with us from the very first show, 200 people and made the deal with them like called, sell exclusively through DICE, let's kind of build up this live story. And then from that, you know, you're not allowed to spend any money on social media advertising, you've got to trust it to your audience, but get the story right. Now they can sell 50,000 tickets in London and it's kind of like taking them at each of those steps all the way through. And throughout the whole time, Bicep understood their audience, they knew what they wanted where they wanted to play, they had control over, you know, their live strategy. And this is what we're doing at scale now. Right. And so do you cover all the venues in the world or do you have to, are there some venues that are not a part of your ecosystem yet? Yeah. So we wish we had, we have all the best ones, most of the best ones. So there's some holdouts. There's other people who have the ticketing rights for those venues. But we have, there's 3,600 venues sort of around the world, which is increasing day by day. And we also work largely in major cities. So the, you know, in New York, over a million people used DICE last month. And so it's quite a big spread of venues in New York. And for that, it's the same in Paris and Barcelona, all these things, because there's lots of events happening there. So the discovery engine is really kicking off. And our thing is that if you want to see a show once a month, and let's get you to show once a week, how to reduce the friction for you to actually get there. So, you know, our competition is like people stay in the home, which and Netflix is like, well, how do we make it as easy and compelling to kind of get out and see something in books? I don't think anyone's been to a great show and said, well, not doing that again. So it's the exact opposite. Tony, while I have a year, I got to ask you a few questions about Apple and the iPhone, Silicon Valley. So you were on the cutting edge and designing the iPhone, but it's been around for a while. What do you think is kind of the next big thing in terms of consumer tech? Thoughts on the metaverse? Those are two big questions happening right now. Well, the big things on the horizon for consumer electronics, you know, we're hearing more about, you know, augmented reality of these kinds of things. We're hearing about the metaverse, you know, frankly, I think we got a lot of fish to fry, and we are frying ourselves. So I think we need to spend more time on fixing the climate than we need to worry about getting into the metaverse. So let's make sure we have an environment to live in before we find another environment that, you know, keeps us in like refrigerated chambers and, you know, so that we can breathe and eat. So that's how I feel about the metaverse, you know, but on consumer electronics, I think, you know, a lot of this stuff, people think that this is going to be the next big thing, like augmented reality. I think it will be for certain very niche verticals, but not necessarily like the consumer thing that you need because, you know, we saw this before, you got to need the technology, and then you have to understand that the consumers want it, right? And they want to live in that. It live with these things on it. And it's social acceptance. It's not just you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,48,2022-10-12 17:17:06
3139," And they want to live in that. It live with these things on it. And it's social acceptance. Not just you accepting it, but the people around you accepting it. And that I've learned all the time is the technology might be right. But it's the social timing right. Is there a social acceptance? And are you truly delivering a pain killer because there's a clear need? There's a clear pain. The iPhone solved the need, right? It was on the go internet email media, these kinds of things. We don't see the need yet for the metaverse. And then to have the metaverse wherever you go on you, we already tried that with Google Glass. I think it's going to take a little while. Yeah. And speaking of Google, you invented, helped create the iPhone, the iPod Nest, which was bought by Google. And these products are networked now in a huge way. What does your take on both the upside and the downside of this massive amount of networking that some people say leads to dystopian possibilities, but also tremendous upside? Well, look, there's always unintended consequences in everything. And I, you know, technology's neutral. It's what we choose to do with it and how we regulate and what we socially accept. So we have to do things that are promote social bonding, like what Bill's doing with dice, right? Not letting the ticket bots in there, not letting the scalpers in there, doing all the things necessary. And that's what I love what Bill and Dice is doing is they're trying to bring all the best things to connect the artists to the fans, right? And getting rid of all of those middlemen who are just stealing along the way. So that's what we want to do. And I so I love the network. It can have better shows, have the artists make more things for their fans so that the fans have a better and better experience. And maybe through that, we can create even more social movements to fix some more of these problems. But it's about bringing people together and not about a network of intermediaries stealing along the way. Or just one more way back machine question. OK. Really OK. And that's you work with Steve Jobs. Apple built a music business when you were there. What did you learn from Steve? And what do you think he'd be thinking about the world today and the technology that we're using? Well, I think for me, what it was all about in the music story and the iPod, it was always about what do the customers really want? What is going to give them that social or next to me, that emotional experience that they crave, that they want, and a rational part of that, making it simple and all those other things? And that's kind of, that's like dice. So when you see something like this, you're like, wow. I think that if Steve was here today, he would go, we need to get artists more money. I think if he looked at the streaming services out there, I know how much he loved musicians, bands, and wanted to support them. I remember way back when he was looking and buying certain media companies, that kind of stuff, because he really wanted to revolutionize that. And so as far as I'm concerned, if he woke up today and saw the streaming services the way they are today and where the artists are not getting fairly paid, he would fix that. Absolutely. I remember too many infill when he came by and demoed the iPad at timing when I worked there and he played music and he played friend of the devil. And I said, oh, the grateful dead and he goes, I love the grateful dead. You can see he really meant it, right? Yeah, oh yeah. Really passionate about that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,49,2022-10-12 17:21:30
3140," you you you you You come from a musical background and music industry background i should say but jeez What made you decide to get in a ticketing? Yeah i mean, i wasn't tech before going into the music and I've not knowing anything about the music industry so very naive but it's very lucky in the music industry were getting bigger and bigger. And actually didn't care about ticketing. Didn't understand it because you spend so much time working with the artist and making an amazing album to make an amazing artwork, looking at their life. So, and didn't think about the ticketing until the artist got bigger in North America. And that was when it suddenly was like, hang on a minute, we did a deal for 40 bucks. And now the tick at 65, where's this 25 going? It sold out and it's been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars and all the fans are angry at the artist. Like, why is anyone fixing this? And so then I went back into sort of all world new world together and just analyzed all the ticket companies and tried them all out. Didn't want to just try and deceive. There was a solution and that was the thing well, if no one else is going to fix it, I guess that we have to do it. So I'm kind of just touching on to the last question as well. I think that's, you know, take a lot of inspiration from what Tony created. You know, really thinking about the small things, you know, the experience when someone sees it, small little animations within the app, the ticket, the imagery, you're talking about brand before like people wear dice t-shirts and have the bags and everything else like all these things, like things which we really care about, because you know, you need to make a revolution and all this stuff like pays off because eventually, because of all these things being put together, artists make more money in the right way. I didn't really ask you about the business model or your P&L, how are you doing? How's the company doing? So can you dive into that a little bit quickly? Sure, as I mentioned before, it was the, you know, we, you know, the pandemic and coming out of it was like, it was a shock. I mean, we went from no one going out to everyone going out. And, you know, from zero people in New York, like sort of going out to, you know, a million people going out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,50,2022-10-12 17:25:27
3141," went from no one going out to everyone going out. And from zero people in New York, like sort of going out to a million people going out. So we have a, you know, it's over a million in New York in the last month, a million in London, half a million Paris, like all these people sort of coming together. How we make money is that we charge the venues or the artists for using dice as their partner to sell the tickets. So it's like, we're very pro privacy. And so the, you know, again, just protecting the fans from this, but also everyone knows like how we make money, make money from selling the ticket. There's no advertising, nothing else. That's that's that's on there. And in terms of the, you know, the volume is like, it's, it's accelerating. It's turning out like every week. Right? Let me be clear. We're right. We're happily writing checks and we're backing these guys. And even in the darkest of times, we see, we see the light and we see the growth and we see the fans and they're coming back, right? It's sticky. People love it. They're telling their friends about it. We do very little advertising. I meet a ton of people go, I go, yeah, I'm in the investor in dice. It's like, oh, I'm a user. Like there's so many people. If you actually ask people in the regions where we operate, there's a lot of people using it. We just don't sit there and market it. And, you know, it's self-market because the fans love it. And so that's why we keep investing because we know this is the future and it already is here today. Word of mouth seems to be working. So are you guys venture back, build IPO in the future, perhaps? Yeah. So yeah, we venture back and and public listing in the future. Yeah. Great. And Tony, how did you guys meet? So interestingly enough, I had friends in London and they said, oh, you have to meet Phil. You guys would get along, you love music. He's doing something really cool. And Phil and I just were at a hotel, I think it was a ham yard. And we just had a drink and we just started talking. And we talked all about music. And then we started talking about books and started sharing titles and just getting into, you know, psychology of like a fan and what does it mean? And why do we love shows? And really just hit it off. And it was just there was like, okay, that's it. And Dice was tiny. It was just a vision. And so it was really about a team and a mission. And you know, and Phil as an entrepreneur and visionary. And Phil, where do you see the company five years, 10 years from now? I mean, doesn't it have to become part of one of the, well, they used to call it fangs. I guess they're mangs now. You know, part of an ecosystem. Everything's got to be part of an ecosystem. Or can it be a standalone? Do you think going to be a standalone? I think that live entertainment, you know, how people look at the, the, the, the, the market right now. I think it's, I think it's undercooked. I think that it's huge. I think that you've, you know, if you've got 90% of the population of the world liking music, maybe half the population loving music and 30% people love music so much that they pay to go see it. And that's a massive market. And I think that, you know, what we're seeing is growing this around the world. I mean, like for example, just starting off in India, that market could be as big as the US within 10 years. Right. I love the Pam thing. You know, that is a truly small set. People who hate music. I hate music. Right. I'm sorry about that. That's a pretty small group of people. Right? It's pretty cool. It was the same time for the iPod. It was the same time for the iPod. Right. Yeah, that's not right. That's about right. And final couple of last questions here. Phil, what do you think that you want to be your legacy? Wow. Absolutely. I was thinking about that one. OK. You know what? It's the idea. One of the things I love the most, yeah, is the idea that we're in Mumbai and there's a scene happening in Mumbai. And there's this new music that's happening in Mumbai. And through the connections of DICE, that artist goes straight into the US and Asia and through Europe and blows up. And we do that time, time again. That the idea of bringing culture sort of around the world, that would be awesome.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,51,2022-10-12 17:30:21
3142," Europe and blows up and we do that time time again. The idea of bringing culture around the world, that would be awesome. Tony, same question over to you. You've got all of these things you've accomplished, working here with DICE and I'm sure you got some all kinds of other things percolating your brain. What do you hope to accomplish over the following years? For me, it's really about mentoring and investing my time with the entrepreneurs who are truly changing the world for the better, whether that's environmentally, socially, or for health. Those are the three big things and DICE is doing that for the social experience all around the world. It's amazing and that's what I hope. Phil is able to fulfill and bring this mission and I think he's well along the way to deliver it. Well, it'd be great to watch the company grow as we hope we emerge from COVID and live comes back and people get interested in your business. So I want to thank Phil Hutchins founder and CEO of DICE and Tony Phil Board Member there and entrepreneur and executive extraordinaire. Thank you guys very much for your time. Thank you so much, Andy. Thanks, Andy. Great to see you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirwork. We'll see you next time. Welcome back. I'm Brian Sousie here with Julie Hyman and Brad Smith. We're seeing green on the screen today across the major indices. That's even as President Biden warned about a potential mild recession. Here's what we're watching for you at this moment. A caffeinated quarter, PepsiCo's checker page is read hot on Yow Finance this morning as the company blew away profit estimates, excuse me, and raised guidance. PepsiCo's CFL Hugh Johnson told us moments ago demand continues to be very strong and they are pushing through more price increases. More big calls. Earning the season officially ticked off today with PepsiCo's results. So, I'll have a look at a few pre-earnings calls by analysts on Apple and Norwegian cruise line. In the state of freelance workers, we'll talk to the CO5er on the outlook for the gig economy as economic growth slows. Brad, over to you at the Wi-Fi interactive. Can we get out? I was at the Yow Finance interactive. Was the Wi-Fi, whatever it is, there you are, Brad. There we are. All right. Taking a look at the dash-shones industrial average. Right now, we are holding onto some slight gains on the day by about half a percent right now for the average up by about 143 points. You've also got the NASDAQ composite tech heavy average in the green. It's up 3.10 per percent, 31 minutes into today's trading session, and the S&P 500. You're also seeing some green on the screen there. That's up a little more than 3.10 per percent. Taking a look at as well. Some of the activity that we're seeing more broadly here. Let me navigate us over to some of the NASDAQ 100 names that we've been continuing to track throughout the day. It looks like broadly you've got more advances than declines here. An interesting move here that we're seeing, especially in some of the retail names, you've got a sharp move higher in Louis Lemon on the day. We've been tracking that stock throughout the week, given some of the new bullish sentiment that's entered into the market, talking about Louis Lemon as well as the annexation to the Gen Z brand affinity with it. So we'll continue to watch Louis as we move forward throughout the rest of today's session. That's up by about 2 percent. Another big gainer here as well that we've got on the day. Ticker symbol, MRN, they will dive into that one in just a little bit. So stick around for that. Let's shift our broader market conversation after some data from the producer price index and with inflation showing. No relief. Our next guest says that a recession may be coming for more. Let's welcome in. The Chief Economist at EY Parthenon. Greg Dacco. Greg, great to have you here with us this morning. First and foremost, if we were to see that recession that perhaps many of the economists, if they are right, that it might be slight versus the more longer or protracted one, where do you fall within that camp? Well, I think we're certainly seeing the initial signs of a significant slowdown in terms of global activity. We are seeing an environment in which.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,52,2022-10-12 17:34:37
3143," Well, I think we're certainly seeing the initial signs of a significant slowdown in terms of global activity. We are seeing an environment in which European growth is slowing quite dramatically, in which growth across emerging markets is also slowing, and in which the U.S. economy is also starting to see initial signs of a slowdown. We're not hearing from the executives we speak to desire to retrench in terms of capex, in terms of hiring plans here in the U.S., but I am increasingly concerned that the global waves of uncertainty and the financial market stress that we're seeing globally will eventually affect the U.S. and lead us into a more profound recession. More profound recession, Greg. What does that look like in terms of GDP? Well, we are in an environment where our baseline forecast is for a mild contraction in GDP growth next year that would come on the back of growth around 1.5% this year. So that would be a mild recession. I think that if we look at household finances and corporate finances today, they are still rather healthy, so that would pretend to a more mild type of recession. But if the global waves of uncertainty, if the massive slowdown that we're expecting in Europe in emerging markets is exacerbating this slowdown in the U.S., then you could be in for a global recession in which we could see a more pronounced contraction in GDP, maybe on the order of 1% in the U.S. Greg, it's hard to know what to think right now, right? Because we are hearing a lot of prominent voices in markets and economics who are getting more pessimistic, right? This mild recession was sort of the base case for a while now, and now I feel like it's tilting more negative than that, and that there are risks coming on the periphery that then could cause more contagion. How are you weighing all of this right now? How do you figure out how concerned to be? Well, you're certainly right to highlight that we are navigating a world of uncertainty, and it's extremely difficult for business leaders to navigate this world of uncertainty where inflation remains a key constraint where the labor market is extremely tight, where the cost of capital is surging, and where there's massive uncertainty as to the geopolitical landscape. So it's a highly uncertain macroeconomic environment where it's very important to look not just at one base case, but really at scenarios around that base case. And I think you're right, risks are tilted to the downside. The baseline scenario is currently a mild recession. The upside is a soft landing of the global economy and of the U.S. economy by the Fed. The downside scenario could have some severe ramifications. If you have an excessive and disorderly tightening of financial conditions, that can have knock-on effects on to certain streams of the financial sector as we're seeing in the UK with pension funds. So there are a lot of unknowns out there, and I think that makes it very difficult to forecast with accuracy. So there is some discomfort in the fact that the baseline view is a recession, but we have to be acknowledged. We have to acknowledge the downside risks to global economic activity. Greg, at what point do you believe some of the Fed's activity will finally start to fully show up in the data and yield some of the results or at least the parameters that they're looking for in order to either pause or pivot? Well, I think they're going to be very attentive to what happens on the global financial conditions front. What was at the Naval Annual Conference over the first part of this week and Vice Chair Brainer highlighted, again, this concern about what's happening globally in terms of global financial conditions in terms of overall economic activity globally. And she highlighted the fact that we are in an environment where most central banks are tightening aggressively. And the fact that each of these central banks is tightening that aggressively has a greater effect than the sum of the individual tightening processes would normally have. And that is something that the Fed is going to be paying very close attention to as we move into 2023 because, again, the Fed leading the way has implications in terms of the dollar strengthening quite rapidly, exporting inflation into emerging markets, increasing the burden of debt for a lot of these emerging markets. And that's a concerning backdrop when it comes to the global economic environment. We know the U.S. is not immune to these global waves of uncertainty. No, it is not. Queues, no. Fuck off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,53,2022-10-12 17:38:56
3144," and backdrop when it comes to the global economic environment. We know the U.S. is not immune to these global waves of uncertainty. No, it is not. Greg Daco, EY, Parthenon, Chief Economist, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. All right, before we head to break, we are keeping a close eye on shares of McDonald's on some negative comments from City Analyst John Tower. Head of the company's October 27th earnings report. Tower site's foreign exchange headwinds, energy cost inflation, weakening store traffic data as key risk to McDonald's earnings days as tower. Investors have been anchored to the defensiveness of the U.S. business to spike these risks. And we believe peak valuation means a little room for shares to absorb a negative estimate of visions much less potential slowdown in the U.S. business. Coming out Amazon workers in California looking to unionize, Julie's got the details on that. Plus, more top headlines next. Let's get down to business now. Look at some of the other headlines that we are watching. Amazon potentially facing yet another front in ongoing unionization battles as workers at a California warehouse of petition the National Labor Relations Board to form a union. That moved the first step towards a formal vote and could see the warehouses 800 workers join the Amazon Labor Union. Petition comes as part of a way of unionization efforts hitting companies around the nation, including Starbucks, Chipotle, Apple. They're not used to unionization moves in their workhorse. This would be the first Amazon move by workers in California specifically.

3145," in California specifically. Canadian companies, Camaco and Brookfield Renewable partners, both moving this morning after agreeing to buy Westinghouse Electric, which still services half of the world's nuclear power reactors. Now the deal will see Brookfield Business Partners sell Westinghouse to the two companies, both the buyer, Brookfield Renewable and seller, Brookfield Business are part of the umbrella under Brookfield Asset Management and the deal comes as the world takes a renewed look at nuclear power following Russia's energy shut off to Europe and climate change problems grow. And the smash hit at NASA, the agency reporting it has successfully altered the path of the asteroid, dimorphous. After ramming its dark probe into it, scientists have confirmed dimorphous. Now orbits its parent asteroid in a tighter orbit that's now 32 minutes faster than before. The dark probe launched last year, sent back this video just two weeks ago before impact and it marks the first time humanity has ever altered the course of any celestial body. It also gives us one potential option for averting a planet ending catastrophe. Good to have that option. Indeed it is. All right, it's time for our calls of the day guys. I'm out of the shoot here with what is a I would call a blunt take on Apple head of their earnings on October 27th. Really interesting note by city analyst Jim Suvor, you see Apple shares up there slightly here in the early going. The headline of this report absolutely got me right at my alley. I love these, some of these, these crazier headlines and this one got me. He said, we are not scared of Apple stock despite Halloween and investor fears. So you know that Apple stock very Google SEO friendly nonetheless. He's listening or he's saying that iPhone demand continues to be very strong. They're selling more higher price products. That is good. Sticky services sales. That is good. Also suggesting more of an Apple car push in 2025. So this is more of a longer term bullish take by Suvor at city. I think acknowledges some concerns here going into the quarter. Some FX challenges. Maybe some slow down China but by and large. Just trying to I think bring a sense of hey guys this is Apple. They're going to get past any rough patch brought on by the global economy. Yeah, I think one thing that we do have to note within this as well is that for the iPhone the demand is typically going to always be there. It's just a matter of where they are in the cycle. Especially because so many people are able to pay off their phones through another type of necessity which is your telecommunications which is your phone carrier. And so that is perhaps one of the constants. It's just a matter of how much people are willing to take on a larger contract or go after a more expensive phone. If their telephone provider or their service provider is able to offer them a better deal. Now it's a larger question of course to right now of where in even the little luxuries we were talking about with Pepsi. Where that also kind of dovetails on over into the technology landscape as well in the consumer tech front. Do consumers look at some of the little luxuries and the wearables and say hey that's a little luxury or is my service a little luxury that I can maintain. And for Apple they've been continuing to build out that services business can be potentially an 80 billion dollar run rate business either by the end of this year or early next year. And so that's something they continue to watch going forward in the services and the wearables division for Apple. Yeah even if it might see some rockiness in the short term from some of those production cuts that we've talked about. Absolutely. Also another call of the one that I'm tracking here. Norwegian Cruise Line ticker symbol NClH. It's smoother sailing for new region after an upgrade to buy at UBS. The analyst also setting a $15 price target on the stock here and particularly they are kind of adjusting all cruise line models. It's not just Norwegian. It's Royal Caribbean Caribbean Caribbean anyway. Carnival Cruise Line that's pronounced the same way. They're adjusting it for all cruise line models for slightly higher expenses due to inflation and essentially here when you think about the broader cruise sector of course there's a lot of money that we've talked about goes out the door when it's a marketing type of expense that they have to look at just to reengage with so many of the consumers out there or the voyage takers. But then it's also on the other side how much they're actually being able to charge for tickets in this near-term period of time. And that's something that all of the analysts have continued to have to look through the profit margin models at and try to figure out exactly where that's actually going to be netting out for the cruise line operator. Yeah interesting time to see this call because we see fuel prices back on the rise. You have been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, we ticket pricing, notably coming out of Cardinal Cruise Line. But we just talked to Norwegians.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,55,2022-10-12 17:47:32
3146," Fuel prices back on the rise. You've been highlighting it too. We've been talking a lot about weak pricing, weak ticket pricing, notably coming out of Cardinal Cruise Line. But look, we just talked to Norwegians CFO Mark Kempe last week and he said, man, is strong? We're charging higher prices. If you look at Q3 and our most recent guidance, we had said that our total net revenue per diems are expected to be up in the high single digits. So again, there's inflation is real. It is starting to level off. We are going to see some near term pressure on margins. But we don't believe that this is going to be a long term sustainable margin issue. As we look at and look at our trends and our business over the next year to two years, we see margin improvement significantly. And we believe we can get back to the same margin levels we saw prior to the pandemic. There you go. Really a bullish take-off. I kind of came aboard on a new ship. So despite the economic slowdown, you still have Norwegian and of course, all the cruise lines, they order these ships well in advance, but still delivering it a mighty new beautiful ship called, I think it was the Prima. Right. And I'll just add just very briefly here, as well within this call, they said, they see this as the most preferred name and it's due to relatively greater concentration of domestic passengers, sourced strong pricing given its higher exposure to the luxury segment. And the luxury consumer, whether it's across retail, consumer tech, and then even within the cruise line operators right now, continually being cited as one of the points of strain. All right, let's talk coffee, okay? Dutch Bros, bit of a perk up. I'm watching shares of Dutch Brothers this morning. Dutch Bro, I think it's a technically Dutch Bro. I think it's a Brooklyn palm tree right there. Dutch Bros. Dutch Bro's right. It is up a little bit after JP Morgan Chase upgraded the stock to overweight with a $38 price target. What's interesting here is the stock was up earlier as much as 5%, so it's actually, we've seen that those gains come back a little bit, but the analyst there at JP Morgan saying the sell-up has made it attractive, sites that change permanence over time through differentiated drinks. Some interesting stuff here. 56% of customers under 25 drink, 80% cold beverages, and 60% of sales afternoon. And that's sort of more discretionary, so maybe that's a little bit more vulnerable. Oh, I guess not. Yeah, everybody's complaining about Insomnia. Yeah, think if you're drinking a giant cold brew afternoon, could be also, you're looking at your phone for the two hours before bed. That doesn't help either. But I digress. The point is here is that the analyst at JP Morgan likes Dutch Bros and says that employment and stable gas prices are key to more predictable sales here, but that the company is in decent position here and it has the capital it needs to grow the business. I think I'm gonna, I need to take off a couple days from the office, just visit a Dutch Bros. Maybe to be my vacation. I see all the photos posted on Instagram, on Twitter. People are obsessed with Dutch Bros coffee. It looks beautiful and I think it has more caffeine in some cases depending on what you order than Starbucks. That's where I'm going vacation. I'm gonna go visit a Dutch Bros. Oh, wait, okay, everybody, can we clip this please? Ryan, it's how you just promise, he is going to take out vacation. I suggest it. Thank you, man. That's a promise. I suggest it. I'm gonna go visit Dutch Bros and I wanna report from outside of Dutch Bros with my phone. You're not allowed to log on. It's live view. I'm not gonna do it. While you're on vacation. Fair enough, fair enough, Dutch Bros. How depressing. Unilaterally. So depressing. All right, coming up, possible shakeup for good workers. We're gonna speak with the CEO of Fiverr about that and also a new study that the company's out with next.

3147," Here we go! The majority of bosses won employees back in the office full time. The new survey from Fiverr found that 52% of employers want their workers back in person five days a week. But 42% workers say they would consider quitting if that were the case. Fiverr CEO, Micah Kaufman, joined us now. Fiverr by the way, a platform for freelance workers. Micah, it's good to see you. So there's obviously tension here, right? There is this ongoing tension in the market. How do you think it ends up resolving itself? Thanks for having me on the show again. We're definitely seeing a very polarized view between managers and employees. And I think that if there's something very clear is that managers want this to be 2019 again. And employees cannot move back from having the experience of the past two or three years. And wanting to have more flexibility into the work, I think that some of that is going to be resolved, but the fact that those employees are actually going to leave. And I think in order to receive that level of flexibility, a lot of them are actually going to turn into freelancing, which allows them to define the level of flexibility that they are looking for. OK, so that kind of answers or begins to answer my next question at least, which is where would they go if they did leave? There are still for a lot of the companies that are either in a hybrid or purely virtual reality for their workplace and collaboration. There's still some of the hiring freezes that are in place. Some places looking at cutting and trimming their staff. So where would the opportunities be to still retain that virtual lifestyle, even if going to or looking for other employment opportunities? That's correct. I think that a lot of companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent, are really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. OK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,57,2022-10-12 17:56:36
3148," companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent are really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. And when you think about variable expenses, a lot of it is being answered by free answers. So a lot of the talent that are going to continue looking for that level of flexibility are going to turn into freelancing and we're seeing very high levels of talent coming to us to five or in similar platforms to look for that level flexibility. So Micah, does that mean a recession would mean just a hiring boom for freelancers? I think that at some point yes because again I think that more and more companies are thinking about the shift between fixed and variable expenses. So obviously that is going to fuel. If you go back to the wake of the previous recession right around 2009, we've saw a boom in freelancing. We saw a boom in new business formation and a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full-time employees. So they turn into platforms such as Fiverr to find this talent. Micah, this evening we've got now this proposal, although it's sort of vague on the part of the Biden administration to reclassify workers, which there's some thinking that it might eventually make some workers who are classified as freelance before us to come on the books full-time. Any thoughts on that or the likelihood of that happening and the effect that that could have on your business? Yeah, I think that with the fact that freelancing is becoming a huge force in the workplace, statistics show that by the end of this decade by 2030, 50% of talent is going to be engaging in freelancing in some form or the other. Policy makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort. And I think that in this space we need to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. So if you look at Fiverr as an example, on Fiverr, freelancers have total freedom regarding their work, what they offer when they offer it and from where. So that level of freedom is something that is highly sought for, but it also comes with a price. I mean, you can't lead a totally free lifestyle and then expect to be considered to be full-time employee. In other aspects of gig economy, maybe the situation is slightly different because they have less freedom on what they offer and how much they charge for it. This has been in the making for quite a long time and we're actually working close with policymakers to figure out how the level of how we can level the plain field for freelancers in aspects such as access to affordable medical insurance. But that's it, as I said, if you want to lead the lifestyle that allows you total freedom, you can't also expect to be considered as a full-time employee when you're not. Michael, just while we have you, over the past recessions where the gig economy roles have been available, we've seen this flow into some of the roles for freelancers or even just workers who are looking to kind of take their own employment under their own control. For your business at Fiverr, given some of the investments that you've made into the business to try and unlock these larger projects, more engagement, what from the Fiverr perspective would you be kind of looking towards to really navigate a recession as well yourself as a business? Yeah, so I think that a lot of businesses we've talked about fixed versus variable expenses, I think that a lot of businesses are actually focusing on identifying their core competencies and hiring full-time around those core competencies and looking for the more peripheral areas of expertise and turning into freelancers around those those types of expertise, not could be if your core is technology, maybe something that is nothing your core is going to be marketing or design in which cases that they start to think about how to integrate freelancers into their workflows. And this is why we've seen the appearance of the Chief Freelancer Officer, which is a new role within companies within HR that thinks about how to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,58,2022-10-12 18:00:23
3149," We've seen the appearance of the Chief Freelancer Officer, which is a new role within companies, within HR, that thinks about how to integrate that level of talent into organizations. We're seeing that rising throughout the past few years, and this is accelerating right now. Micah, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Micah Kaufman, who is five or CEO, appreciate it. Thank you. Now, let's get your quick trending ticker. We're sharing some Moderna. Merc shares are watching him. That's after Moderna announced that Merc has exercised an option to jointly develop and potentially sell an mRNA-based cancer vaccine. Merc is going to pay $250 million to exercise the option. That vaccine is being tested. Data on it expected in the fourth quarter of this year. But during a share, surging 10% on that news. A new burn lift shares got hammered yesterday on a potential change to how give workers a classified. We just mentioned it. Stocks are coming back today. Should they be? We'll discuss that next. Next, I will start. The sheriff's Ouberan lift and door dash are back on the rise today after getting slammed on Tuesday. After the Biden administration proposed to change the classification of gig workers that could revise them from independent contractors to employees. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox joins us now for some analysis on this. Stephen, has this now been priced in any potential change that may come in the first half of next year? Is it now fully priced into these stocks? You know, actually I think it's more than priced into this stock. I think regulatory concerns have been sort of the hand-ranging events since these companies went public. And what we've seen is that the companies have been able to manage through these events and actually continue to improve their business model. So I think it's being overdone at this point. Liftus said nothing is immediately going to change about its business model. Just yeah, of course that's what the company would say. Given the fact that yeah, there's still a lot of discussion that has to take place in the near term in order to see any type of reclassification go forward. But what extent should customers at the end of the day, if this does move forward, expect their prices, their fares to also have to be adjusted? Yeah, that's a great point because all the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,59,2022-10-12 18:05:37
3150," All the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what happens at the state level. So companies have been in discussions with various states. I think the most encouraging thing you saw without out of the state of Washington this year, which signed into law and independent contractor plus agreement, which basically allows for some benefits. This IC plus gives the driver's flexibility plus benefits. The companies are working to pass those costs through the customers and also reducing other costs tied to other pieces of the business to offset some higher costs as well. Stephen, as we potentially go into a recession, what effect will that have on the sort of driver service dynamic? In other words, could there potentially be more people who are available to be drivers? Unfortunately, if they're a layoffs or, you know, just do a burn lift get away with paying them less? Like, how is what are going to be all those knock on effects? Yeah, I don't think Uber and Lyft get away with paying them less, especially in this political environment. And I don't think they're looking to pay them less. I think if you go back and look what the companies have done. Forget about what they've said, but what they've done for their drivers, specifically over the last couple years, they've worked to make their expenses come down through various methods. And they've also worked to make their time on the network much more efficient. Obviously, if they're sitting around waiting for a ride, it's not as efficient. So it's really important to step back and say, OK, in a, in a weaker economy, how dependent has the consumer become on these rides share opportunities, whether to drive or also to ride. And so, you know, the real market is still the enterprise. So large companies with multiple pockets of spending on transportation and food delivery as a consolidate those things. Those are real profitable opportunities for lift and Uber that they can also translate into their drivers to make money. And so, you know, a lot of focus on driver utilization to make it more incentivized in order for drivers to actually want to be on the platform and be able to take advantage of more rides. But then there's also the thought of if this goes through and that changes the classification, does that actually make it more intriguing for new drivers to sign up and increase the supply side of this broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major kind of a major delta on prices here for consumers. Yeah, so one of the interesting things that I think Wall Street doesn't appreciate enough is that when you talk about these networks, the companies aren't playing checkers. It's more like three dimensional chess. So when you look at supply versus demand, like take the UK, for instance, where Uber is now providing benefits to the drivers while giving them flexibility. They're cost of going up, but then other costs have gone down in terms of actual providing, you know, looking at driver incentives, for example, they don't have to provide as many. And so they're attracting probably more drivers now passing on some of the cost of the customers, but competition has followed. So you're getting a little bit of that network benefit, I think. How it plays out in the US is going to be on a region by region basis, but generally speaking, I think the companies have a way to manage through this and continue to march towards evict goggles where they've been set, I get lift a new bird. Fox advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox. Thanks so much for the time today, Steve. Thank you. A major headcount reduction is reportedly on the horizon for Intel. Thousands of employees are expected to be laid off, according to Bloomberg as the chipmaker looks to take cost cutting measures.

3151," to things like servers just as we started to see interest rates rise. And that's impacting its bottom line. And so there could be as many as thousands of these kinds of layoffs. The company also is dealing with those kinds of repeated slowdown that we've seen in the PC market. Gartner had said that the market actually collapsed 19.5% in Q3 2022. So it really doesn't look great for Intel at this point. Other chip companies are dealing with the same issues. But Intel is at this point kind of trying to turn itself around. They said that they're going to build that huge mega complex in Ohio. It's not going to look good for employees if they're getting laid off. It does look like the departments are going to be something along lines of marketing and sales. And the company does have more than 100,000 employees. So it's not as though it's clearing house by any stretch of the imagination, but it could be as many as 10% 20% of employees. Yeah, and obviously this is part of the moves that we've been seeing by many of the chip makers. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors officially approved XPO logistics plan separation of its freight brokerage business. The company also named a new CFO. I had the chance to speak to the company's current CEO and founder, Brad Jacobs, about the restructuring at the company. I'm here at the Greenwich Economic Forum with Brad Jacobs, the founder and CEO of XPO logistics, although not for much longer. Brad is great to see you in person. And I said not for much longer, of course, because the company is spinning off RXO, which is logistics business. You just announced what that's effective on November 1st, I believe. So talk to me about what's happening now, what the process feels like, and what investors can expect from the two companies. It's very exciting. After 10 months of working really hard with large number of people working long hours, we're this close to the spin. And we'll create two separate companies that will be an inch wide and a mile deep in what they do. And therefore, they'll likely do it much better. So we'll have a pure play less than truck load business. That'll be XPO. And we'll have a pure play non-asset truck brokerage business called RXO, which is best in class truck broker. It's very exciting. And you're not going to be running the day-to-day business any longer. That's correct. Do you have some plans yet for what the next thing, the next Brad Jacobs chapter is going to be yet? Well, I want to try to repeat what I've done before, which is to have companies that over a 10-year period or so create at least 10 times return on the initial capital. And so I'm not a private equity firm in trying to make two or three X, and let's not make any. I go for things that are 20X, 30X, you know, the big ones. So I'm looking for that. I'm looking for the next big thing. And where any hints of what in what industry or where you think the opportunities are, because especially right now, it's tricky time, right? It's the best time just start a business when valuations are low and there's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about where the economy is going and so forth. That's when you want to get it. That's when you want to buy. When valuations are reasonable and there's not a lot of competition. But I don't know. I'm going to gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking before now about all of the negativity that we're hearing, right? From Ray Dalio to Jamie Dimon, the IMF cutting, it's GDP forecast. All to the Jones and all of it. Yeah, all of it. I mean, you have a really good figure on the pulse of what's going on in the economy because of moving things around. So what are you seeing? I don't always get it right. I often get it right, but not a hundred percent of the time. My take is we're probably, so when you see all these really great minds, I'll come out and universally say, oh, it's really bad coming up. That's usually historically been the final pre-capitulation phase. So everyone agrees that, oh, it's really bad. And then you have the final plunge. That's the time to buy when everybody says, oh, it's down this. It's going to keep going down more. That's the time to do it. So I'm really having my antennas up for it because I don't think this downturn, which is likely to happen, is going to last for a long time. And there's definitely other two things. There's the economy and there's the market. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,61,2022-10-12 18:17:58
3152," There's two things. There's the economy and there's the market. Yes. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see. So the capitulation you're talking about is the market in the market. Yes, the economy might lag that. The economy could lag as the straights go up as quantitative tightening gets tighter. You could see a significant slowing in the economy. But the world has become such a small world and so well informed and so many people understand economics now. It didn't during the great financial crisis. I don't think it'll last long. I think there'll be such pressure to, okay, now we reduced inflation. Okay, now let's get some growth going again. I don't expect a long, long downturn. I expect a short, maybe significant downturn. Now, one of the things that was a detail in the latest jobs report made me think of you. And that had to do with trucker jobs, which fell by 11,000 in the month of September. And I'm just curious what that tells us. The number of truckers hired, I should say, fell by 11,000. A metric that we watch very closely, Julie, is for every truck job, truck driver posting that we post, how many people apply for it? That's about 45% just in the last several months. So there's a lot more people coming back into the job market as the economy gets a little tougher. So there's the pendulum is swinging on that. Don't get me wrong. It's still very tough to hire truck drivers. It's a lot less tough than it was even a few months ago. The inventory climbs that we are seeing, by a lot of, not just the retailers, but in other industries as well. How is that affecting your business and the loads of things that you guys are trucking around? Well, the transportation business does better. The industry is a whole, when inventory is a low, not high. There's more restocking and there's more goods being moved. But what you see right now is really interesting. As a result of all the craziness of the pandemic, people got the wrong, they have a lot of inventory, but it's often the wrong inventory. They have too much of this and too little of that. So there's still a lot of activity. So goods are still flowing. Goods are still flowing, but not as much as more. Not as much. But it's an interesting dichotomy. You observe the same thing. I observed today at the Greenwich Economic Forum. It's pretty downbeat. I'm sure you'd die here. People have their warrior face design. When you talk to my echo chamber is a little bit different. My echo chamber is CEOs of large companies, chief supply chain offices, large companies, entrepreneurs of small businesses who need their goods move. And they're not as negative. They're not as positive as they were say a year ago. They're less positive. But they're generally growing. They're not contracting. They're just growing less. All right, I have one final fun question for you. The Tesla semi. How much is that going to change the trucking industry? It depends on the price point. So we're a partner to one of the big OEMs for their electric vehicle semis. And actually, we call them semis. The semi-conductor semis. The semi-conductor semis. And we call them semis. Sorry. No, I'm being the other way around. But the semis are, they're beautiful. And the truck drivers love them. And they're slick and they're well designed. And they accelerate fast and they're safe. And they've all kinds of gizziness in them. But they're really expensive. And so the economics aren't there yet. Now, if the technology advances in the manufacturing process advances such that they become cost-effective, yeah, it can be very transformative. Makes sense. All right, Brad Jacobs of XPO, thank you so much. It was great to see you in person. Really appreciate it. Pleasure to meet you. Thanks. So it was fun there because Brad was sort of an antidote to a lot of the darkness. I mean, he's not saying everything is wonky-dory and fantastic. But part of it is the force of his personality. Part of it is what he's seeing on the ground. He was a little bit of a counterbalance to some of the worst case scenarios that we're hearing out there. You say tomato. I say tomato. Yeah, exactly. That makes sense. It was interesting to what he said, though, about the Tesla semi-truck. It's going to be fascinating when those trucks eventually hit the road because at some point, it sets the stage for driverless semi-trucks in this country. Yes. But as he said, the price has to come down. Absolutely. For it to make sense, which makes sense. Right. Also, a critical time for the business.

I think we can use these rewards to get that eggo eggnog. So I'm excited about it. No, it doesn't go that way. It goes the other way. So I can't use eggnog. OK. Am I misunderstanding? I understand. Yes. Starbucks points you towards Delta. OK, here's the details. 150 stars, 500 miles when you link those accounts. OK, so you get the double stars on Delta travel days. All right. So if you buy a Starbucks when you're flying on Delta at the airport, you get more stars. And you get one mile per one dollar spent at Starbucks. I have to add a special code and concur. Like, can I use this and concur? I feel like what I need right now is that gift with the guy with the calculations on the board behind him to figure out exactly how this works. It's still better than Duncan. It's still better than what Duncan did this week. I'm still waiting to get my free coffee. I think I have 600 more points to go. It's terrible. OK. I mean, but Starbucks has had one of the better rewards that are out there. And for the companies that have done more digital disruption for that customer touchpoint, I mean, Starbucks. All these companies should just copy Starbucks. Why try to reinvent any of the Starbucks? People love their rewards program. It's a huge driver of their business. Let's take a look at markets. Shall we? We have a mixed picture right now for the major averages, not much movement. It feels like this is a waiting game, both perhaps for FOMC minutes this afternoon at 2 p.m. And also, probably more importantly, for the CPI report that's coming out tomorrow morning. So perhaps a bit of a waiting game and that the market is playing ahead of that. Coming up, the cake of a G.D. is going to speak to the CEO of SunPower on the company's latest partnership with GM also be interested to hear what the inflation reduction act would that company. Don't want to miss that. We'll be back tomorrow. Welcome to Democracy, The Starry campaign.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,64,2022-10-12 18:31:56
3155," Gamers Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm Akiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Sticky inflation, producer prices come in stronger than expected, but stocks in a bit of a holding pattern. I had a tomorrow's key consumer reading. Another hurdle for Amazon workers at a Southern California warehouse file a petition to form a union of vote alone would be a landmark move in the country's largest state. And charging your home with your EV, some power announces a big partnership with general motors on a new home energy system CEO Peter Ferrisy is going to be joining us later this hour. First though, 90 minutes into the trading day, we are checking in on the market action right now. As you see, things trading pretty flat right now, but the NASDAQ down about just slightly there, one tenth of a percent. A number of things that we've been watching this morning, we pointed to PPI coming out, jumping a little stronger than expected, up 0.4% month on month. We're also looking ahead to those FOMC minutes coming out later this afternoon, but of course, all eyes will be on that CPI print coming down tomorrow. Ahead of that, let's do a quick check of where bond yields are right now. We are seeing the 10 year yield still below that 4% level, but we are seeing it inching ever closer at 395 the five year well above that 4% level and the 30 year yield at 3.9%. Now all of this comes as we kick off earnings season, we're starting to get some of those results in with the Big Bang Flitter to report this Friday from",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,65,2022-10-12 18:35:37
3156," Well, at 3.9%. Now, all of this comes as we kick off earning season. We're starting to get some of those results in with the Big Bang Slated to report this Friday. For more on what to expect, we have here with us in studio, Victoria Green, G-Squirt, Private, Wealth, CIO. It's good to have you in person. Absolutely. I know. I feel like we know each other. Yeah. One way, Matt. Yeah, your first time we met, pretty fitting, right? We're talking about earning season. The bar is pretty low going into this. But you say set yourself up for even more disappointment. I do. I really see the market is hitting about 34.32. I mean, Pepsi did surprise on the upside. So maybe that's a little bit of an indicator that expectations have come low enough. But we have the dollar. I mean, the dollar was such a headwind in Q3. And I think you've got a lot of tech companies that are going to struggle. So who's going to do well? Probably the energy companies. We will probably see industrials do OK. We've seen some energy companies are going to continue to print money here at $80 or $90 barrel oil. So I think the sectors are going to matter. Individual company performance is going to matter. And what their CEOs did. But I think it's like you've got to check a box on what EPS is. But I think more so everybody wants to know guidance. What does this look like going forward? How much pressure is it going to happen with the dollar? Who's doing job cuts? I mean, it's expected Intel is going to announce job cuts to follow Microsoft, follow Snap. So we're seeing a lot of job cuts coming in the technology sector. Definitely no risk going to full earning season. Financials really kick it off. And we'll see. Did they pick up net interest income? Or are they having to put too many reserves, not seeing any mortgages? You know, we've definitely seen the mortgages almost grind to a halt. And then investment banking has been just difficult this year. So banks make trouble. So the four looking statements are what we're looking for going into these results. But also, you know, it seems to be still a bit of a debate if you could argue that, that, you know, where exactly we are in terms of the macro picture. You have those comments coming in from President Biden saying that he doesn't expect a recession. Obviously, he's the president. He's not going to say things are going to get worse. But we also got those comments from Jamie Dimon, which seems to suggest there are more rough patches ahead. How do you view that? So I think the fact the president said the R word, you know, if you're a fan of the show West Wing with a bagel word, you know, that nobody wants to say the R word is bagel time. But the fact the president is acknowledging it might be a slight recession. And that has to mean they're even acknowledging the slowdown is coming, the Fed's acknowledged the slowdown is coming. They're trying to slow it down, the slowdown inflation. I'm with Jamie Dimon. I actually think we're in a recession. I know we can argue the definition of recession. And that's technically Nebers job. But if you look at the slowdown, where we're going with growth, what's happening with inflation? What's happening with the hawkers fed? Definitely on Jamie Dimon's that there's a little more pain coming. Not sure I'm full IMF, right? They came out with like, hey, expect another 20% down like there's more pain coming. Everybody's going to feel recession in 23. Feel like that might be a tad draconian at this point. But I do think we're still going to see the effects. Remember the lag between rate hikes. And when we feel in the labor market, it's about 12 months. So the question is, where do you position yourself if that slowdown is already underway? You've been bullish on energy for quite some time. And there's questions right now, especially with the moves that we saw from OPEC last week about whether things are really going to start to take up. And when we have seen them tick up a little, where are you positioned in some of those big names? Sure. We did actually pull a little bit back to energy, but we're still overweight. We were very, very overweight. We pulled that back a little bit in June. But we still like a lot of it. So we like the USEMPs, right? The to get it out of the ground in the Permian area is about $30, $40 a barrel. And you haven't seen the rig count really jump up. We're at 765 total rigs. We're still below pre-piontubic levels. And the US has now become a net exporter of petroleum products because we are picking up market share from what Russia is stepping back in. And there are some big sanctions coming in December from the EU. And it's going to hit the shipping and the tankers, because they're not going to insure them. And if nobody's insuring an oil cargo, which I believe something like 95% of insurance is issued by the UK in the euro area. So I see opportunity in US energy producers. We liked our Devon, Devon, Diamondback announced the acquisition today. We really like the Shaneer. It's a natural gas exporter. We think the gas story. Because we feel like the story of energy security for the next decade. Yes, EVs are coming. Yes, solar is coming. Have we hit peak oil demand? We'll see. But we also see also the slit that we need people buying energy from all of us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,66,2022-10-12 18:40:00
3157," Yes, EVs are coming, yes, solar's coming. Have we hit peak oil demand? No, we'll see. But we also see also the slit that we need people buying energy from allies. You know, when we're dealing with that with Saudi Arabia right now, that is Saudi Arabia really an ally, or to sound like millennial self. Are they a friend of me? Like we're friends with them a little bit, but in reality we're not really. And if you look at the geopolitical macro view, you have maimed your players that we may have massive political shifts in. We have Saudi Arabia. We have Iran and we have Venezuela. And we're slightly not saying this is a grand decision and picking sides here, but we're slightly warming up to Venezuela because we realize how to Arabia really is not working in our best interests right now. Yeah, I mean, we did hear the President comment on the yesterday suggesting that there could be more moves coming against Saudi Arabia on the back of that decision. So energy, it sounds like you're still, you pulled back a bit, but you're still positive on it in this environment. What are some other names that you think are getting overlooked right now that offer real value? So, and I love my Costco. I'll talk about Costco anytime I can get it. I love my Costco. Not a stock itself. I'm talking about the company. And not even the $1.50 hotdog, but they are also picking up inventory. So this second Amazon Prime Day that we've gotten is not just because Amazon is trying to be nice to us. They're trying to dump inventory. Everybody's got inventory. Nike's got inventory. So the Costco's and the TJ Maxx of the world that are kind of the off brand, they're not beholden to any brand names. So they're picking up cheap inventory and they're moving it. They're a discount store. They're 75% in the US. The bulk of their international exposures, Canada, which has held up better. So I think they're going to have a little bit less currency effects. I like them. I like a really boring name IBM. I think they're a great place to hide. They've got a strong dividend yield. I think as a service, then a tech company goes, tech spending, it's going to continue. And because of the way they're positioned, I think they're going to see a little bit more sustainability in revenues. Because that's what we're looking at right now. As we move forward and things get pressured, who's going to still make money? And who's at risk of being cut? And so I think they're very well positioned. They're reasonably valued. But I think they still have a lot of growth. They changed who they were. And people realize IBM is a very old company. But they redeveloped themselves multiple, multiple times. They sold off Lenovo, got out of the PC business, and now they're in the hybrid cloud and AI and data consulting. And I see data and data and health care as a great place to be. And the last place playing defense is health care. Like a United Health. Great name to be in right now. And again, a little bit less effect with the dollar. So some of these names that have more revenues coming from the US, I think also will hold up a little bit better. Yeah, names from three very different sectors. But diversification is what we keep hearing. Victoria Green, good to have you in studio today. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. Joining us from G-Spray Private Wealth. Well, let's take a look at oil now. As OPEX last year's its forecast for global crude demand. Yahoo, finances, Jared Blickery here. With more on the price action, Jared, I guess, in some ways. This is OPEX Wave justifying that cut that we got last week. I think so. That took the administration also, the Democrats by surprise. In fact, a lot of people surprised by that because a slash of 2.1 million barrels per day is a lot. Now, OPEX Plus has been operating under capacity. So it's really only an effective cut of about 1 million barrels per day. That is still a lot. And it has house Democrats up in arms. And some of the Senator, Senate leaders as well, Dick Durbin, offering up some bills that have been offered previously in the year, and these have to do with the potential altering the relationship that the U.S. has with Saudi Arabia. We know the U.S. just visited. President Biden just visited Saudi Arabia. But all of this is one month ahead of the midterm. So we know how that, we know how gas prices and energy prices factor into politics. So not surprising to see this. But I believe there is a resolution introduced by 3 Democrats that would suspend military operations and protections in Saudi Arabia and also some sales of arms. And that's a huge deal. There's $100 billion in active tickets with respect to the U.S. and defense systems out there with respect to Saudi Arabia. Now here are crude oil futures. In today, you can see just kind of sinking here after the 8 AM hour. But here's a year to date. We just climbed above 91 dollars per barrel, but still well in the lower end of this range. We just broke out. And so with energy as the leading sector here, you got to ask yourself, and I'm going to go to our sector action and put a year to date on it. With energy, the leading sector, what are the options here? Victoria Green, our previous guest, mentioning that a lot of these companies, these energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,67,2022-10-12 18:44:14
3158," go to our sector action and put a year to date on it. With energy-leading sector, what are the options here? Victoria Green, our previous guest, mentioning that a lot of these companies, these energy companies, are minting money. And with respect to the supply situation of Saudi Arabia isn't playing ball. Guess what? Venice will. She mentioned them too. They have some of the largest holdings of oil reserves in the entire world. And they are on this side of the world in the West. So maybe we're going to see some increase in terms of interest with respect to repairing those foreign relations. And maybe easing some of those sanctions, I believe Chevron still has a presence there. So we'll have to see what comes of this. XLE, by the way, is still up 43% for the year. OK, Jared Blickrey, thanks so much for that. Well, Pepsi, PepsiCo seeing a big boost after the food giant blew away profit estimates with free-to-lay North America powering PepsiCo's net revenue. Take a look at the stock there, up nearly 5%. The company also raising its forecast, now expecting its full-year organic revenue to increase 12%. We've got our very own Brian Sasi here with outfit change from the last hour. I just put out a place. This is my outfit I watch on Sunday football. You know, I feel a little peppy Max, bubbles and black and ice, and you're good to go. Which is fitting because we're talking about snacks. Turns out snacks are pretty resilient even in the face of cost rises. Yeah, you know, I don't want to bury the lead here. Bottom line is we talked to PepsiCo, CFO Hugh Johnson. He said, hey, y'all, finance team, we're pushing through price increases because we're still dealing with high levels of inflation. And despite those price increases, people are still out there buying lots of chips and lots of soda. Take a listen. Okay, I guess we don't have that. We don't have that, but still, Johnson came out. Really, I think struck a bullish tone. So in addition to that, really saying how he, he just implemented more price increases in the fourth quarter. What he did not want to do is really provide any 2023 guidance. That is typically what PepsiCo does. He did not provide that on the conference call, but ultimately said that's not where they're going to go yet too. We were just also showing pictures of Gatorade. I would expect a big push by Gatorade more into the energy drink category next year. They will launch that what they're calling their new fast-twitch product, 200 milligrams of caffeine in the early part of next year in partnership with the NFL. That's basically- 200 milligrams of that. Oh, right on my alley. Oh, I'm so psyched to keep going. I can't wait. You're gonna have more than one of those, right? Oh, you better go. I mean, you know, when you talk about those cost increases, and how much of it is it to offset? I mean, it's clearly there to offset the price increases they're seeing internally from the materials, everything that goes into making all these stacks, but at the same time, is it enough to offset what they're seeing internally? Yeah, they have, I would say they have. Pepsi was out here this morning with, I think, an earnings beat. Nobody on the street expected. That's why the stock is ripping higher here for Pepsi on an earnings day. That's a pretty big move. That's why it's the hottest ticker on the Yow Finance platform. This quarter's positively surprised a lot of folks on the street over the next coming days. I would not be surprised to see upgrades on Pepsi co-stock upgrades and price targets, upgrades and earnings estimates because it's clear that they have pricing power. And I think the focus now turns onto Coca-Cola to see if they report more of the same. First instinct is yes, you will probably see a very strong quarter from Coca-Cola. The only red flag I would call out is maybe more currency exposure for Coca-Cola than Pepsi-Cola, but still Coca-Cola is teed up for a very strong quarter. Now, yeah, currency exposure one. We're going to continue to hear throughout the earnings season. Brian Sasi, thanks so much. Thanks. Well, shares of Intel aren't focused today as the company reportedly considers major job cuts. That stock is up right now, but it did hit a new 52 week low today. Bloomberg reporting the chipmaker plans to announce the reductions around its quarterly results on October 27. News of the cuts come as the company sees declining demand for its products, especially its PC processors. It's a key revenue driver for the company. Bloomberg reports the revetions could be as high as 20% of staff in some divisions. Well, coming up from changing our office to watching the office meta labels the Quest Pro, a powerful device for productivity and announces tie-ups with Microsoft and NBC Universal. Dan Halley is going to break down the announcement for us on the other side. MUSIC",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,68,2022-10-12 18:49:17
3159," Whats going on? Swim. Eat. Well, meta has unveiled its new virtual reality headset with a price tag and an eye-watering $1,500. The device isn't aimed at gamers, it's being more positioned as a work-use tool. Those credentials bolster by an appearance from Microsoft's very own CEO Satya Nadella at the big event. Yaku Finance's Dan Halley has all of the details. I guess you could argue the device is a little less clunky, but let's talk about the technology and how this helps meta accelerate their vision of the metaverse. Does it, though, I don't know if it does. This is a $1,500 headset. It's really geared towards professionals. As you said, it's not really geared towards gamers. Part of the developers' conference that they were running had a huge focus on gamers and how they want to bring more game developers in and talk about how they're offering more and that game developers are making billions or rather millions through the platform. They really did put that heavy emphasis on gaming. The headset, though, as you said, seemed to be focused more on the idea of work and being able to have these kind of meetings in the metaverse where you can sit down with people from around the world and easily chat without having to do it via video conference, which I'm not sure that too many people will find that super appealing when they have to strap a headset on that is heavier than the current quest, albeit according to people who have used it, a little bit better weighted and less hot. It really was kind of a mixed bag. The technology is supposed to be better with better visuals, better graphics, improved lenses, there's the ability to see the outside world in color. You could do that sort of with the quest, too, but not really with full color at all. It really does ring to be seen if this is actually going to start pushing the metaverse idea forward still seems like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,69,2022-10-12 18:52:29
3160," You could do that sort of with the quest too, but not really with full color at all. So yeah, it really does ring to be seen if this is actually going to start pushing the metaverse idea forward. It still seems like it's quite a ways off before it becomes something that, you know, the average consumer says, you know, I gotta go out and get this headset and then use it all the time because, you know, they've sold something like 10 million headsets or more, but how often are they being used as I think the real question? And how often are people picking them up, going back daily and jumping in to do things like, you know, check email, talk to people, access kind of, you know, the big displays that you might get in the metaverse when, you know, instead you could just fire it for computer and do that quicker. Yeah, I mean, it is about that transition we talked about so much. It's not so seamless going from the real world to the virtual world, although I have to say, Dan, I'm just really excited that Avatar's getting lights. You can talk about that. I mean, that's a good sign, right? Technology's advancing. We talked about Satya Nadella making a surprise appearance. There, what's this partnership about between meta and Microsoft? Yeah, so this is about their team's mesh software and it's really, you know, they're both going hard as far as the ability to get this kind of work into the metaverse where you can sit down and have meetings with people, chat with them around a virtual conference table. You know, Microsoft already offers a team's chat where you can do video chatting with your colleagues through your laptop or your smart phone. So, you know, it just kind of feels odd that you can fire up something so easily that you can carry with you and have conversations with people. Sure, you're not around a virtual conference table. You're not able to virtually whiteboard the way you might want to although there is a whiteboard feature for video chatting with Microsoft teams when you do use the laptop. But, you know, it does kind of point to how both companies don't want to miss the boat on what could potentially be a big piece of hardware and software down line just like they did with the smartphone. You remember Facebook tried to launch a phone. Microsoft had their phone line, Windows OS, mobile OS, wasn't as bad as people thought. But they also did lean into gaming. So part of Microsoft's X Cloud, their Cloud Gaming platform will be available on the quest. And so you see this kind of, you know, balance between, or attempt to balance between gamers and people who are working. It feels as though they're trying to make a PC when the PC already exists. This one you just have to put on your head. All this of course coming as a medic kind of keeps the close watch in their rear view mirror, right? With Apple, expect us to come out with our headset soon. Dan Halley is always thanks so much for that. We are continuing to monitor some of those layoffs coming out of Warner Brothers Discovery. This is all part of the company's drive to cut costs. It's now affecting the Warner Brothers TV studio. Yahoo! Finance is Ali Canal following that story for us and Ali, do we have a sense of just how many job cuts are coming? Yeah, we do. Yesterday we got the announcement that the TV studio has been affected. That segment cut 26% of its head count, AKA 125 positions across scripted, unscripted, and animation. And that translated to 82 staffers being laid off. And then the company opted not to fill an additional 43 vacant positions. But there's another big cut that the company made. They are shuttering their digital production arms, stage 13. And the 40 year Warner Brothers Television workshop. And this is a big one because this fostered new, diverse talent. There was a lot of talk on Twitter. Why are they deciding to cut this when there was so much diversity? That was coming out of that program. So that is now done. And obviously this comes at a pretty crucial time for the company. They are trying to cut $3 billion worth of costs over the next two years. We saw back in August that they cut 14% of their HBO Max work for. So this is just a continuation of those expected layoffs. I think we will see more throughout the fall. But if you take a look at the stock, it's trading near 52 week lows. Down more than 50% year to date. David Zazov has been very aggressive. But I think investors are still in a bind to his vision. So I think once all this consolidation happens, once we get that newly combined HBO Max discovery plus streaming program next summer, the next step is going to be, OK, David Zazov, where are you going to take this company and will investors ultimately buy into it? Yeah, maybe investors are waiting for this shake down to all play out. The other company, of course, in this streaming space, Netflix, the big giant here reporting next week. What are we expecting there? What's interesting?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,70,2022-10-12 18:56:52
3161," This is just waiting for this shakedown to all play out. The other company, of course, in this streaming space, Netflix, the big giant here reporting next week. What are we expecting there? What's interesting about this earnings report is for the first time in a long time, I don't think subscriber numbers are going to be the B all end all. If we take a look at the numbers here, Netflix says it expects revenue at $7.85 billion adjusted EPS at $2.22 a share. They expect that subscriber number to come in at $1 million. I actually think they might even be on that subscriber number due to the success of Dahmer. That series has just been crushing it week after week on the Netflix top 10 list. But going back to what's happening at the company right now, ad supported, that is going to be a big driver. There's been a lot of optimism on Wall Street. We've seen a lot of upgrades. The stock is up 18% over the past three months, widely outpacing the broader market. We still have a couple bears in there that say there's a lot of volatility. There's a lot of competition. We have Disney's out supported coming out in December. People are saying that Netflix could come out with theirs November 1st to beat Disney to the punch. But right now, I think ultimately analysts are really hoping for some more clarity on the ad supported and they're really banking on that to help Netflix improve their free cash flow and profitability. So that's going to be probably the biggest question that investors want answered during the earnings call in the report. You think that people will be a little more cautious in this environment in terms of which advertisers would be willing to pay up, but I guess that points to the attractiveness of the platform that at least, you know, the analysts see if they're upgrading it because the additional revenue source they expect to come in. And that's been some of the bear sentiment too because Netflix is charging a really high premium to a lot of these advertisers. So if they even want to be on the platform, they're paying above industry standard and that could be a risk. Yeah, an important point to point out there. Ali Canal, thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, the sustainability conundrum. We're from major governments, Trillian's worth of assets, and now a new report saying supply cannot keep up with demand. But isn't there backlash against ESG? We'll discuss next. Thank you. Great. Thank you. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,71,2022-10-12 19:01:12
3162," you you you you Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this one day afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs and Richella Kufo. Let's get you up to speed on the market action. We are looking at gains at least when you take a look at the Dow and the S&P or a Dow and the Nasdaq excuse me the Dow up about 60 points. S&P now back in negative territory. The Nasdaq though holding onto gains barely of just five points taking a look at this intraday chart. You did see this spike shortly after 2 PM after we got the Fed minute release. So it looks like the Fed minutes weren't as hawkish as what the street had maybe been bracing themselves force. That's why we're still in the green today, although well off the highs of the day, Russell 2000 moving to the upside up just about nearly two tens of a percent taking a look at the bond yields yield pulling back a bit as investors seem to get a little bit more hawkish if we could say that the 10 year yield now at 390 the 30 year yield at 389. Take a look at the sector action today and this really gets into what exactly is going on in the markets energy. The leader here up just around 1% but consumer staples also among the outperformers here up just around 8 tens of a percent. The reason why was earnings that we got out from Pepsi earlier today and take a look at some of those beverage names. You can see Pepsi leading the way with just around a 4% jump here to the upside better than expected earnings on the top and bottom lines. They also raised their guidance competitor Coca-Cola moving to the upside today as well as some of some the bigger beer names here. Budweiser you can see up just around 2% and Moulsen Quars also moving to the upside up nearly 3%. I mentioned the minutes from the Fed meeting. That's a big driver here in this afternoon's trading. Yahoo! Finance is Jen Schomburger has the latest on that. Hey Jen. Good afternoon, Shana. Many Fed officials felt that the cost of doing too little to cool inflation versus the cost of doing to outweigh the cost of doing too much according to internal policy deliberations amongst Fed officials at their meeting 3 weeks ago. Now several participants felt the need to maintain a restrictive stance for as long as necessary with a couple stressing that historical experience showed the danger of prematurely ending periods of tight monetary policy. Now at the time, Fed officials remained thought that inflation remained unacceptably high, noting that inflation data had come in above expectations and was declining more slowly than anticipated. Several participants pointed to continued elevated rate of the increase in�",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,72,2022-10-12 19:04:52
3163," on above expectations and was declining more slowly than anticipated. Several participants pointed to continued elevated rates of the increase in core goods prices. That is prices excluding those volatile food and energy prices. Now, most fed officials feel that some interest rate sensitive sectors like housing and business fixed investment have started to respond to rate hikes, but that a large portion of sectors in the economy have yet to. Now, as monetary policy titans further, officials think that they can slow the pace of rate hikes at some point and assess the impact of those rate hikes that have already been implemented on inflation. Many officials felt that once the policy rate had reached as efficiently restrictive level, they would maintain that level for, quote, some time until there was, quote, compelling evidence that inflation was on force to return to that 2% objective. Now, many officials expect the economy to grow at a pace below trend this year and for the next couple of years as they expect these interest rate hikes to filter through the economy. Guys. All right, thanks for that update, Gen Sean Berger reporting there. Well, let's bring in now Amy Kong, Barrett asset management chief investment officer, and Wells Fargo economist Mike Puglesi to break some of this down. So, Amy, as you sort of pass through the comments that we heard from the third and obviously, we saw that this hawkish toe and they are waiting for this consistent sign that inflation is going down. What does this mean for markets right now? Yeah, I think the trappiness continues until the third really gives us a little bit more insight into their end goal. I don't think they know what the end goal is because they are very data dependent. So, really going into the rest of this year and into 2023, what we're really watching for is inflation trends to moderate and to some earlier comments sustained at a much lower level until we get to that point. I would definitely expect elevated market volatility. Mike, these words, the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook seem to sound a bit dovish to some. It seems to me that the Fed has been remarkably consistent. What did you hear today? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the message I heard is the Fed knows there's still a lot of work left to be done. Inflation remains well above their target and as so long as that's the case, they're going to continue to tighten monetary policy or at least leave it in very restrictive levels. But what I think you're starting to hear is a Fed that recognizes it may not need to be as aggressive with the pace as it was when rates were back at zero, right? Back in March or May when rates were very, very low still in terms of the federal funds rate, there was a lot of ground between where they were and where they needed to go to get policy restrictive. With short-term interest rates now above 3%, and potentially headed above 4% in the very near future, I think you're starting to hear a Fed that slowly but surely is calibrating to both ends of the risk spectrum, obviously not doing enough, but also potentially with rates getting to 4 or even 5% over the next few meetings, you know, worrying about doing too much. Well, Mike, and on that note, worry about doing too much. That certainly is the sentiment of some investors out there saying that the Fed is simply going to overshoot. Is there any risk of that? And I guess to what degree is that risk? Yeah, I do. And in fact, we put a recession in our base case forecast back in June based off that exact thinking with the idea being if the Fed wants to see not just lower inflation from month or two months, but on a sustained basis. And given the extent to which inflation is at best a concurrent indicator and, you know, at worst lagging, we're probably going to see a mild downturn in the economy. Now, it doesn't mean it has to happen that way if they can catch a few lucky breaks related to supply chains and COVID and the war in Ukraine and other factors that have been, you know, very unlucky breaks on the inflation fronts. You know, that could help them achieve the much desired soft landing, but, you know, I do think there is a very real possibility that what will happen in reality is a mild recession starting next spring or summer. And Amy, as we're looking at what's happening with the strength of the dollar, how do you see that playing into the Fed's thinking going forward? Sure. You know, the strength of the US dollar may, you know, certainly cause the Fed to think about the aggressiveness that they have been taking on the markets, but I don't necessarily think that they will pivot all too much from their aggressive stance. I do agree with Mike's comments, though, in the sense that, you know, we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,73,2022-10-12 19:09:41
3164," that they have been taking on the markets. But I don't necessarily think that they will pivot all too much from their aggressive stance. I do agree with Mike's comments though, in the sense that we are at a point where we are now back at pre-COVID levels from the standpoint of where interest rates are. So really, I think the Fed needs to really understand how that cumulative impact is on the economy. They've now raised three times at 75 basis points. I'll likely do it again in November. So you're looking at four very aggressive rate heights. What's the tone they want to set for December and into 2023? I think they're going to weigh that a lot more carefully now that we are again back at pre-COVID levels from the interest rates standpoint. And Mike, you talk about catching a lucky break. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine is ramping up. China continues to lock down and inflation is sticking around. That being said, what's your strategy to these conditions? Cash is king? Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, in these kinds of conditions, you've seen asset prices just across the board. Be it equities, be it obviously longer term bonds, even home prices have started to roll over recently. And so you start to think about where we're getting in short-term interest rates. The Fed does in fact go 75 basis points in November, which we also think is going to be the case. You're going to be talking about a 4% return on relatively safe assets like treasuries where you don't have all that much interest rate risk, you don't have the credit risk. And so I think until we get a lot more certainty on inflation finally rolling over and the Fed at least ramping down to 50 and 25 basis point of eight tax, let alone actually outright pausing, it's going to be very difficult. And I think in that kind of environment, you do want to play cautiously. Amy, what happens to earnings in all this? Because estimates have been lowered. Yet we got Pepsi out this morning beating on both the top and bottom line raising their guidance. Do you think this is a start of a trend or is Pepsi simply most likely an outlier? It's very soon to tell Pepsi is really one of the first major companies to report. We will see from some of the banks coming in the coming days, whether or not they start to build a reserve. We started to see that with Jake Morgan and maybe other banks will follow suit. I think it's again too soon to call a trend at this point. Pepsi's earnings were certainly very good, but one note to keep in mind is that they didn't guide into 2023. So while they do think the rest of the year will pan out nicely for them, I think the key is to listen for clues in terms of what 2023 earnings will look like. Our stance is that as we get into the Q3 earnings season and into January and February, we will start to hear those numbers come down. And we do expect that 240 in terms of what's the street now thinks as the peak in our next year is likely to come south to probably in the low 200s. All right. What do you see as some of the bell whether earnings reports that you're going to be keeping an eye on? Yeah, I think the financials are a great example as well, just given that one, they're so early. And two, it provides insight into the US economy as a whole, either from, you know, you can think about it just from loan growth and what's the demand for credit right now, particularly given the sharp rise and interest rates we've seen over the past few months, or just credit conditions more broadly. What are we seeing? You know, what are banks seeing on the consumer side? What are they seeing from a credit quality standpoint? So that's certainly what'll be front and center for me over the next couple of weeks, both in terms of the timing and the information provided. Okay, Mike Poblisi and Amy Kong. Thank you both. Appreciate all that. We're just getting started here on Yahoo Finance live. Coming up as mortgage rates hit their highest levels since 2006. To find out where housing prices are dropping the fastest.

3165," now Clearly, the Fed is not beating inflation yet, but they are winning the war against an overheated housing market today. Some new numbers showing mortgage demand slowing yet again. Mortgage applications decreased 2% from the prior week that's according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. These higher rates now at 6.81% on the 30 year highest since 2006 really took a hit on demand for refiase though down 86% from the same week last year. Question now is there any good news amidst all this housing carnage? It's a glimmer some deals can be had. Realtor.com out with the 10 cities where prices are falling the fastest and topping that list. In Texas where listen to this prices are down 10% plus since June. Phoenix, Arizona just behind them at 9.9%. Palm Bay, Florida Charleston, South Carolina, Ogden, Utah, they round down to top 5. Denver, Stockton, California, Durham, North Carolina, Spokane, Washington, also in the top 10. You might think those are the 10 cities where prices grew the fastest in the pandemic. That's not necessarily the case, Jonathan, there certainly is some overlap, notably Phoenix, Austin and Denver. But most of those cities were in Florida where prices are not falling that fast because we're still flocking to the tax rate. Look at Ken Griff and Citadel, they're calling it Wall Street, South Beach. A lot of people still keeping those prices high. Yeah, there certainly is a lot of demand in Florida. We talk about this cooling housing market and it's very important to pour out even though Wall Street has been lowering their expectations. For example, Morgan Stanley saying that home prices are going to drop between now and the end of 2023 by about 7%. That puts us right back to where we were at the beginning of this year, January 2022. When prices were still very elevated historically speaking. So we are starting to see a flow down, demand is starting to fall off a bit. A lot of that has to do with the higher mortgage rates that you were just referencing. But it's important to point out, Michelle, that on a pricing basis, we are still very elevated when you compare it to what we were seeing pre-pandemic. And as Dave was mentioning there, it is a regional issue. Obviously, a lot of the places that we saw that were really thriving during the pandemic as people wanted to be warm and we also had people working from home wanted some options. It's interesting though, because different parts of Florida sort of coming back at different places and then when you also look at some of these other bank predictions, you mentioned",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,75,2022-10-12 19:18:22
3166," people working from home wanted some options. It's interesting though because different parts of Florida sort of coming back at different paces. And then when you also look at some of these other bank predictions, you mentioned Morgan Stanley also Goldman Sachs saying that they expect home prices to fall between 5% and 10% next year. Wells Fargo putting it at about just over 5% as well. But then when you look at Zillow, they're actually expecting prices to go up. Now, I'm sure they're hoping that's the case, given that that's the business that they're in. But the big banks are expecting some cooling in the market. And so if you're a first time home viral and you got stuck in a very expensive rental, at least perhaps some good news, but you're going to have to wait about a year for it. Yeah, people think we've got a lot further to fall. Mortgage rates will climb above 7%. We could be looking at 2020, early 21 type of home prices. So you're going to take a further hit in what you have into your house right now. The interesting part about we talked about mortgage demand dropping off 2% from the week prior. It's picking up on adjustable rate mortgages. People taking a bit of a risk on those five year fixed. After that, your subject to market rates. And that we are seeing quite a big demand. People betting on rates down the road. I think in this environment, probably worth the chance for a lot of homeowners. Yeah, and we talked about the slowdown that we're seeing in the US. Obviously, this is also true on a global scale. It was interesting. UBS was also out with a recent report highlighting what they're what they're calling the riskiest cities for real estate. So Toronto actually top that list. Frank Firth, those were the top two. Miami was the only US city in that top 10 list at number 10, which I've had a little bit interesting, right? Risky. Risky. Not buying it. Miami will stay hot. They might lose a few percentage points, but we are flocking to the no state income tax. That would be fun. Certainly is a lot of demand, at least for right now. All right, well, coming up here, the self-described anti-woke YOLL ETF making its Wall Street debut yesterday. With the rise of politically driven funds, say about the broader market, we've got that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,76,2022-10-12 19:22:34
3167," Pennsylvania Ken08 John Ken08 in the South New Israel The best for the future. Consumer Staples among the leaders here in today's gains after Pepsi posted a beat on both the top and bottom lines. They're full a year forecasting. Look at some of these numbers. Organic revenue up 16% growth there. The growth was also broad based North America and also global markets each delivering that 16% growth snacks were of 20% beverages were up 12% we had the CFO Hugh Johnston on Yahoo Finance earlier today and he was basically saying that Pepsi has historically done well even into a recession so Michelle maybe that explains the strong numbers here. I think the question though for Wall Street as we do see the strong report come out of Pepsi Pepsi leading the way for this current quarter whether or not this is going to be a trend maybe earnings aren't going to be as weak as we had initially expected or rather if Pepsi will simply be an outlier here. It's interesting obviously we're still very early in the earnings season but perhaps this speaks to the consumer that they're not pulling away from brand loyalty they are sticking with some of these brands. Obviously Pepsi also owns Doritos, Gatorade and a number of other brands as well and consumers clearly still sticking with that loyalty and still willing to spend a premium for some of these brand names versus say some of these store brands we know that during as recession as inflation has peaked people have turned to some of these grocery store brands but as we're seeing consumer staples still going strong at the moment as we're looking at some of the ones on the screen at Coca-Cola Pepsi, Tyson's Campbell and Kellogg enjoying some gains today showing that people aren't pulling back at least on some of these things despite high inflation day. Yeah and Sean asked which of those things will happen I'm just going to go with yes because overall I think Pepsi is going to continue to grow snacks and beverages we'll continue to be recession proof because they've talked about raising their prices has not impacted one bit the demand in fact their CEO says our category seems to be going faster than food food is going faster than non food I don't think that's going to change in spite of all the ups and downs potentially economically around the world I don't think overall they're going to be the rule of what we see in the quarter with the exception of booze my friends till array we we really focused on the earnings in terms of being a Canadian cannabis company they saw their cannabis revenue down 9% the quarter guess what booze was up 33% the quarter cannabis down nine booze up 33% we saw that with constellation brands as well it said their recession resistant and the demand has not dropped off so again yes I guess would be my oh yeah and I also think it's interesting just a commentary that we've gone out from Wall Street so far web bush was out saying that this is a positive re through on expectations for the broader sector for the broadage that broader beverage sectors that points to what you were saying just in terms of non alcoholic and alcoholic beverage companies here and also Pepsi was raised to a strong buy at CFRA at 12% upside there after the earnings be on both the top and bottom line so the streets encouraged I hope this is a trend but we'll see we love our snacks all right environment social and governance or ESG funds seeing considerable investment in the last several years and though interest has Wayne slightly this year to spurned a counter movement into a so-called anti woke funds with holdings in fossil fuels manufacturing and the like joining us now is vetifies financial futures Dave Nadeg for this ETF report sponsored by investment go QQQ so you can invest in the anti ESG movement now right yeah absolutely we've got a couple different versions of this from funds that are sort of mechanically looking at the individual stocks that are skipped by ESG to this new fund y'all which launched today which is an actively managed fund that isn't pretending that it's trying to go anti ESG as much as anti left so it's it's really positioning itself against companies who take any political so few right well that's my first guess well they don't actually say that what they say is mostly they're going to avoid companies that speak out on social issues that's the big one we do have another ETF drill from from a strive financial which is specifically going after those fossil fuel companies with the idea of voting for the ones that are and voting the shares of those individual stocks to promote more energy drilling so I think you've got a lot of different ways to skin that cap but the ESG side of the equation is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,78,2022-10-12 19:28:57
3168," for the ones that are and voting the shares of those individual stocks to promote more energy drilling. So I think you've got a lot of different ways to skin that cap, but the ESG side of the equation isn't going anywhere. There's still an enormous amount of money chasing that as well. And Dave Rochelle here, I know you obviously people have invested in things that they believe in or that they support. So that aspect of it is something that's not necessarily new, but you say this actually might trivialize some of these issues. Why is that? Well, so when we look at the broad ESG universe, this is being driven by institutions and it's not a small amount of money. There's a PWC study just came out suggesting that we're going to grow from $15 to $30 trillion in the US focused on ESG investing. So the amounts of money we're talking about in some of the reactionary products here are pretty de minimis compared to the institutional money, which is going to continue to allocate based on ESG and which frankly is being rewarded for that. I mean, ESG is outperforming in most reasonable time frames, maybe not the last three months. But if you look over the, you course it this year or the last three years or the last five years, many of these ESG funds are actually beating their benchmarks. Interesting. So Dave, it sounds like you're expecting this, this pullback that we're seeing in ESG investing to at some point bounce back. What do you think that catalyst is going to be? Well, I think we're not really going to see much of a pullback in terms of that asset flow. In terms of the sort of the narrative around this, the political environment for it, I think that this will probably die down. I think I'm absolutely for people voting with their dollars if they don't want to be with an ESG asset manager. You shouldn't be with an ESG asset manager. That's a reasonable approach to take. But the big horse here is still that institutional market. A lot of it outside the US, that's going to be invested in US companies based on ESG principles, regardless of what the US retail investor might do with ETFs. This is a bit of a U-turn, but do you think the impact of these Republican attorneys' general will have an impact on the ESG investment space? They are taking this all the way. Yeah, I'm skeptical of that. If you look at, for instance, what they did in Texas, where they were trying to sort of black ball, black rock. It made for great headlines. When you went under the hood, it was a really diminimous amount of money that was going to be pulled from black rock. And in fact, if you got under the hood, they had to do a whole carve out because black rock was running their energy fund, their private equity energy fund. So this is a big, complicated industry. It makes for a great headline to say we're firing black rock, but it doesn't actually move the needle in terms of getting more drills in the ground or really even changing the cost of capital much. Well said. Dave, what about some of the returns that we're seeing on some of these anti-woke investments and ETFs? It doesn't end up being worth it, as you said. If you do have companies like Blackwink that are already doing business with some of these companies, perhaps, but making the headlines nonetheless. Yeah. Well, so one of the great things, also frustrating things about ESG, is it's very much in the eyes of the beholder. What I think of as ESG might not be with somebody else thinks. When we think about carbon, that's an easy one to understand. Investing or not investing or anti-investing in the net zero carbon transition, that's a pretty clean way of thinking about it. When you start layering on things like social issues, governance issues, honestly, I think the numbers get much harder to tease out. The carbon impact stuff, it's pretty unequivocal that the long-term returns have been positive there. 60% of institutions report that their ESG investments are outperforming consistently their non-ESG investments. Quickly, the currency hedging we can now invest in that space, what's the move? Well, people have been avoiding this and I don't really understand why. If you look at just domestic markets like EFA versus the HEFA, the hedged version, it's being a by 10% this year, just by being currency hedged. We saw this a decade ago with Japan, DXJ, a fund that really rallied way more than Japanese market because it hedged it out. We're in a similar market, but investors don't want to be international at all. That's the problem. We've seen net outflows from international investing in ETFs. So while a hedge diversion might be a better way, they're so little appetite for international diversification, it's not picking up a bid. Well, certainly an opportunity there. Big thank you to Dave Nadeg, Vetifies Financial Futures. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Thanks for having me. You're so welcome.

3169," So welcome on, you can now get more than just caffeine when you get a red eye or your red eye. Delta and Starbucks are teaming up and their most loyal customers can benefit most. We'll have those details next. you it's time for triple play the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We have Camico, Moderna and Starbucks and my pick is Uranium Minor Camico. Now the ticker is CCJ. The stock off about as you can see they're down about almost 14% there and that's after announcing a deal to buy Westinghouse Electric for $7.9 billion and that's via a partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners. Now to fund the deal, Camico is selling $650 million worth of stock, priced at $21.95 a share and is also expected to close this deal in the second half of 2023. Now Brookfield Renewable and its institutional partners will own 51% of Westinghouse with the remainder going to Camico. Now a significant deal this is as Westinghouse services, services nearly half the nuclear power generation sector and of course the timing coincides with nuclear power really in focus at the moment due to the energy crisis in Europe, also high oil and gas prices and then of course you have some CEOs including Elon Musk who have been pushing for more nuclear energy use. You have Michelle the drop that we're seeing today the largest percentage decrease that we've seen in the stock sense January of 2017. So just putting today's decline into perspective you mentioned the focus here on nuclear energy. It's very similar to what we heard when we had the uranium energy CEO on the show not too long ago. He was talking about the importance of nuclear power here given the current energy climate right now saying that one in five US homes are powered by nuclear energy. He of course is making the case that more of that should be done in our own backyard that we should be investing more. So here in the US for up you can see the demand there for nuclear power and exactly what that looks like here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,79,2022-10-12 19:35:00
3170," of that should be done in our own backyard that we should be investing more. So here in the U.S. for up, you can see the demand there for nuclear power and exactly what that looks like here, given the current energy landscape. All right, my play today is Moderna. It's a top performer in the S&P after Merck extended its partnership with the company to jointly develop and also sell a cancer vaccine to treat patients with melanoma. Now Merck will pay Moderna $250 million for the collaboration, including joint development and future commercialization. Now Wall Street's viewing this as a big one ahead of the clinical trial results that we are expecting before the end of the year. You can see the pop in the stock today. This is not the only catalyst for Moderna. The FDA also granting emergency use authorization for its Omacron booster vaccine for children as young as six years old. So two stories here, very bullish for Moderna here and we're seeing the Pusok pop mostly on the cancer news, but still, big mostly. I was about to say, I think for the most part, the upside of the Omacron or any of the COVID vaccines, it's pretty much worn off. We are pretty much over it and flip the page, but it is that younger portion where there are some people that have not had their kids vaccinated. But this key truda is key because you've heard so many questions, Moderna. What now? What have you done for me lately? You've printed money for two years. What's the next plan? And this is finally a glimpse into that. Keytruda Merck's second biggest drug, 35% of their sales in the most recent quarter. My play is a two for its Delta Airlines and Starbucks. You gotta love coffee when you're flying. What's the comment thread here, though, beyond that? The two are linking their loyalty programs in order to boost sales. Starting today, once you connect the accounts, Delta Sky Miles members can earn one mile for each dollar spent at Starbucks. Members will also earn double stars on Starbucks rewards when making purchases at participating Starbucks on days when flying Delta. I know that sounds confusing. Check your email if you're a member of either. They've already emailed you. Through the end of the year, Sky Miles members can earn 500 miles if they link accounts, earn another 150 and stars once they make a qualifying purchase. This adds to existing Delta rewards relationships already with lift, Airbnb and Instacart. Delta Stock is up. Just over, let's see, it was just over 1%. Now 27% though, your today's Starbucks is up as well, 1% and down, 25% year to date. Interesting partnership, although speaking of coffee loyalty stories, the big story this week, Rochelle has been dunking members are furious at their changes, making it harder to get a freak up a coffee, and they say they're going to Starbucks. I don't believe it. I mean, there's a pretty significant price difference between what you pay at Dunkin' in Starbucks. I don't know how long it will last, but you start looking at your wallet. Exactly. As you were mentioning, these partnerships that Delta has, we saw from Prashant Sharma Vice President of Loyalty at Delta, they've really been trying to evolve the premium experience. They say they want to really capture that, whether you're flying with them or not. So, Sili, clearly having that overlap, that Delta customers get to enjoy that premium experience, so to Starbucks consumers, I like this fusion. I think this is good. What do you think, Sean? Yeah, I don't think there's anything not to like about. I'm a little confused just in terms of how you're going to prove that you're flying on Delta. How exactly this all works? So, I think we're all going to have to check the fine print of this, but this partnership of course makes a lot of sense. And this is coming in terms of, as we approach a potential worsening economic slowdown, consumer facing brands, facing a pretty rocky couple of months, that's what we expect at least. So, a partnership like this certainly does not help. Davey listed the partners that Delta has already had locked in here so far. It makes a lot of sense. I hope a similar partnership is coming to United. I don't fly Delta that often, but I think it makes a lot of sense. And I think flyers of Delta and Starbucks drinkers are going to be very excited about this one. I'm just wondering which of the airlines is going to partner up with the streamer. It's got to happen in the next couple of years. Just going to put that out there. Coming up, Fanatics is preparing to place a massive wager on sports betting in 2023.

3172," What do we know? So they had cut their production forecast twice this year from around $20,000 to $12,000, $14,000 to now at $6,000 to $7,000 a year. They're reaffirming that $6,000, $7,000 target. They actually made around 2,300 cards last quarter, which is triple the amount they made in Q2. But that's not that much. So a lot of heads are rolling actually in management there. CEO Peter also went to the factory with their everyday to sort of like, iron out those issues so that they're finally past that with the production kind of bottlenecks. But still a long way to go. We're talking about a car that costs around $150,000. So volume is low to begin with. But they have said they want to make an $80,000 base level to lose it air. So maybe that comes soon. Also the gravity SUVs also on the horizon. So that's another probably big deal for them. Hopefully next year we'll see that. It's a nice, very affordable $80,000 version.

It looks like demand is very strong amongst the airlines. What's your assessment? Yeah, thanks for having me. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, you're right, demand. Especially for international is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international and mostly international leisure. And I think that's somewhat behind the United Decision to add more leisure international destinations for next summer. We did a preview on Friday for the earnings season. And we said we thought American Delta United had the best opportunity for positive surprise because we've gone from the first, say, four months of the year when we saw international down something around 60%, 50% to 60% from 2019 levels. And now we're down closer to 15%, 1%, 5%. So you've seen that big increases as markets have opened up. People have shifted and started flying further, especially Transatlantic, not so much Trans-Pacific, but Transatlantic. And business we've gone from being down about 40% or 50% earlier in the year to being down 25% earlier in the year. So I think those two elements, and we've still seen strong domestic leisure, but instead of being up 35%, it's up closer to 10%, 15%. So you've seen that mix shift, which has huge positive implications for revenue. And I think the Delta reports tomorrow first, you just mentioned that. And I think you'll hear them talk about that for the rest of the quarter, or the rest of the current quarter. Yeah, fourth quarter. And I know, obviously, the industry is still dealing with some of these staffing shortages as well. How is this affecting some of the more profitable routes for these airlines? I'm sorry. I missed the first half. They're doing more of these what as well. As we're still seeing some issues when it comes to things like labor shortages, as we continue to see some of these kinks getting worked out, how is this affecting some of the most profitable routes? Yeah. So we're having these issues to your point, with respect to infrastructure. So it's not just labor. It's air traffic control. It's airport infrastructure. I don't know when you flew last, but I was at an airport. So it was two airports yesterday and the day before and stores are closed. They haven't reopened. They can't find people. And we're seeing a lot of that. And so that's going to inform growth for 2023 and probably 2024. And not only that, you didn't specifically ask about this, but the OEMs are behind on deliveries. So the airlines don't have the, and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,82,2022-10-12 19:48:54
3173," The OEMs are behind on deliveries, so the airlines don't have the, and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective, it's really hard for network planning to think about where they're going to grow and where these aircraft are going to go and not knowing whether you're even going to have the aircraft. United is in a really unique position because they didn't retire a lot. They don't retire any, as a matter of fact, of their wide-body aircraft during the pandemic. So they are in a really great position to be able to shift capacity around their network and grow into some of these domestic leisure markets. That's part of why we have United rated and outperform. And the others retire their aircraft and in part they were older, so it made sense to retire them, but they're having issues because the OEMs are behind on deliveries or having issues getting. They're having our aircraft to be able to grow, growing, going forward. So we think we'll probably talk a lot about that too. Yeah, Holly, you mentioned the supply chain issues, the volatile jet fuel prices, difficulty hiring and retaining employees. A lot of this focus is going to be on how exactly these airlines are going to reign in costs at this time. What do you want to hear? What do you expect to hear over the coming weeks? Yeah, so the first thing I'd love to hear from them is labor contracts. Every, the big four airlines have open pilot contracts. American has an open flight to tenant contract. I would love to hear them talk about there. They probably won't because they don't like to talk about open labor contracts on earnings calls, but I would love it if they could give us some confidence that maybe by next summer, a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great, both from an investor perspective and from an employee perspective. I think it would be nice. And if the pilots, the flight attendants knew what they were going to be earning, and I think that would be good to get that resolved. We also, as you mentioned earlier, we need to attract people to the profession. I mean, we can't just do it overnight. We need to start with young people, younger people. But yes, I'd love to hear that. I think we're going to hear a lot of discussion about their loyalty programs. The number one credit card that everybody has that Americans mostly have, anyway, is a cashback card. And then that's usually followed by a gas card. But if you live in a hub city, you probably have an airline card and your spend is probably high. And you, but it takes a while to earn, earn a free ticket or an upgrade. So the airline's like having that dollar today, because it's not going to be redeemed for months yet. And it definitely helps. But if there's the shift in mix to more leisure oriented travel from business and corporate travel, that's going to inform the way the airlines think about loyalty going forward. So I'd love to hear them talk a little bit about that. I'm demanding for the holiday season. I'm starting to hear from people that fairs are getting a little out of control. And so they're driving versus flying. I feel like everybody goes home for Christmas, but not everybody goes home for Thanksgiving. And in my investor calls lately, I've been hearing people echoing that and saying, we're driving this year for Thanksgiving or we're doing Thanksgiving at our house this year. We're not going. We have to buy four tickets, five tickets, whatever. It's just gone like really aggressive. Especially given how far fairs have come in the last say 18 months, because obviously in the worst part of the pandemic, the airlines were discounting. And in the last six or nine months, they've been raising fairs pretty aggressively in part to cover higher costs. But in part to discourage some demand. But yeah, flights are full. They're like 90 percent. Well, they're more there. They're almost always going out with very few free-seats available seats. Well, certainly airlines and flyers as well, having to be more strategic at the moment. A big thank you to Helene Becker for joining us this afternoon. Thank you. All right, well, fanatics is looking to disrupt the sports betting space and soon. These are all the company's plans.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,83,2022-10-12 19:52:56
3174," Becca for joining us this afternoon. Thank you. All right, well, fanatics, there's looking to disrupt the sports betting space and soon. These are all on the company's plans next. Sports apparel retail giant fanatics is not satisfied with the $27 billion valuation. The company is betting big on the sports gambling space. They're CEO Michael Rubin saying that the sports business journal world congress of sports that fanatics will be in 15 to 20 states by the start of the 2023 NFL season. Listen. We want to have an integrated gambling experience where someone can have one, you know, kind of, you know, locked into our experience once. They have one loyalty program across all of our businesses. You buy merchandise, you're incentive to game. You gamble, you're incentive to get a collectible, you know, an integrated experience. So we will be, I'll tell you this right now, we will be in every major market other than New York by next football season, you know, 15 to 20 states. That's Rubin with executive editor of sports business journal A Madcore and look, they're not in New York for two reasons. One is they got denied the permit there, but also a 51% tax on sports gambling revenue. Can you make money in the state of New York? Not entirely clear. I can't tell if they can be successful in this field because Draft Kings and Fandool have just been dominant and they're not making money. So Michael says to anyone that says to him, Hey, it's too late to get in this game. He says, how are these companies doing from a year ago? Well, Draft Kings is down. Let's see, 72% in the last 12 months. Flutter, which owns Fandool down 30%. Pen gaming is down 60% in the last 12 months.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,84,2022-10-12 19:56:59
3175," and let's see, 72% in the last 12 months. Flutter, which owns Fandall, down 30%, Penn Gaming is down 60% in the last 12 months. So yes, it is late, but in this game, it's still very early, second or third inning, and the bottom line is he's one of those leaders. Mike Rubin, it's just so damn smart, I can't bet against him. Yeah, exactly, you came bet against him. They do have an advantage when it comes to the data on their customers, that of course will give them maybe the leg up against some of those bigger competitors that you just mentioned. It's going to be very, very expensive. The customer acquisition costs a number of estimates out there, but what they're going to have to spend in order to build up this business, that is going to cost a lot. Interesting that they do want to venture into this side of the sports industry. And then of course, Rochelle, the impact that this could potentially have on some of those publicly traded companies. When we talk about draft kings performing so poorly over the past year, Fandall also having a rough time over the last 12 months, if in fact, Michael Rubin is successful with this, that will also push out some of those profitability targets that we've heard from some of these bigger companies. I mean, speaking of profitability, he also talked about licensing, because he was saying, you know, perhaps people think licensing is an issue when it comes to expanding, but he was saying that prices are actually 30% to 40% cheaper than a year ago. So he was saying that his patients actually paid off. A lot of people who didn't have, who had the money to spend overpaid, and now he's like, well, we're in a good position. So clearly being strategic about this. So perhaps that could be where the profits of Bentley's going to come from, perhaps the profit that will end up making from all the licensing. Goes back to what Dave said. It's questionable, I think, but you don't want to get bet against Rubin. Take Michael's name out of it, I'd say no chance. Yeah. But I'm saying there's a chance. All right, well, we've got to take a break here. Coming up on the other side, we're counting down to the closing bill on Wall Street. You're still looking at mixed picture, S&P in the red, off just about 2% to the percent. We'll be right back. All right. All right. Yeah. Just about 90 seconds here until the closing bell. Gender Blueprint joining us in studio with a closer look if some of these movers, hey, Jared? Hey there. So, not a lot of big movement in the major indices. We didn't get any fireworks from the Fed minutes, from the prior meeting, and then we're expected. However, we are looking toward tomorrow's CPI report. We are expecting a moderation in the headline number, but an increase in the core number. And I think that's why we're seeing some muted action here. Do you have a new trajectories?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,85,2022-10-12 20:03:09
3176," We are looking toward tomorrow's CPI report. We are expecting a moderation in the headline number, but an increase in the core number. And I think that's why we're seeing some muted action here. There's not in utilities and the other interest rates sector of real estate. We're going to get to the bond market in a second, but just want to note, energy staples and discretionary, those are in the green. And let's take a look at some charts now with about a minute, less than a minute to go. This is a 13 week T bill yield. This is very short duration. This tracks what the Fed is thinking, or what is anticipated to be done. It is up 19 basis points. A huge move today. So a relentless increase in the expect exosfire works tomorrow morning. Before we go here, I think we have time for one more heat map. And we do have that in terms of the travel section. Check out this. Royal City enough 11% today. He's a closing bell on Balsby. There is your closing bell on this huff day stocks ending the day on a downward note. Not a whole lot of action as you can see. The doubt down to 28 points. The S&P doubt about 12 in the NASDAQ barely slipping to the downside. Nine points. Not a whole lot of reaction to the Fed minutes. We're close to looking for broader markets. Let's bring in Eric Friedman, U.S. Bank asset management CIO and Hugh Roberts, quant insight head of analytics. Good to see you both. Eric, let's start with you. Any takeaway from the Fed minutes? Are you expect tighter, longer? Nothing's really changed in the dynamics here. I think it's a story that we've heard from the Fed most specifically post Jackson Hall, which is rates higher and higher for longer. I think that was really the key message coming out of this set of minutes. I think the key thing for us as we think about the really the talent of this year is not so much what happens next meeting. But what does it look like for the Fed in the first quarter of next year? By that point, we expect to have a little bit of guidance from companies, which should be a little more sobered and perhaps a bit more tepid than what we may hear right now. So our viewpoint is the bar is pretty high for the Fed to come off. It's correct rate path for this year. But if we get into the first quarter of next year with some downbeat company guidance, the Fed may start to waver at least a little bit. And Hugh, as you look at the Fed minutes, and also some of these data points that you know that the Fed is watching and really looking for this sustained inflation to start going down. What is your outlook? Yeah, I would largely echo Eric's comment first up. I think this year and the immediate next couple of meetings are pretty much locked in really 2023 and the outlook there is more important. I guess if we're trying to look a wee bit further ahead, I think the comments from Deputy Chair Brainard have been probably the most interesting because the messaging has been consistent. It's been about taking financial conditions. That's been true all year and as Eric said, it went up a gear after Jackson Hole. Brainard appears to be the one who is just flagging the fact that overseas market is seeing stress. We've seen obviously intervention in Dolly-N. We're all aware that Shenanigans going on here in the UK after the many budget a few weeks back. I know the whole kind of move fast and break things. I think in the States you're used to looking at things like inverted yield curves or credit spreads or things that might domestically be the things that break. But actually it's looking like it's international stuff that's breaking first and Brainard seems to be flagging that up a little bit. So very early days yet, it's not obvious she's got a consensus at all but she's the one potential outlier as things currently stand. Eric, what do you think this measure is in terms of the pricing activity that we're going to see between now and year end? Are we going to remain volatile or is more of that risk to the downside do you think from these levels? We think probably a little more risk to the downside. I would just tip my cap to Q and they're firm. They do great work on this topic specifically but just in terms of our read on things. We say really a couple things at work. Number one is that we think we're largely in sync with the feds most recent thoughts regarding the forward state of the curve. In other words, the market is really in tune with what the fed is thinking with respect to interest rate hikes. That's really the first repricing that we've had. You cover this as a team very well in the last.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,86,2022-10-12 20:06:23
3177," In other words, the market is really in tune with what the Fed is thinking with respect to interest rate hikes. That's really the first repricing that we've had. You cover this as a team very well in the last segment. And we think what's next is the slowdown, almost the lagged impact of higher rates still elevated fuel costs, still elevated shelter costs. We think that's going to start to really weigh in on margins. And so we do think there's probably a little more downside. We wouldn't be abandoning ships, if you will, right now. But we do think that in terms of risk to the equity market, we'd still be leading a bit more defensive. As you pointed out, utilities and infrastructure, those have been areas that we've actually been, been really constructive on. They've been, we think on, on duly hits in recent days, those are getting more attractive. We stick around in energy as well. Those would be our top ideas right now. Here, you say the latest down move has not been a function of macro fundamentals. What are you seeing? Well, it's more of the fact that we're being uber tactical here to be fair. So, you know, the primary trend throughout 2022 has been at macro conditions for us equity markets have got worse. And that's largely a function of what we talked about just now, i.e. tighter financial conditions. And in particular, they're moving real yields and the move and credit spreads. What's interesting from a very short term perspective is that this latest down trade, and I'm talking in the last week now, our model value was actually flatlined. So that this very latest down move has been less justified by macro fundamentals than from much of the bear market price action of the last nine, 10 months. So if you are in a kind of repeat of the summer potential for a bear market squeeze, looking at positioning, looking at beaten up sentiment, I saw an interesting tweet today about inside of buying picking up tends to get people interested when, you know, CEOs are buying their own stocks. If you're thinking there's scope for a bit of a tactical squeeze within the context of the primary bear market, then what we're seeing at the moment actually is that S&P is around 6% cheap to our model value because macro conditions have kind of stabilized up at the lows. And this latest selloff has gone a little bit further. So still agree with the primary bearish dynamic that there's been a spouse, but there may be some hope for a little bit of a bear market squeeze. And Eric, there's some of the clients that you speak to. What lens are you suggesting that they really view this period through? Yeah, it's a great question. I think that, you know, for those that have capital that they need in the what's called the next three to six months, we think that like a great place to be is in very short duration of income. Well, for a long time, we just haven't been paid or shell to be involved in whatsoever in that part of the curve. Not to say that there isn't some potential price risk, but just as you hit on the earlier segment, if you're looking at corporate bonds and are spitting out 5, 5, 5, 6% yields, not a bad spot to be in very, very short maturities. I do think that for those clients that have the ability to kind of piece into stuff, we would not be aggressively involved in technology, we're just going to scratch right now. We do think that the supply, demand and balance is still skewed the wrong way for technology in the media term. But again, we do think that there's likely to be some rationalization towards the middle to the second half of next year for again, for longer term investors. So our viewpoint has been, look, take what you're given and this market, don't trade the market that you want to trade the market that you have. And so grabbing some yield up front makes sense. We do think that there's a time to again reconcile the second half of next year. We're just not there quite yet. And you, one of the challenges in this market now is a strong dollar. That of course is being felt on a global scale. We did get the earnings out from Pepsi this morning that were actually better than expected. And so we're wondering whether or not I guess how big of a threat that strong dollar would be to a name like Pepsi. What do you think today's results really tell us just about what we couldn't expect this earnings season? Well, from a macro perspective, I think the Pepsi earnings were bad news from the Fed's policymaking perspective, because it basically showed that they have pricing power and they're going to increase margins. And that's not good for the Fed who want to see demand slow down, obviously. More broadly, I agree totally that the strength of the dollar is going to be a key key issue for this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,87,2022-10-12 20:10:40
3178," on a Z demand slowdown, obviously. More broadly, I agree totally that the strength of the dollar is going to be a key key issue for this particular earnings season. On our analysis, we have the ability to break down patterns between, say, sectors and the strength of the dollar. And it's the independent pattern where we can out but we're able to strip out the isolated impact of the dollar on different assets. And what stands out on our analysis at the moment is that if you look at the likes of energy by the XLE, OIH, XOP, they're all comparatively indifferent to the dollar. It's not really a big driver of price action in the energy ETS at the moment. But it's technology that is most vulnerable. And that's true for XLK. It is true for something like consumer discretionary, where, of course, Amazon and Tesla are, I think, nearly 50% of that sector. And it's especially true for something like Sox, the semi-conduct, that ETF. So I think that's probably where, on our analysis, that's where potentially the most pain is going to be felt. Lots of great insights. They would do appreciate you both joining us, Eric Friedman and Hugh Roberts with your market insights. While investors watching tomorrow's inflation data closely and the data will have a big impact on millions of social security recipients, inflation from the third quarter is used to determine the cost of living adjustment or cola. Now, the adjustment for 2023 is likely to be 8.7% according to estimates from the senior citizens league. Now, that means the average monthly social security check would rise by $145. And that is the biggest jump since 1981. All right, well, coming up, the Amazon Labor Union faces its next test in upstate New York. We'll give you the latest when we come back.

3179," Apple is reportedly withholding its latest employee perks from a unionized store in Maryland. Apple, according to Bloomberg, has told retail and corporate employees that going to increase education and in some states' health benefits. However, employees at the one unionized Apple store in a Baltimore suburb will have to negotiate for those benefits via their collective bargaining arrangement. Now the news comes as employees at an Oklahoma City store are said to vote this week on joining a union. Apple shares closing down about half a percent in today's trade. Sure, no? Well, Apple rival Amazon, also dealing with unionization efforts starting today, workers at a warehouse near Albany, New York can vote in a pivotal union election. Yahoo, finance, senior tech reporter, Ali Garfinkle, joins us now with more. Hey, Ali. Hi, Shana, great to be here. So it's important to remember here this vote is pivotal. A victory for the Amazon labor union could be watershed. It could prove that they can really generate some momentum in more than one warehouse. And nurses are telling me that the ALU actually thinks they have a pretty decent shot here. The organizing has been organic and it's actually a relatively small number for the ALU. About 400 workers they're trying to organize, which is to be fair still a lot by NLRB standards. I'm looking for the Albany vote count to start on October 18th. Ali, big picture here. We hear a lot about the unionization effort across the country, but where are we overall? Overall Dave, I was talking to San Francisco State professor John Logan about this recently. And what he said is that in part this is actually a byproduct of the pandemic. You include down to the fact a lot of these unions were seeing, including the Amazon labor union, Trader Joe's union, that they're unconventional unions. The discontent that was kind of fermented by the pandemic has really facilitated and really helped unions gain momentum that they haven't necessarily had in decades. In the case of Amazon, we did see a petition for a vote in the inland empire near Los Angeles recently. And it's important to say though, nothing is all said and done. The odds are usually still in the employer's favor. And in the case of this vote that's coming in California potentially, the NLRB has not yet authorized that election. However, it's important to state that location here is important, particularly in the inland empire. I've talked to experts who've called it logistics central. So a vote there would really matter not only for warehouses, but for Amazon in particular. The company has actually invested more than 19 billion in the inland empire since about 2010. So, the messaging I'm getting out of Amazon as of today so far is that they are skeptical that that vote will come to fruition, but the either way, I'm looking for them to continue to fight. And overall, yeah, they have a lot of momentum, but would it be stopped cold in its tracks if we enter a recessionary environment? That. We shall wait and see. Ali Garfinkle, thanks so much. Appreciate that. Coming up, a Bank of America survey reveals significant differences between how millennials and older generations are investing. We'll break it down next. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,89,2022-10-12 20:19:15
3180," son The Well-being millennials are losing faith in the stock market as a way to build wealth. A recent Bank of America survey found that many are turning to alternative investments to find those returns. Here with more on that is Jeff Busconi, Bank of America Head of Private Bank Services. Jeff, welcome back to the show. So talk about the divergence in what we're seeing between some younger investors and older millennials. Sure, and thank you thanks for having me. It's great to be here with you again. Yes, so we did find in our survey some generational differences emerging. And in particular 75% of younger investors who were part of our survey indicated that they don't believe a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds will generate above average returns over time and into the future. So that was really one of the major findings. We also found that younger investors were more inclined to have sustainable investment products in their portfolios and also wanting to have an impact through philanthropy with their wealth. Jeff, you mentioned the fact that this group of individuals is favoring alternative investment or really finding a reason to invest there. I guess what do you think is driving that lack of confidence when it comes to stocks and bonds? I think I would point to a couple of factors. First, you have to remember where we're coming from from a market standpoint. We've come through a fairly prolonged period of strong performance at the equity and bond markets. And of course, this year we've had considerably more volatility. So that may be causing some investors to think about investments outside of traditional investments. I also think the alternative investment universe continues to evolve. There's more and more access to alternative investments through platforms like ours here at Bank of America. And as access grows, interest may also be increasing. Remember this was historically the domain of institutions and endowments. The last thing I would point to is remember that this generation has really come of age during a period of extreme innovation. And so there may be a greater willingness here in this generation to embrace newer asset classes and different products. They're also coming of age at a time where crypto and NFTs have absolutely crashed in particular NFTs. Has that shied them forced in the shy away from some of those digital assets? You know, what we see around digital and this was picked up in the survey as well, there's a lot of innovation and development happening in that space. One will tell how it all plays out. If in our client base, our conversations are focused mostly on education.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,90,2022-10-12 20:23:50
3181," in that space. Time will tell how it all plays out. Within our client base, our conversations are focused mostly on education. People want to learn more about the ecosystem. They want to understand what it is, how it works. And Jeff, I thought it was interesting as we had that crypto question in this study, looking at the discrepancy between those who thought they understood crypto well and whether they thought it would actually pay off as a longer term investment, break down some of that for us. Sure, again, I think what you're starting to see in the survey again is generational differences among investors. And as I just said, you know, the younger investors, college, 20 to 40, they've come of age in a period of just extreme innovation. So they may be willing to embrace newer asset classes, non-conventional forms of investment to a degree that maybe we haven't seen in prior generations. Again, I think time will tell when it comes to crypto. And certainly the current market environment is playing into the mindset here around crypto. Jeff, one thing that did stick out to me in this survey was that only half of wealthy parents considered their children well prepared to inherit their fortunes. The conversations that you've had with clients just the feeling out there, why do you think that is? Look, so I think you put your finger on one of the critical insights from the survey. We're all aware of the 84 trillion in wealth that's set to transfer here over the next two decades. And yet half just half of parents feel that their children are well prepared to inherit that wealth. For us, I think that speaks to a need, a continued need around a state planning, wealth in a state planning. Our advisors, our client teams need to really be having comprehensive holistic dialogues with families around a state planning. And it's not just the documents, the legal documents, its conversations around family dynamics, purpose, impact, all of the factors that go into having a really well thought out a state plan. And finally, we talk a lot about ESG investing in this space and it's been a hot topic across the country politically as well. Statistically, what is the survey showing about the drop-off between younger people and those over 43? So what the survey showed is about a quarter of all respondents have ESG and their portfolios. That 25% or so is driven heavily by this younger cohort of investors. Upwards of 70% of the younger investors have ESG and their portfolios. So there again, you see a divergence between the older generation of investors and the younger generation of investors. I think it's important to point out that there was a quarter of respondents had exposure and that's double the level that it was just four years ago in 2018. So this is an area that's growing rapidly and that's an area of focus particularly for younger investors who feel that this is just a smart way to invest. It's not a specific initiative or something separate. It's yet another way to have a positive impact on the world around them. It's growing rapidly as is the pushback to ESG investing as well, right? Thank you. Jeff was going to do good stuff. Appreciate that. Continuing the conversation about young investors now, Goldman Sachs taking a survey of its 2400 interns to get their perspective on the world today and some fascinating takeaways including how they invest, which unsurprisingly lines up with the wealthy Millennial survey, 28% invest in stocks, 15% of ETFs and 12% in cryptos. You might ask, why do we care what Goldman Sachs interns think? This is an extraordinary cross section of young America, Taipei, highly successful young people, 68 languages spoken among these 2400 interns. They're not your average run of the Mill interns as all I'm trying to point out here, but some interesting takeaways. What struck you? You know, what struck me was some of their priorities when looking for a job. You mentioned the fact that a lot of them are Taipei. Obviously, very, very driven group of individuals, 34% saying that they're putting a huge emphasis on what they do day to day, 21% say who their colleagues will be only 20%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,91,2022-10-12 20:27:38
3182," A very, very, very driven group of individuals, 34% saying that they're putting a huge emphasis on what they do day to day, 21% say who their colleagues will be. Only 12% though putting companies' purpose. And the reason I bring this up is because when we talk about Gen Z, when we talk about this generation, other results have shown this real focus on a company's purpose, how that is among the top priorities here for somebody who is seeking a job. So that not necessarily reflected in this survey, at least when you take a look at majority, also only 8% focusing on advancement. I thought that that would have been a little bit higher as well. And then also just plans to retire. And I like this because they're very optimistic, 35%, saying that they want to retire between the ages of 55 and 65. On the other hand, 29% nearly a third want to work as long as possible. I also want to redo this survey in 10 years. And on the find out, those 29% of people would still say that they want to work as long as possible. I think they will. Yeah, I don't know. Check in on that every decade. I think for every decade you work, that enthusiasm is probably going to tap for doubt. I thought it was interesting. Obviously, it's a very day to driven business that they're in. When it came to where they turned to find their truth when they came to getting information, 40% turned to friends and family, 35% turned to digital news outlets. So really this shift is where people are getting their information from. They consider clearly friends and family the more trusted source that they tend to go to. And then social media came in at about 14%. So I know, obviously, Twitter has this, it seems like this has this massive outreach but in terms of where people sort of get their final information from and the sources that they trust, I thought that was interesting. And I know we talk a lot about the return to work. And 99% of them said that they believe that relationships are best formed in person. Because there is something that gets lost if you don't get to have that. At least at least some sort of face-to-face interaction. So you really get a sense of people. A lot can get lost in translation over text or video chat. I was happy to hear that. You mentioned Twitter. TikTok was a surprise. Only 1% of these interns post on that. They all said really overwhelmingly Instagram is their platform, both posting and following. How do they pay for stuff? 47% use an app. Only 2% cash. A lot of fascinating takeaways. They prefer shopping in person over all of the time. I was surprising to me. I would have thought the online app would have been much much. Yeah, 2% cash is not king for the kids. Maybe in the markets right now. Not for the young people. App on their phone. You know, I'm slowly using Apple Pay more and more. When she start, it is life changing. I'll say that. All right, well, come here. Next, Microsoft revealing a slew of new products today. We'll tell you all about them next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,92,2022-10-12 20:32:30
3183,"e Apple and Google are among the major names in tech unveiling their newest products in recent weeks, and now it's Microsoft's turn. The company unveiled a slew of new Surface products earlier today. You said, Medi, Microsoft corporate vice president joins us, along with Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley to break it all down. So thank you for joining us. I want to first get your instincts here. We have a very crowded market. What were the standout products for Microsoft so far? Today there's really a couple of big things. One is the next major update to Windows 11, which really makes a lot of improvements in accessibility, insecurity, and productivity for people as well as better gaming. And then a number of updates with our new devices on our Surface line. So we have a new Surface laptop 5 and a Surface Pro 9, both of which are 50% faster than the predecessors. They're amazing for hybrid work and learning. And the Pro 9 has new capabilities that let you take advantage of the cloud and AI to do some incredible creativity that you haven't been able to do before. You said this is Dan. I just want to get a sense of who you think the customers are for these types of devices, really. You have the hybrid Pro 9, you have the laptop, you have the studio, and you have some adaptive technology there. Who's really the audience here? Yeah, good question, Dan. It's a pretty broad audience. So if we start with the two most mainstream products we have. We have the Surface Pro 9, which is our 2-in-1. It's our tablet that can replace a laptop. It's designed for the mobile professional that likes to move around or the person who's running from the house, running the home and moving around. It's a laptop and a keyboard. It's a great device. We also have then the laptop 5, which is essentially similar class, but more of a laptop form factor. Again, great for businesses, business professionals, but also great for students and great for people in the home. Those are our mainstream devices. They start at $9.99 and they go up from there. Then we have a very high end, probably our best creativity device. It's the Surface Studio 2 Plus. It's designed for creators, professionals, programmers, designers, graphic designers in enterprise. That's a more expensive device, obviously, but it is the absolute best creation device. Finally, as you mentioned, we do some number of great accessories for people with disabilities. One in five people in the US deal with some form of disability and these devices let you use your Surface devices in a much easier form. I guess where are you seeing most people use their computers now? We're in the hybrid work world at this point. It seems like it's staying that way. Where are they really sticking to? That games chat, what is it? Sorry, what was the last part you said, Dan? It games chat or work. How are they using this? They're using it for quite a variety of things. For people at work, they're using their laptops for obviously remote work. They're doing video conference calling. We've seen 300 million more apps use like Discord, Slack, Teams, ReChadternet is now used in a very less way from home. Also, of course, for a creation with Microsoft 365 and productivity devices. Then a lot of gaming. A lot of gaming gets done on it. Gaming's still at an all time high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,93,2022-10-12 20:36:35
3184," Also, of course, for a creation with Microsoft 365 and productivity devices. And then a lot of gaming, a lot of gaming gets done on it. Gaming's still at an all time high. So we see a lot of that in home use. We see people doing things like telehealth. They're doing online shopping from home. They're doing communications and connecting with family and friends. So they're doing a variety of tasks. As a whole, what we've seen over the last two years, use of Windows PCs and Windows 11 is up significantly. It's up 10% total minutes per device. We see 20% more people using Windows PCs in the past. And that's because the relevancy of the PC in our lives has probably never been greater. And use of the, we are seeing a slow down overall than what we're seeing with PC demand. How is Microsoft navigating this space? And what does the next generation of the PC look like? Yeah, it's a great question. You're right. We're in a tough macro environment. So it's very hard these days, whether it's interest rates up or the war in Europe and the like, a big part of what's good about the PC is it is really the best value for your money if you're buying an electronics device. And a big part of that is, as I was just talking about, usage is up, that's the proof in there. Where we see things going is we see continued new use cases opening up on the PC. Like I mentioned, they're being used now in a way that they weren't before for video conferencing because of the remote work. We're seeing, like I said, online shopping quite a bit. I saw recently that you were just talking a little bit about how new generation likes to shop in person, but broadly people want to shop at home. And we've seen a huge amount of that. We offer a coupon feature in Edge now. We've saved over $1.4 billion for people with coupons. The average person can save $100 when shopping online using Microsoft Edge browser. So I think we're going to see some of these new use cases open up for shopping, for health, for gaming, for creation. And I think that will continue. All right, well, a big thank you for joining us this afternoon, you, Seth Medi, and our very own Dan Howley. Thank you both. All right, coming up, Major League Baseball hopes it's deal with CBD maker Charlotte's Web becomes a home run. Charlotte's Web CEO tells us how the deal came together next. I'll speak about unlocked events this evening at the UK experience it's all set, one of the biggest benefits is the low common chain data. We ended two game games with Zная.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,95,2022-10-12 20:44:15
3185," To do this, can we grind the butter and sugar into egg whites? Let's slow heat it up. Then webpage Take me out to the cannabis game Major League Baseball, the first of the four major US sports leagues to sign a sponsorship deal with the CBD company. Technically a cannabis compound, Charlottes Web today becomes MLB's official CBD company. Jack Torturellis is the CEO of Charlottes Web and joins us now good to see you. Want to talk about how this deal came together and what it means for the industry. If you could just dispel a little bit of the misconception out there about what exactly is CBD and what's its application for athletes? Yeah, so sure great thanks for having me on you know simply put MLB and CW Charlottes Web are changing the future of wellness for athletes and fans together. You know MLB's decision reflects what players and fans really want today by bringing botanical wellness options to support the everyday lives of athletes and fans particularly around mental wellness. You know things in each states like staying calm under pressure recovery after exercise, maintaining the focus when it counts and sleeping like a champ. You know these are players that are on the road 162 games in a season seven months a year and we really believe that they have, they believe quite strongly that having the mental balance, the balance between the mental health and the physical health is super important and that's why they chose to open up the category and do it with Charlottes Web which is you know the industry founder of CBD and the leading company in CBD and purely because we have and we're uniquely qualified to be able to do this with the science and the credibility we have including the NSF certification that we got for our sports line and NSF as you know is the goal standard for sort of quality in CBD and botanicals. The sponsorship deal it's clearly huge for your company it's huge for your industry what do you think this does just in terms of the conversation that will likely have around CBD and the adoption that we could see as a result of it? Yeah I think it's a game changer for us and particularly given you know 180 million fans all of their social platforms that we now have access to is a microphone and the microphone is going to be really used for education telling telling consumers telling athletes telling trainers you know what CBD is and what it isn't it's not marijuana it's hemp and I think that's an important part of what they want to get across and we want to get across and we think it's huge for the industry and most importantly huge for Charlottes Web which again you know is uniquely qualified from the science and credentials point of view to be able to have this partnership come to life and I also want to point out that Charlottes Web has five of seven hemp patents and again the credentials are unquestionable which is why NSF certified our products to support. Doc mentioned it's the first of the four major US sports to have a CBD deal. How much resistance was there to a sponsorship deal like this and do you think the other leagues will follow? I don't think there was a resistance at all I think and the MLB was really a first mover a thought leader in this space very aligned in terms of wellness for players botanical wellness and again helping the mind not just the body and so you know the deal came together with two like-minded organizations wanting to do you know wellness solution for their players and it was just a great process and a real partnership it's not what I would call a traditional you know sort of sponsorship deal but it truly is a partner a partnership and as you may know that there are MLB is now a shareholder in Charlottes Web as a result of this this strategic partnership. You know that's interesting there why would you say it's not typically why you wouldn't describe it as a traditional sponsorship type deal. Yeah because it's not a it's not a pay to play right I mean the two parties now with MLB",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,96,2022-10-12 20:47:15
3186," Typically, why you wouldn't describe it as a traditional sponsorship type deal? Yeah, because it's not a it's not a pay to play, right? I mean, the two parties now with MLB being a shareholder in Charlotte's web, our interests are aligned to grow value through wellness and through our products that offer those solutions for need states, the consumers and players and their fans, ultimately have. So both parties are aligned in a mission of wellness. Both parties are aligned in terms of quality and safety for athletes, first and foremost. And it was really coming together with two like-minded organizations. I wanted to see this coming live. So what's the plan, Jacques, to pursue teams, specific players? And beyond that, the other leagues, the NBA, the NHL and the NFL? Yeah, look, I think all the leagues will ultimately get there. And again, congratulations to Major League Baseball for being at the forefront and being the first mover. I think right now, look, it's day one of our partnership and what we're really focused on is amazingly sort of execution excellence to show the value that our products bring to fans and consumers, to show we can do for players. And ultimately, that's what we're focused on right now. In terms of influences and teams, I strongly believe that influences use of products and are real advocates that they're authentic and not just paid spokesperson. And so if we do anything like that, it'll be with someone who's credible, authentic, and uses of products. Do you know specific players that use the products? I really don't want to talk about that, but I do know, you know, I do know players that have, yeah, and that have been public about it. I wanted to give you a minute to just tell people that don't know the story of Charlotte's Web. It's not about the nursery rhyme. This is Charlotte as one of the more influential people in this industry in terms of how changed medical marijuana laws some feel across the country if you could give us a bit of that backstory. Yeah, no, it's great. You know, Charlotte Figgie was, you know, the first sort of person that came into contact with the brands and the brothers. The company was founded by the seven Stanley brothers. All still shareholders, all still engaged in the company when direction or another. And it was about having a little girl who had 300 seizures, you know, a week and finding a hemp based solution for her. Our original formula, which is still the same formula we have today, you know, some 10 years later, really gave her her life back and her family's life back. And so, you know, at one point, there was a 15,000 patient waiting list for our products and the brothers gave product away because they believe so strongly in helping, you know, from a wellness point of view and providing quality of life for people with our products. And on the back of that story, we created an industry. You know, this is, this was the first company in CBD. It's the market leader in CBD. It's the only company that has seed to shelf sort of quality standards and vertical integration. And so we're very proud of the origins. We're very proud of the family and we're delighted to be able to bring this moment to them and our shareholder is more, more, more generally. Congrats, Nadeel. Interesting to see where it heads from here. CEO of Charlotte's Web, Jacques Tortoroli. Thanks so much. Appreciate that. All right, over to Sean. And now we look at what's moving after hours. All right, Dave, let's take a look at some of these trending ticketers. We have applied materials, a duck creek, a victorious secret. We also have digital world acquisition core of news breaking here just a second. And go, let's kick it off with applied materials. The stock moving to the downside here off just about 1.5% news from the company saying that they are cutting their fourth quarter adjusted EPS forecast, missing the streets estimate. A lot of this has to do with the new export regulations that we got from the Abbot in administration last week. Take a look at that five day chart. You can see the drop shortly after those regulations were announced the stock off nearly 15% in the past five days. It's been a tough go at it for the stock since the start of the year, year to date, off just about 51%. Let's take a look at duck creek here, the soft wear play moving to the upside up just around 6.5% here. The company raising its 2023 revenue guidance that beat the streets estimates now expecting 320 million to 336 million. The estimate out there was for 325 million for the fourth quarter results beating on both the top and bottom lines here, the fourth quarter adjusted EPS.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,96,2022-10-12 20:49:57
3187," $336 million. The estimate out there was for $325 million for the fourth quarter results, beating on both the top and bottom lines here. A fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in at $3 cents. Revenue at $80.7 million. The estimate out there was for $73.2 million. Let's take a look at Victoria Seeger. Remember this company is starting to trade as a standalone company just over a year ago. You can see the stock moving to the upside here. Up just around 4% the move higher coming ahead of its investor day tomorrow. Now the company releasing its strategic growth plan ahead of that investor day. They will focus on three areas. Strength in core, ignite growth, transform the foundation. A lot of it has to do with growth adding brands, especially what they're seeing on an international level. They also updated their guidance here. They see third quarter operating income to come in at the top end of the range here today. Though you can see it's been a rough go for Victoria Seeger. It's been around 41%. I also want to take a look at digital world acquisition here, especially in after hours and move to the upside. You can see it up just around 8.7% news here that Google is adding true social to its play store. Now the news here coming to Google saying that it is approved a true social for distribution on its play store. The Google spokesperson telling Bloomberg that true social can distribute the app on Google Play as long as it complies with its developer guidelines. So again, the stock moving to the upside here after hours up nearly 8% of course, so you're to date still well in the red off just around 68%. Michelle. All right, thanks, Sean. Well, my stock to watch for tomorrow is Delta. We've been talking about airlines today. The airline reporting earnings ahead of the open and results are expected to show profits and revenue rising from a year ago. The estimates earning for share of $1.55 on revenue of $12.89 billion. Now the stock has had a rough year so far underperforming the SFP 500 the last three months you saw they down to 6%. But there is some optimism on the sector as people return to traveling post pandemic, especially with the strong dollar. So certainly one to watch for tomorrow morning. All right, coming up Netflix has its site set on the Jersey Shore. We'll tell you why and what the streaming diet hopes to accomplish after the break. Thanks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,97,2022-10-12 20:54:30
3188," 2 exhale You know, I'm gonna get a little bit of a little bit of the same thing. Just my back last year from victims families, Dahmer, monster is Netflix's second most watch series. Yahoo, finances, Alexandra cannell is here with the details. All we talked about the fact that it was a hit right off the bat. I haven't watched it yet, but people love it. People love it. I haven't watched it yet either. I am. I'm happy to watch it. I've heard it's an emotional roller coaster, but America has a massive amount of money. I've seen it in a mass more than 701 million hours viewed, making it the second biggest series to date for Netflix behind stranger things. So it actually de-throwned Bridgerton. And you know when you're dethroning Bridgerton that you have a massive, massive hit on your hands. For a little context behind that number, stranger things season four racked up 1.35 billion hours viewed in the first month. So the fact that Dahmer even came close is a big deal. So I think it's really a big deal. So I think we're doing really well. Great thing for Netflix, but also a great thing for Ryan Murphy. This is his third year into his five year contract with Netflix. He signed a $300 million deal back in 2018. And this is really the first series from him to really drum up that big response that Netflix wanted. So people have been a little critical saying whether or not Dahmer is really worth that $300 million price tag. And it's not going to be giving out $300 million contract. And Shonda got one too. She got one too. And that was huge to follow up. That was the heyday of Netflix when they didn't care. They were just giving out money left and right. That's not going to happen in car. But true crime. Obviously it's a win every time. And obviously a lot's changed since those 300 million dollar deals, including a considerable subscriber fall off this year for Netflix. But the streaming giant has ended running to build a massive production company. And I think it's going to be a little bit more about that. Yes, you said it 300 acres Jersey Shore about 50 miles from New York City, New Jersey governor. Phil Murphy is all about this. He's been dying to bring some more Hollywood productions. Two New Jersey. There's a lot of artists. There's a lot of creatives there, especially with the close proximity to New York. And if this deal does go through, it'll be the second largest studio for the company after New Mexico. So we could be able to do that. So I'm really happy to be able to do that. So I fully approve this move by Netflix. But we'll see what happens once this deal officially goes through. They were in talks last year. So despite the profitability struggles, despite the fact that they've been losing subscribers, they still seem to be full steam ahead on this. So that just indicates to me that they want to produce more content and better content. And all they can do out trying to track those new subscribers. All right, it's been a scary year for snap. Shots shares down more than 75% this year. But snap rolling out a new activation during this spooky season. You can now virtually try on and buy Halloween costumes directly on the Appia partnership with costume design and manufacturing company disguise. We decided to give it a try and sticking with the streaming theme there from Ali Netflix and Disney and Disney. I thought I'd go with the cobra Kai since that season five debut has been so successful. And Shana, Shana, what'd you go with? I did. Hocus Pocus. Sticking with the streaming theme here Disney plus. What is it's posture? Is your thing? No. Swap game. You guys can tell how much I've watched either of those and there's there's Jared Blyckery in the Ghost Busters. Unfortunately, who's at female Ghost Busters? I'll be right back. I think this is a really cool tool, especially being able to buy them right there on the app. I mean, I love it. I love how easy they're",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iE41vefT4k,98,2022-10-12 20:59:30
3189," I think this is a really cool tool, especially being able to buy them right there on the app. I mean, I love it. I love how easy they're making it for people because you know, there's always that rush. The closer you get to Halloween and it was like fighting for this and that. If you could just sit down and do it. Now the fit though might be an issue. I don't know because I feel like some of these Halloween costumes are quite small. So if you can look as good as you do with the pictures, I'm more for it. But I think I want to try it on in person. Just in case, although Jared is really selling me on this on this Ghostbusters outfit. I think you look very so serious. I think that's all done by me. I think it's interesting. Look, Snap has had a rough go obviously. It's the ad market and social has been difficult. But activations like this are smart. They have a really interesting activation with SoFi, Stadium where the Rams play football, the NFL's Rams where they use a filter, a snap filter on the jumbo charts, although show a fan and make them look all silly and crazy. I don't know what the investor story is per say. But it's nice to see some new activations. Well, and they're also not the only ones who are doing this too, right? We talked about Amazon. You're able to virtually try on shoes. They launched that earlier this summer. Pinterest and Google has also been starting to leverage AR to try and really separate themselves from some of the competition out there. And Lauren, some of those more customers. So I think it's a smart move from Snapchat. They need though. My one criticism, they need some more costumes though in terms of options. So we're going to have a lot of options at least just yet. But I might be co-brokai, Rachelle. I might be going there. Yeah, you're right. Trigney. It suits you. It suits you. I'm not going to lie. It did seem like your thing. And you had the serious face and the growth of the sleeves and everything. John's show, baby. I couldn't show. And you look lovely. And you look lovely, sort of. Well, that'll do. We'll have to leave it there. We'll have to see what we'll wear on Halloween. But that'll do it for today's edition of Yaya's Fine Arts Life. To the store at 3PM Eastern, we'll see you then. Bye.

Earlier in the case, Jones had been found liable for defamation. He is infamous, of course, for touting conspiracy theories and with sued by the families and that agent after repeatedly and falsely claiming the school showed shooting was a hoax with plaintiffs saying they were harassed by Jones' followers.

The Sequoans the Wall Street Journal, that service would reportedly be integrated inside of Tiktok. Bitesense actually already has a music streaming service called Rezzo, but it's limited to countries like India and Indonesia. Rezzo's poor revenue streams are reportedly a sticking point with record labels, right? All right, everyone. Well, let's keep tracking the markets here this morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ composite, all deeply in the red here, this after a hotter than expected is just seeing CPI print. And we've seen this decline initiated exactly in time with when that CPI report dropped from more on today's activity. Let's get on over to Jared Blyckery at the Wi-Fi Interactive. Jared, what are you seeing in the tape this far? Ouch. That's what I'm saying today. Let's take a look at the NASDAQ. That's down the most here, over 2 and a quarter percent. Over the last four days, so this week it's down another 4%. Let's check out the last seven days because we had some down drafts last week down another 9%. When we look inside the market, only energy has been in the green crude oil, actually under a little bit of water here. And we'll talk about that in a second, but consumer discretionary, just taking it on the chin and down another 2.75% followed by tech and then real estate. Let's take a look inside the NASDAQ here. We got Amazon down 4.5%. I believe it's just about to test its lows of the years. Here's the year-to-date chart. You can see, indeed, here we go trying to see if we can bounce from there, but too early to see if that's going to happen just yet. Tesla hitting another one year low. It has now taken out these May, June, July, rounded bottom lows here, so that is down 40% this week. And if you want to know the culprit, you got to take a look at the US dollar. I'm going to show you one of our screens here. This is our heat map of the US dollar versus everything else. The pound, a very interesting scene that's going on there, also the Japanese yen. By the way, the pound, the Bank of England, maybe scrapping those tax cuts in favor of, guess what, tax heights in a month, but that US dollar very much weighing on equity markets here also want to get a quick check of crude oil as a lot of criticism heaped on OPEC plus, including the international energy agency itself, haven't seen that in a while. So what's going on here? Crude oil down 4.10% of a percent, guys. Jarra Blickery, thanks so much.

The longtime activist semester is now urging the company to make changes to its board, including replacing the chairman or face another proxy fight. Coles shares are down by nearly 50% so far this year. This is where we find Sazie's. I got to say I thought the activists had already done this. Like they've leveled so much at the company I just figured that this was already part of it. This is, right. This is McHellam and Jonathan Duskett and he's been on many times with us talking about his views on Coles. Well, guess what? He's still over 5% holder in Coles and he's tired of this crap.

He's been on this board for 14 years and I think Jonathan really put a lot of cut up him briefly this morning. He put a lot of thought, I think, to crafting this letter. He wants to work with Coles, except that Coles is bored. Notably, Bonepartth has not want to work with him and really drive any change. This has been an absolute disastrous year for this company. I would argue disastrous three years under CEO, Michelle Gast, terrible job. This year, you came out of the second quarter with a major inventory bulge. Oh, guess what? Keep in mind a couple of months ago, they had a really what appeared to be a solid offer to take Coles' private at $53 a share. Look where this stock is trading out right now. It's $26. That is massive value destruction. What Duskett is calling here, he's tired of Peter Bonepartth. He's tired of some other board members that what he calls a shadow board that is preventing the company from making any operational changes. He wants some of these long-tangled Coles people off this board so some positive fundamental changes can happen. He's not calling for the company to be sole per say. He just wants to see it better run so the stock price could go up because the results improve. It really is that simple and worth noting too. It is interesting. I remember very briefly covering Jones' a power group when Bonepartth was CEO many years ago. He didn't want to sell the company back then and that's why in many respects he was ousted and it looks like he's running the same plane book at Coles. But again, this is situation not going anywhere and frankly guys it's one that continues to baffle me. How this board can continue to be overbordered with cushy paychecks at the same time they're not delivering. Same goes for the management team. It's really, really strange. Coles shares down 47% a year to date. We're continue to track those shares of Kate, S.S. We're coming up on the other side of this short break. Our founder and CEO Kathy Wood. And if you're on this for an exclusive interview you do not want to miss this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,2,2022-10-13 14:01:21
3194," An exclusive interview you do not want to miss this. It is Thursday, October 13th here in New York City on Brad Smith with Julie Hyman and Brian Stasi and Ugly Day on Wall Street after another red hot inflation report. CPI month over month coming in at 4 tens of a percent in a move higher. The economic data keeps on coming. Jewels over to you for some housing news as well right now. 6.92 percent Brad that is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage. That data just coming out to us from Freddie Mac. 6.92 percent by the way is the highest going back to April of 2002. All of this of course goes back to the Fed raising interest rates and also has already had ripple effects throughout the housing market putting pressure on pricing, putting pressure on demand and affordability. We've been watching these mortgage numbers very, very closely because obviously they have really ratcheted up the monthly cost for people who are taking out a 30 year mortgage in order to buy a house. So we've got that number, we've got that CPI number all of it pointing to continued inflation at least for now. But now we're joined by someone who has her eyes on potential deflation. That of course is Kathy Wood, our Founder and CEO and you recently wrote an open letter to the Fed where you warned about deflation. We talked to Michael Darda of MKM at the top of the show where he said the Fed is making the mistake of looking at backward looking indicators. What should the Fed be looking at Kathy when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation? Sure. Hi Julie. Hi.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,3,2022-10-13 14:05:29
3195," What should the Fed be looking at, Kathy, when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation? Sure, hi, Julie, and Brian. Well, if you look at what's happening in the pipeline, what you're seeing in terms of commodity prices are some very serious declines both from their peaks and year over year now. So that is sort of, we would say that's upstream inflation that is heading towards the PPI and then ultimately the CPI. So we've got gold prices, and in fact, I looked at them yesterday. I had thought that the last two years gold had been trading within a 1700 to nearly $2,100 range, and that's true it has, and it has broken down. This is a really good leading indicator of inflation. What caught my surprise yesterday was looking at where gold was in 2011, it was roughly this level. So you can say since 2011, more than 10 years, we haven't had a big burst in a big breakout in the gold price. And that is informing our decision here. Gold is a leading indicator of inflation, and it has not broken out, it is breaking down. And then the second thing that we're looking at is the inventory glutt around the world, and especially in the United States, it looks like some of the best supply chain managed companies in the world have overordered, they ignored their automated enterprise resource planning system so ERP systems and double ordered triple ordered so that Nike, for example, its sales were up only three and a half percent globally last quarter, and yet its inventory was up 44%, and in the United States, they were up 68%, and if you look at it in transit, they're up 85%. So that's just one indication we're seeing lots of inventory overhangs, and even online sales are suffering. Amazon just had its second prime day, and it showed no increase, which is really from a year over year, which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CPI that we got today is a lagging indicator. It always is a lagging indicator, and we're seeing a lot of prices in the pipeline that are falling. So, Kathy, let's talk about what this means for the Fed, and your open letter to the Fed, where you urge them to consider some of what you're talking about right now. The market after today's data is now more fully pricing, and not just a 75 basis point increase at this upcoming meeting, but at the one after that as well. Do you think the Fed should be done? Do you think they should even raise 75 basis points at this upcoming meeting, or do you think they should stop here and give some time for their increases to make their way through the economy? Yes, as we're thinking about this question, we compare what Chairman Powell is doing to what Chairman Volker did in the late 70s, early 80s, when he was fighting an inflation problem that had been building for 15 years, Vietnam War, great society closing the gold window. That was a real inflation problem that built up over 15 years. This inflation problem has been 12 to 15 months by the time the Fed started addressing it, and we think it's much more a function of supply chain imbalances caused by COVID, and then again, by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These are very, very different circumstances. So what the Fed has done this time around is it has increased interest rates. If they go another 75 basis points, which is very likely on November 2nd, they will have increased interest rates from 0.25 to 4%. And that's a 16 fold increase. What did Volker, in the early 80s, he took interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a two fold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,4,2022-10-13 14:09:33
3196," interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a twofold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to dealing with inflation and working around it over 15 years. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications. In many ways, we're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're gonna see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession and we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. Kathy, so do you see a severe recession? And then how long do you think this bear market will continue? Well, what's interesting, I think many people are coming around to the idea that we're in a recession or we're going into a recession. The first two quarters with real GDP growth negative to us means we're in a recession. And now that many people are worried and are beginning to see recession for us far as the eye can see, we are looking at this recession a little bit differently. We think it's going to be a function of this massive inventory overhang and that it's going to be a serious inventory correction, but it's not going to be anything like we saw in 0809. That was a systemic financial problem caused by the mortgage and financial meltdown. We don't think this is the same thing. So now that many economists are starting to agree with us that we're in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit too alarmist. If this is just an inventory recession and I think the Fed will have a lot to do with whether or not it is. This is a shock though to the system and this idea that we have an inventory overhang, we think it's going to get bigger as consumers pull back low saving rates, 3.5% versus 8% where it was before COVID. And so we'll see. We think this holiday season is going to be pretty tough. And so as you kind of read it, you're shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, and you think about some of the ways that equity valuations are starting to price in that recession to the best of their ability. Is there a big buy that you now kind of think through or evaluate going into the end of the year here? Well, you have to consider the source here and our focus, our sole focus, is on disruptive innovation. And we also believe that innovation solves problems. We had a tough time going into COVID with our kind of strategy and then we had a boom in our strategy during COVID because guess what? We needed the genomic revolution to help sequence the coronavirus and figure out tests and vaccines and our kinds of companies helped with that. We think with supply chain issues and with the food and energy prices caused by this shock, this rushes invasion of Ukraine, that once again, innovation is going to help solve these problems. Electric vehicles, there's an accelerated consumer preference shift towards electric vehicles like Tesla because of oil prices. And we think there's no stopping that trend now. And in terms of food prices, we do believe that gene editing is going to help us figure out how to produce crops in areas that are less fertile than the Ukraine, the bread basket of Europe, with less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. So we're going to continue to see the miracles associated with the genomic revolution. But our other strategies as well, whether we're talking about robotics, solving the labor shortage, energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,5,2022-10-13 14:13:56
3197," energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become more competitive if they use their data and combine it with other data in effective ways. And then blockchain technologies, which is going to take the middle men out of a lot of businesses and take the cost out of a lot of businesses, helping us to solve this inflation problem. So again, consider the source. We think innovation solves problems. It certainly gave us an appreciation of that during COVID. Our strategy was high flying. And we think we have even more problems right now. So stay tuned. Kathy, this economic shock that you talk about in large part at the hands of the Fed, does that cause a shock to one of your long term holdings in Tesla in terms of the stock price and also the company's financials? Well, certainly all stocks are experiencing difficulty in this environment as the market tries to understand how far the Fed is going to go and how deep this recession is going to be. So Tesla, as I mentioned, is a solution to the problem. It's very interesting. If you look at gasoline demand this summer in the United States, it dropped below COVID levels, the worst of COVID, and it dropped to levels that we have not seen since 1997. That's real demand destruction. And it couldn't have happened. We do not believe without electric vehicles at the margin, taking huge share from traditional automobiles. So if we had to be concerned about an industry, it would be the traditional auto industry. We think that gas powered vehicles are going to be obsolete within the next five to ten years. And the traditional auto industry has to figure out a way to migrate into electric vehicles and into the next big phase, which we think Tesla is leading, the autonomous taxi platform phase. So lots of changes here. Traditional industries are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Kathy, when we last talked back in the spring, I believe it was just at the beginning of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. Now we are maybe, maybe getting to a little bit of closure in that case. But I would post you the same question that I asked you then, because a lot of time is elapsed in different events have happened. Are you at all concerned about Musk's attention wavering now that it looks like he is in fact going to be taking over and likely at least having a pretty heavy hand in running Twitter? Well, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You don't think that it'll be a mess if that happens. It'll just be sort of a free for all where it's tougher to find commentary of value. You know what's interesting about Twitter and we found this. We have a lot of debate around our own strategies. We can filter that debate ourselves. So we can unfollow people if we think there's bad behavior, but that's our choice. And we can follow those people who we think are moving discussions, whether it's about innovation or the economy, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there. And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,6,2022-10-13 14:18:09
3198," And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools to filter out the nonsense and get right down to business. I certainly would like to filter out a lot of the nonsense sometimes on their caddy. I want to ask you more broadly about our guests and your funds. I was looking at art K in particular and the fun flows that we have seen, which were seeing sort of bigger swings to the up end of the downside earlier in the year. They've gotten a little more muted as of late. You talk a lot about your three to five year time horizon, which I think makes sense, but I wonder how long how patient investors are going to be particularly in an environment where they are seeing losses, not just in our K, but in lots of other areas as well. Yes. And I think one thing that helps our clients is our research. And they see that it's first principles research. We have the long term time horizon. And we're seeing spectacular exponential growth opportunities. And not only one by one, the various platforms I just described, but the convergence of those platforms. So one ask her of feeding another. And I think many of our clients understand that they're short innovation, truly disruptive innovation. If you own the NASDAQ or the NASDAQ 100 right now, and you look through that index, this is not the index that I grew up with in the 80s and 90s when we were looking for innovation. We'd go to the NASDAQ. But if you look through the NASDAQ now, and especially the NASDAQ 100, what you see are 25% of the names touching disruptive innovation. The rest of them are kind of me too. They look like other indexes, the fangs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla would be our only overlap. And then you look further and more deeply into these indices. And you see names that you'd never expect to be there. Food and beverage, utilities, rails, brick and mortar retail. These are not innovation companies. So what we've done at ARC is we are pure play innovation. And we'd like to think we are what the NASDAQ used to be in the 80s and 90s. And it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long-term investment time rise. And so I think our sharing our research and our pointing out to investors, look, what you think you own in innovation is not what it used to be. And what ARC is doing is really back to the future. We're all about investing in the future as opposed to indexes, which are more about past success. Those companies that have been extremely successful have risen to the top of these indexes. But if we're right, in these five platforms that involve 14 different technologies are going to disrupt the traditional world order, then investors need to get to the right side of change. And one of the other things that we do, that's one of our missions and values, is to educate. That's why we give our research away. And we want to educate not only investors, but parents and grandparents about how the world is changing, how radically it's changing, and how it's ever more important to get, especially students on the right side of change, so that they can enjoy these incredible growth opportunities and not be disrupted by industries that will be sunsetting, shall I say? Kathy, a three to five year time horizon means not only kind of midterm or recession proofing your companies, you're not just recession proofing your portfolio, you're also kind of midterm proofing your portfolio, you're a general election proofing your portfolio. And so, you know, Eric, how do you go about identifying disruptive innovation that then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda? Well, one, we have a six metric scoring system, very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,7,2022-10-13 14:22:30
3199," very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. Thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy. And so in the early days of ARC in 2014-15, we were thinking, okay, government may be very concerned about the safety of autonomous vehicles. But as we've moved through these last eight years, what we've seen, thankfully, is the government and regulators in particular, very focused on data. And what does the data say? The data says that most fatalities and accidents, 85, almost 90% of them are caused by a human error. If we take the human being out of the equation, then we're going to save up to 35, 40,000 lives in the United States, the fatalities per year, and up to 1.25 million around the world. So that is a noble goal. And we've been very gratified to see the regulators looking at the fatalities in Tesla's vehicles and informing us that for the most part, most of those fatalities were caused by human error. And for the second, that people who are driving Tesla vehicles are much safer thanks to the various automated driving capabilities now. Up to 40% safer than in most other cars. So we're very focused on what governments are studying in terms of the data. And if they stick to the data innovation typically, it solves problems and makes the world a better place. Really, always a treat to get some time with you. Kathy Wood, ARC, Invest Founder and CEO, always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Appreciate the time. Brian, Julie as well. Thank you. Thank you. All right, let's stand in the economy here. Inflation is still running hot as we saw in today's consumer price index. That comes as economic growth continues to be sluggish and recession calls pick up on Wall Street. Let's dive into the economic outlook with Jar Bernstein, who is a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jarred, always great to talk with you. I don't know if you heard, but we just had a noted investor, Kathy Wood, on calling for a potential economic shock because what we're seeing with inflation and the Fed will have to get your take on it. Well, I think the underlying fundamentals when it comes to particularly the labor market remain very strong in this economy. And that's a really important tail when family budgets are challenged by these high price levels. So when you have an unemployment rate of 3.5%, you're adding hundreds of thousands of jobs for a month, 10 million jobs since this President got here. That's going to help working families offset some of the pressures they're facing on the price side. But it certainly doesn't get the job done. We've got a lot more to do in that space. And that's why, at the direction of the President, we have focused, like a laser, on doing all we can to ease price pressures on the supply side of the economy when it comes to the ports, when it comes to shipping costs, air freight costs, energy costs. And of course, the Inflation Reduction Act with its reduction in costs for medical care, for premiums, for prescription drugs, and also for clean energy. So I think the question is, A, is there a strong labor market at your back, the answer is yes, B, is this administration doing everything we can to help ease those pressures, also a firm yes on that one? Jared, I want to pick up on the energy part of all of that. In particular, listen, I know you're not a foreign policy guy, but obviously what's been going on between the US and Saudi Arabia has been getting a lot of attention. And the Saudi support of the OPEC production cut, which has been problematic for the global energy market. If we were looking for prices to continue their downward trajectory, what can the White House do and what is it doing domestically in terms of continuing to push for more production domestically? Well, let's set the level here with just a little bit of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,8,2022-10-13 14:26:59
3200," domestically in terms of continuing to push for more production domestically. Well, let's set the level here with just a little bit of a background on what's been going on in energy markets because I certainly agree with a lot of your characterization, but we got that in the CPI report this morning, which is a motivation for our discussion, a gas prices are actually down about 5 percent in September and at an annualized rate of almost a third, about 30 percent in the third quarter. And of course, that reflects almost 100 days of declining gas prices. Now to get to your question, and also to reference back what I was talking about in terms of what this White House can do to help, that reflects the very large distribution of 180 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserves. That's ongoing to be clear. It's another 10 million barrels coming October, November. So that's an ongoing addition to global supply. But we have to do more, especially in the light of this misguided, and I think a very wrong headed decision by OPEC Plus. I'm not going to talk about the geopolitics that's not my lane. I will say the president has consistently since then gone out and talked about the importance of sharing some of those wide profit margins with consumers to give them a bit more breathing room at the pump. If you look at the spread between the wholesale and the retail price, it's still quite elevated. But let's not forget that at the pump, the national price, about $3.90 gallon, is down over a dollar from its peak in June. We need to see more of that kind of breathing room for consumers, and that's one of the things we're going to keep pressing on. The reality is that individuals households, they can't afford to stop spending on some of the necessities, whether that's food, whether that's energy prices, whether that's some of the rent prices even that we've been tracking. And so even with a longer, more protracted, kind of an era of higher inflation, higher prices that people are paying, what do you believe from the White House side are some of the longer term implications of that that may also begin to show up on the back end? So here's my answer to that. I think when you're thinking about that question, which looks around a corner, corners are very hard to look around right now. As you know, everybody's crystal ball is kind of cracked. Inflation is a global phenomenon. It's higher in many other countries than it is here. But I think the right thing to do is ask yourself, are the institutions most directly responsible for this challenge doing what they need to do? The Federal Reserve absolutely yes, okay? They're their pivot, they're tightening campaign. I'm not going to get into the details because we stay out of their knitting, but they're very much engaged as they should be the president has endorsed that pivot. Are we doing everything we can as I've tried to explain yes in the energy space and the supply chain space helping to unsknarl supply chains, inflation reduction act, ship sack, infrastructure act helping to boost the economy supply site. Our policies, makers doing what they need to do. Is it taking effect? Well, if we dig into the inflation report today, we see goods inflation was actually flat in September. That's useful, but of course, housing inflation, shelter inflation created more pressures. Well, is the feds action cooling the housing market unequivocal? Yes, it takes time for that lag to work its way into the CPI, but we're already seeing some cooling in the housing market actually non-trivial, both on the rental side and the ownership side. I'm chair, just very quickly. We've been starting to hear not just from Kathy Wood, but other economists that inflation forward looking inflation indicators are already starting to come down. So just to put your pure economist hat on for a moment, is inflation going to take care of itself? Should the fed and the White House actually maybe take a step back here and say inflation will come down without us having to push things into a recession? Well, I think that's a complicated question that gets into a lot of debates, some of which would have me a lot more into the feds knitting than I'm willing to go in this position. You're right when I was a pundit chin-flapping plane. I get into this all day. It's a good question, but from our perspective, we want to respect the feds independence. I think the question again redounds quite simply to the following. The fed is the first and foremost inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,9,2022-10-13 14:31:20
3201," But from our perspective, we want to respect the Fed's independence. I think the question again redounds quite simply to the following. The Fed is the first and foremost inflation fighter. This President has said we deeply respect their independence. So we're not going to comment on their granular policy, but he has said that this pivot that they've made is a very appropriate pivot given the challenge of price pressures. On our side, you've seen, well, let me put it this way. I have never been part of a White House or any other job in my long political economy career, where we've done more to try to help on the economy supply side. I never talked about dwell time in my long career. That's the amount of time that containers spend in ports. Now I wake up every morning and check dwell times, and they are significantly down through put through the ports is at historical levels, shipping costs, air freight costs, down significantly. Those actions have our fingerprints on it. We worked closely with the private sector, so there's a real partnership there. But again, the question to get away from the granular who's doing the right thing and the timing of all that, very complicated, quite. Nobody has the right answer to that. What you really need to ask is are there relevant institutions that fight inflation doing what they need to do? And the answer for this White House and for this Federal Reserve is an unequivocal yes. Jared, all of us have gotten to get a big education about supply chain terminology to be sure. Jared Bernstein, member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, thank you so much for your time this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, we'll get another check on markets and dig into some of the moogers here as we see. A market's still sharply in the red, but well off the lows here. This is Yahoo Finance Live. We are seeing stocks still lower the Dow right now off of 186 points, about 1%, but as you can see, we are well up off the lows of the session here, even though we are still sharply lower. So that initial alarm over CPI, fading a little bit as people try and game out what the Fed is going to do. Next, we are seeing a similar phenomenon with the S&P, although it's still down 1.2% or so, and the NASDAQ down about 1.9%. So likewise, we continue to watch what's going on with yields here, the 30-year-yield 3.9.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,10,2022-10-13 14:35:51
3202," down 1.2% or so and the NASDAQ down about 1.9% or so. Likewise, we continue to watch what's going on with yields here. The 30 or yield 3.92% and the 10-year yield coming just a hair back below 4%. Also in terms of movers, we're watching shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Bloomberg is reporting that the two grocers are in talks potentially to combine that an announcement could come as soon as sometimes this week or the next week. The Albertsons shares, sharply higher Kroger shares, a little bit lower. Coming up, we're going to battle it out in our bull versus bear segment this week. So the focus will be on meta, put on your VR goggles, we'll be right back. Welcome back. It is time to battle it out in our bull versus bear segment for the week. This week we put the spotlight on meta. Need him, senior analyst, Laura Martin has an under-perform rating on the stock saying costs will exceed revenue growth over the next two years. Welcome Laura. We've also got Aby Bernstein, senior analyst, Mark Schmohlich, reiterating his outperform rating saying he sees light beyond the dark. Welcome Mark as well. Okay, so let's get into this. First and foremost, we've got to talk about the advertising revenue right now for meta platforms, especially as so many companies are pulling back on some of their ad spend really looking at some of their cost restructuring as well. And so Laura, I want to go to you first on this as we see even more of that demand for digital advertising continuing to unfortunately see this vacuum given the restructuring that many companies are doing. What does that mean and net out for what should we should expect going forward for meta platforms and the underlying subsidiaries and Facebook Instagram? You're right. The macro environment continues to deteriorate. We think many ad driven companies will miss their fourth quarter earnings. In meta's case, not only is just the macro environment deteriorating, but they're losing a lot of user time to tick talk. And that continues to happen. Tick-tock now is up to 75% share of adults under 25 here in America, which is the highest ARC per region for meta. So we're worried about both ad unit availability as people move time into tick-tock and we're worried about demand softness at the advertising level and 100% of meta's revenue comes from auction. So if you have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,11,2022-10-13 14:39:58
3203," people move time into TikTok and we're worried about demand softness at the advertising level and 100% of Meta's revenue comes from auction. So if you have a falling demand for units, you get light pricing for the units that you do have to sell. Mark, when I get your reaction to that, I mean, you're calling this a make or break quarter for Meta. Absolutely, you know, and I think Laura's right that there's certainly all these, you know, the very loud bear case right now where, you know, it is time to prove it even in this tough macro environment and, you know, there's really kind of three legs of things that they that they need to go off and, you know, effectively dispel one is on the engagement side. And, you know, since they had that for one quarter where they lost a million users, they've gained about 40 million Facebook glue users. Now granted much of that's international, but domestic sell fine. On the revenue front, it is a tough macro, but, you know, we're seeing them actually set up a little bit better actually starting to gain back some share while it from advertisers. Primarily as, you know, they've made some improvements on advantage, sorry on, you know, the idea of a front, they've launched advantage plus, which certainly helps a lot of advertisers, you know, make decisions around kind of automating the, the ad delivery process. And they've launched a lot more ad inventory ramping up advertising load on reels, launching new ad inventory elsewhere. And so, you know, we're starting to see them make progress against much that's been weighing down the stocks since the end of last year. Mark, wanna stay with you for a hot second? The reality of the revenue construct for, for meta, especially as they make a big push into the metaverse, I mean, my goodness. Are we gonna be buying $1,400 glasses to wear augmented reality glasses to wear within our households or even at work? Who knows? I bought one, not saying everybody else, well, so let's write it out. But, you know, I think where we are right now, that certainly captures the headlines and certainly the number that they've been spending, you know, to kind of build out that meta, their metaverse ambitions is, you know, certainly kind of stickers. Not to change the whole name. Exactly right. You know, but I don't think that matters right now for the stock to work, right? Because I think the stock is back to questions around really core fundamentals, folks can understand, you know, that that's like a more long-term initiative. I imagine investors will love it if they were spending a lot less on it. I think we're gonna see some of that discipline. They're not gonna ban anything at all. You know, but you certainly see discipline that, you know, investment in growth areas is gonna be tied to core performance. You know, and so I think investors do need to see that discipline. And so long as engagement is holding and revenues are turning the corner off the bottom, you know, I think they kind of will allow them to continue to kind of build up, even if it's not necessarily desired, but you know, it's certainly a long-term view for sure. Laura, you've called Metacio America's CTO. So what do they need to get right with the metaverse for that to actually hold true? And that figure is Mark Zuckerberg. Yep, so we need to make a distinction between the stock call, which my attitude is, why would you ever get an invest in a stock where you're spending $10 billion a year, but the payoff is in 2030. You should go sit somewhere else. Energy is fine with me or banks, don't care. Those are all fine, but do not sit in a stock that pays off in 2030, which is the stock call. I think what he's talking about in terms of changing the world of computing for consumers is really innovative and interesting and risky. But bringing on the CEO yesterday of both Microsoft and Accenture, great. Says he's got some great enterprise partners and I don't think consumers want to pay $1,500. I think that's the exception. But I think Accenture could pay by thousands of $1,500 goggles. So I think it's interesting what he could do for America and for the consumer over a 10-year frame. Having said that, you know, I would say that, you know, we would move to the sidelines and use meta as a source of funds because that's no place to be as the return on capital deteriorates. Just as we wrap up this conversation, wanna get both of your kind of biggest risks for meta. And I mean, if I'm gonna bring myself into this conversation, it really is who that consumer is because it's about the time spent on these platforms and engaging even with the hardware that they decide to move forward with in order to make either the metaverse real or to just drive up engagement in the screen wars, if you will. Laura, I'll start with you. I think Mark Zuckerberg is telling us he doesn't think he has a core business. He is moving to Reels because it competes with TikTok.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,12,2022-10-13 14:44:39
3204," I think Mark Zuckerberg is telling us he doesn't think he has a core business. He is moving to Reels because it competes with TikTok. He is moving to the metaverse and he's changed the name of this company, which tells me he doesn't think his core business that he built 15 years ago is actually a business anymore. Otherwise, why would you do these two things at once? Take on an extra $10 billion a year in metaverse spending in a midst of a recession in the ad market on the revenue line? So I think the big question here is, is there a core business that meta that can persist and has an exit multiple? Mark, what about you? Yeah, look, if you take a look at the motivations behind it, we've gone through these changes in the past from desktop to mobile. Mark and the team over there at Meta certainly remembers that well with the existential questions of should they build an app and participate in that ecosystem. And then in the meantime, they've been hit by changes that Apple makes, the gatekeepers in this current environment make. And so they understand that at some point there's going to be another computing platform change. They don't want to be stuck in the application layer. Now, I don't think that is a signal that the core business is certainly kind of, you know, expiring or anything like that. Now, there is certainly this barricade that at some point, you know, social media does go the way of my space or, you know, or Yahoo, but the data is not as important. What is it all social media that goes the way of my space? No, it isn't. And I think, you know, we miss, you know, kind of sitting here in the West that, you know, abroad, Facebook is internet. That's how people access it. And if you kind of take a look at the global charts of who's downloading new apps for the first time, Facebook and Instagram are right at the top. Now, a great, a lot of that's international, but it's still massively growing. We're still growing global internet penetration. And Facebook remains important for how you access it. But, you know, I don't want to fault the company for figuring out that if you're Apple sitting here, yeah, we should try to build an iPhone to kind of, you know, participate and own the next new thing. You know, I understand the motivations behind it. It's a long-term view. Doesn't mean that there's any issue. We still use desktops. So I don't think there's anything to kind of suggest from that investment aside from perhaps the magnitude, you know, that there's any issues with the health of core. All right, we got to give you the gong for the Yahoo ding there. All right, Laura wins by two points. Need him, senior analyst, Laura Martin and A.B. Bernstein, senior analyst, Marc Schmiller, great to have you both here with us today. And everyone's coming up. We'll do a quick check of the markets.

3205," America has long run on Duncan, but a change in the company's rewards program. It has some loyalists rethinking where they go for their a Java run. Let's talk more about all things Duncan and what's on the menu here with Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Scott, great to get some time with you coming to us from inside a Duncan location. Curious on what you're seeing in traffic? There's so much economic cross-currents coming at consumers right now. What does that breakfast day part look like? Yeah, and first of all, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and I can't wait to talk about our new loyalty program, Duncan Rewards. In terms of traffic, you know, I've been listening to your segment all morning on inflation and everything that's going on with the consumer. We feel really good about the breakfast segment. We feel really good about our brand and how we stand tall. People need their coffee and their breakfast sandwich to start their morning, so we've seen really strong results for our brand in the last couple of months. Scott, full stop. I was critical to changes in the rewards program, but it's coming from a place of love. I have to dunk an app. I go to dunk it all the time, and a lot of other people seemed to have caught my vibe. Have you looked at what you made here and are making any changes now to respond to consumers? Yeah, so, and I know it comes from a place of love from you, Brian. Absolutely. Here's what I would say. We rolled out our Dunkin Perks program in 2014, and we haven't made any changes in the last eight years. And we went out and we talked to our core users and we said, what do you want from a program? And they said they wanted three things. They wanted more variety, because in the old program, you could just get a beverage. They wanted more flexibility, and we've now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves. They can buy a sandwich for their family, or a whole meal for the soccer team. And they said they wanted recognition. So big users like you want to be recognized. And we now have a boosted status. And so we've put those three things in place. We're really excited about this new program. We gave out four billion free points in the last three days, and the response has been overwhelming with positive. Okay, fair enough. That's good to hear, but the birthday drink is the, it's the industry standard. Like I know, I would like to get a free birthday coffee until I ultimately dropped dead and six feet under. I mean, do you think you'll bring that back? So we're talking about that for sure, Brian. But one thing we did do is, well, we did take that piece away. What we added is come in either the day before your birthday, the day of your birthday or the day after, get three times points, points that won't expire as long as you come a couple times a year. And you can actually get something besides just a beverage. You could get a donut, you could get a sandwich, you can get avocado toast, a lot more flexibility, which is what our guests wanted. So you're really monitoring some of the taste profiles, the trends on what consumers are moving towards in their purchases for anything from lunchtime to, you know, starting off the day. So where are you still seeing the most traffic at what point in the day to really make some of the menu decisions and changeovers there? Yeah, we're certainly a morning day part business. So 70% of our business happens before 11 AM. And honestly, when COVID happened and we had that shutdown, we were all very nervous when the commute was not happening. But people shifted their behaviors a little bit and they came to us a little later in the morning and they came for a couple beverages, maybe to share with their spouses while they're working at home. But really, the trend that's happening is all around ice beverages. And we invented ice coffee. We're a leader, whether it's ice coffee, whether it's cold brew, our new refresher line. It's all about ice beverages and great attachment with snacking items to that. Hey, Scott, it's Julie here. I mean, I gotta say it's like, I guess I want to know a little bit more about the whole recession, spending patterns, et cetera, because you sound super positive. And I'm just wondering what signs, if any, you see a trade down, for example, of a drop in traffic, of any kind of sign that, you know, the anecdotal and data pain that we are talking about every day, if you guys are seeing any evidence of that. Yeah, we do see some of it. And here's what I'd say anecdotally. What happens in our business is, when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a dunking or some of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,14,2022-10-13 14:53:07
3206," is when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a Duncan or some other restaurant, but especially with Duncan. I think after a couple days or a week, people realize they need their morning Joe to get started, right? They need their coffee to fuel their day and we've seen it come right back up. And I think uniquely positioned for us, Duncan, it is a value offering, right? So we've got great products, both beverage and food at a great price point at the speed of Duncan. I think that's an unmatched combination out there. Uh, Scott, I go to my local Duncan every Saturday, and it's just a ritual I have. And every time I'm in line, launch a huge in the morning, which is a good thing I'm sure, but everybody's buying coffee, notably iced coffee. How big a percentage is donuts now on your business and what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right. Ice coffee is the future that last year was the first year we sold more ice beverages than hot beverages. That's what the next generation of consumer wants. They want these iced cold beverages. They want highly colorful products that they can share on Instagram. But I will say our donuts, no one does donuts like we are. We are obviously a national and a global leader on donuts. You got to come try our spider donut, which we just rolled out for Halloween. We've got a jack-a-lantern donut. There's nothing more shareable and more fun and a nice treat to yourself than a donut. As you've got more people returning either to office or to schools that breakfast wars, that's continuing to brew and heat up, what's Duncan's positioning in that breakfast war? And what are going to be the keys to essentially helping it retain that consumer mind share and that dollar at the beginning of the day? Yeah, a couple things. First of all, we have an incredible brand with a lot of brand love. So we tap into that loyalty like that new program. The second is some degree of everyday value or targeted digital value. So through our app, we are going to have the ability to have laser-focused offers that go right to you and what you want and give you incredible value in our program. And then the last thing I'd say is we've got, it's through our app, our ability to order ahead. So Brian, when you see those long lines, you download the app, order ahead. It'll be ready when you get there and the crew will hand it to you and you'll be off and running for your busy day. Scott, I just, I need the birthday drink back. I'm going to Duncan anyway, lad. I'm going to get off of here. I'm going to Duncan. I just need the birthday drink back. Please, please. Brian, I'm going to come deliver coffee to you personally on your birthday. I'll take that. April 4th. There we go. Yeah, done. Deal. Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you guys. Coming up, everyone, we're going to do a final check of the markets on the other side of this short break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,15,2022-10-13 14:57:44
3207," Remember to subscribe and set the notifications on! Well, that was quite a two hours. Hope you enjoyed the ride. We certainly did, even as we see markets continue to sell off. The sell off is definitely not as acute as it was right after we got that CPI data. Right now you've got the NASDAQ still leading losses down 1.3%. But it was down double that earlier. SME 500 the same and has paired its losses to the lower end of the market. Well, that was quite a two hours. Hope you enjoyed the ride. We certainly did, even as we see markets continue to sell off. The sell off is only now down around 30 points. So could we actually end the day higher that would be quite something even with these ratcheted up interest rate expectations?

3208," The blickery in for a Keiko Fujita. And here's what I'm watching today coming in hot. Lower gas prices aren't low enough or high enough to keep a little inflation. It surprises to the upside-sending stocks lower. 100 bips on the Fed. For November, is that on their radar? We're going to chask ICG's Nick Brooks to break it all down next. Crude oil among the risk assets sliding after the numbers hit. This as the IEA says OPEC plus cost could tip the global economy into recession. We're going to speak with Saxo banks ahead of commodities on exactly that. And Ark Innovation Founder CEO Kathy Wood spoke with our morning team about its holdings. And that open letter to the Fed. We're going to bring you more from the conversation. First, let's get a check of the market action. It is a down day here. We can see the Dow off almost 100 points. Parents, some of those losses, S&P 500 and Nasdaq under water as well. And taking a look at the bond market. Wow, we saw the 13-week Keiko not shown right there scream higher, but also the 10-year. That is up about seven basis points in the five year, the lower part of the curve. That is up 12 basis points. And I want to check the Wi-Fi interactive now. I'm going to show you the S&P 500 futures. And this is going to show you what happened at 8.30 AM when we got the lowest or excuse me, the highest core CPI print this cycle. And that was a big down move in the futures. You can also see here 10-year treasury note futures, big down move there. That means the yields shot up. And I'll show you what happened to gold. Gold taking a leg lower even WTI crude oil. It did take that initial downside action, but that has been subsequently reversed. And we got to take a check on the world's, I think most proxied risk asset, I don't know the call it, that Bitcoin. That is also taking two legs lower. So no recovery insight for Bitcoin as it heads to 18,000. That is basically the low of the year. So pretty critical to watch this going forward. And Americans still feeling the pinch when it comes to the price of groceries in September, the price of food increased by 0.8% compared to August. Brooked to Paulmas here with the details. And where did we see some of these biggest jumps broke? That's right, one of the biggest categories. We saw the jumps in cereal and bakery products. Now this is considered the highest. Since the late 70s and early 80s, I was confirmed by Steve Reed and economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of course, those higher pricing being driven by higher gasoline oils, transportation, weighing on the cost of both groceries and farmers alike. Of course, energy costs here decreased by 2.6% gas laying down 5.6%. Making it cheaper to transport goods, but still higher. Of course, also Dickens is going to say consideration, rising worker wages and prices for impact costs like packaging, fertilizer there. And now here, if you take a look, cereal and bakery products being driven higher by, of course, that rushes Ukraine invasion that happened earlier this year. Also, fruit and vegetables being impacted here, up 10.4% due to a historic drought facing the western half of the country impacting crop yields there. We got to talk about egg inflation here. It looks like some items, including eggs are seeing a bit of a price decline. Others not so much. I just wondering what items are sticking out to you. That's right. Well, to make it clear, Americans can still inspect sticker shock here when they go to the grocery store. I did it. Yeah, exactly. There's really no relief just yet. Of course, we see right here that eggs, month of a month, down 3.5% milk, down 1.3%. But this is doable to some of the impact, some of the climate events that happened over the summer. Of course, egg expires were covering from the spring's avian influenza outbreak. That's what Dr. Michael Spenson of Wells Fargo telling me. But dairy dealing with a hot summer, they are in key markets. Also, vegetables dealing with that record, transportation costs, shipping costs, expected to decline here, but still taking a toll on prices here. And now if we take a look year over year, of course, higher prices across the board. Some of the highest increase here. Flower, lettuce, potatoes, margarine, milk, and eggs. Eggs, once again, seeing a bit of relief, but still up 30%. Now, Jared, as you know, this is a volatile index. They are hard to judge whether or not next month. We might see a tick up, a tick down there. But I also want to note that citrus, somebody to keep a look out here on Wednesday, the US Department of Agriculture, said that Florida's orange crop this year will be the smallest in 1943. Now, that's not even taking into account the effects of hurricane Irene. So lots of fold out here, but Americans still expecting higher prices across the board. Silver lining for you and I.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,17,2022-10-13 15:06:18
3209," not even taking into account the effects of hurricane Irene. So lots of fold out here, but Americans still expecting higher prices across the board. Silver lining for you and I, Broca, I hear that our lunch time is getting picked up today by corporate, but today only really appreciate that report in all seriousness. Lots of higher prices to digest. Young finances broke to Paul. Thank you. Sticking with this morning's CPI report, let's welcome in and Nick Brookes, ICG head of economics and investment research for his reaction to the numbers and Nick. Let me just get your thoughts, your frontline thoughts on those headline numbers here, especially that core reading, which just shot up excluding food at energy. Yeah, I think that's the key problem. I mean, the headline number has been sort of gradually coming down since June, but the real focus is on the core inflation, which of course is what the Fed really cares about. And that just keeps going up. And as you were highlighting, food inflation is very high. Shelter inflation has also been a key driver of the rate, healthcare costs, and pretty much across the board and services. So the problem with this type of number is, I don't think the Fed wants to continue raising rates. I think the Fed recognizes quite clearly that the economy is probably going into a slowdown over the next couple of quarters. But as long as those core inflation rates remain so high, they need to keep raising rates to keep it under control. So I think bottom line is, and the market seems to think we're going to get 75 basis points from the Fed in November. And now markets are starting to price potentially another 75 in December. So not a good place to be. Yes, I even saw 100 basis point raise in November being price as I think the probability was 2% max. But just goes to show you the extent to which the Fed, which has really been consistent on its messaging. I was going through the FOMC minutes that were released yesterday. No big surprises at CPI, of course, being the bigger report here. But we've seen central bank action out of the bank of England, the bank of Japan just get completely reversed. I mean, you look at the debt of the UK or the currency of Japan trading like emerging markets here. What do you make of the central bank or reaction? How painted into a corner are they? I think they're all painted into quite a severe corner. And I'm based here in the UK, and I won't start talking too much about the UK. But they're in a very, very tight spot. And I think the problem is central banks haven't faced anything like this since the late 70s, early 80s, where you've got extreme inflation. And it's broad-based. And the central bank recognized that growth is coming down. And if it wasn't for these inflation rates, they'd probably be cutting rates. But bottom line is they're worried that inflationary expectations could get out of control. And we'll get the feared wage price spiral that becomes self-fulfilling. So they have to talk tough. They have to act tough. Until inflation rates start coming down, even if it means recession. Well, and we've gotten comments from CEOs who may or may not be talking their books. But Jamie Dimon sticks out in particular, especially ahead of earnings, which we expect imminently this week. Tomorrow morning, and he's talking about another 20% decline in the S&P 500 already on its way there over the last couple days. Just wondering what you see in terms of the markets set up, any levels you're looking at. What are you looking for in the eventual rebound when we find a bottom finally? Yeah. I think there are a couple of things. My own view would be that a lot of the rate increases are in the market. So if you look at swap rates, if you look at forward rates, I think a lot of the central bank hikes that are coming are actually in the market. I think where perhaps the market has not yet priced appropriately is the risk of quite a severe earnings decline as we move into potential recession. So I think the PEs need to come down further and the earnings are also likely to come down further. So I think there is certainly likely to be more downside on equity markets. The other point though I'd make is I think very similar to what we saw during the COVID, the worst of the COVID pandemic. I think it will be very sector focused. I think there are going to be some sectors that are clearly going to be hit much harder than others in this type of environment. But there also be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,18,2022-10-13 15:10:30
3210," I think it will be very sector focused. I think there are going to be some sectors that are clearly going to be hit much harder than others in this type of environment. But there also be some sectors that will perhaps be less affected. So I think one does have to take a more nuanced approach if one has a medium term view on an medium term investment horizon. Investors need the nuanced view because the Fed is not playing the nuanced scheme. Well said here Nick Brooks, ICG, head of economic and investment research. Thank you for your time today. Thank you. Before we go to break, check in on shares of Delta. You can see that company if we can get it on the screen there in a second. The company beat on revenue in the third quarter and we spoke with CEO Ed Bastion who had this to say about airfare cost cuts that will benefit customers like you and me. We thought what happened earlier this spring when we pushed ourselves a little faster than we thought we could and the reliability suffered. So I'm confident we can get there by next summer. And as we bring that additional capacity back, that's going to help probably take a little bit of the pressure off of pricing for consumers. But more importantly for Delta, it's going to enable us to get much better cost productivity and we'll be able to pass along some of that cost savings onto our customers.

So moving into the fourth quarter TSMC warning that it's seeing demand bladdish right now. It's rebounding the stock It's up 7% but I also just want to mention that look the chip sector has been dealing with the fallout of the new government Regulations the Biden administration's export control. So you've got applied materials lamb research applied material saying that their fourth quarter is going to be Impacting impacted by this new regulation. So you've got this regulation on the one hand And then you got some of these chip makers that are talking about slowing consumer demand on the other hand impacting and keep in mind that the chip sector also is going through periodic cycles, so it was expected that in the second half of the year that we would see Demand slowed down slower and it's it's these stocks are such that the kind of they've kind of been the way the pandemic style stocks have been Really high during the pandemic and then losing steam this year Hey, we don't need any nuance on that we know the hit that they've been taking and a lot of green on that board It was read quite a bit earlier.

We have a mere Paul Schneider electric president North America And thank you for coming here today This is all part of your presentation at the innovation summit Las Vegas Just tell us a little bit about the event and what we can expect from that Well, first of all, thank you for having me and yes We're here with 1500 customers about 20% of the Fortune 500 is here and the conversation we're having is how do we move from an intent to action There's been a lot of commitments made about getting to net zero and that's great More of those commitments are getting certified with science-based targets, which is an important next step But really deploying the technologies and learning by doing is how we're going to create innovation that we desperately need and That's really what we're talking to our partners customers and broader strategic alliances about here The thing that's most important right now is that we remember that sustainability is also an efficiency driver So it's got a bottom line positive impact and I think that is going to be an acceleration point for all of the sectors And a lot of the impetus behind the eat well behind the clean air Movement and clean energy movement has to do with government subsidies just wondering what the status of that is We hear a lot about that with respect to Tesla and some of the other big makers, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes as well as we beef up our infrastructure It's government subsidies for sure especially for consumers and it'll act as a catalyst for consumers to make the right choices People want to do the right thing and if it can be also Providing a better experience then these incentives are just going to make that transition happen faster Think about people buying an EV once they buy an EV they have an opportunity to put solar in their home when they do that They can add a battery and then with technologies that we can work with the utilities to also make them Producers of energy and maybe even sell some of that back in the right environments to the broader grid So there's a real evolution where consumers are going to become prosumers And we think this evolution is going to be catalyzed by things like the inflation reduction act But I want to go back to my earlier point sure investment and clean tech is about also making environments more efficient Not just in terms of being more green but operation",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,20,2022-10-13 15:19:02
3212," reduction act. But I want to go back to my earlier point. Sure. Investment and clean tech is about also making environments more efficient, not just in terms of being more green, but operationally more efficient. So it actually saves money in the long term. And we've published research with the Schneider Sustainably Institute that in existing buildings, we can build payback periods under eight years, not only making the buildings more efficient and in places like Las Vegas at the largest Hilton property in the world, we're demonstrating that as an act of solution. What is what's some of the tech behind this, what you call next generation industrial technology that's being used to empower workers, specifically, how does this all fit together? So look, one key element is to bring digital into the space. As consumers, we've been living in the digital and internet era for about 20 years. But in the industrial space, data and digital assets are just being deployed at scale. And what digital does is it makes the invisible visible and brings all of that opportunities for optimization. What it also helps us do is take our scarceest resource, which is people, and help them focus on the most important places where they can innovate and be creative. That is also going to create a lot of new jobs. We think there's an incredible opportunity in the clean tech space and solar, the number of electricians we're going to need, and we're investing. In addition to working with people like Nika, the National Association of Electrical Contractors, we're investing with community colleges to make sure the next generation is ready to work in this IoT environment. Finally, we're also investing in manufacturing. We announced an additional $46 million invested in the United States to prepare for this wave of electrification. And that's on top of 100 million we invested in our factories last year. Well, appreciate your time here. I've got to leave it there. I'm here, Paul Schneider, Electric President in North America. Thank you. Coming up, if you think the S&P's 2022, excuse me, 2022 punch has been steep, spare a thought for Kathy Wood's flagship fund. It has plummeted at more than twice the pace. So how is she feeling? My name's like Tessla and Roku now. You're going to hear from her up next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,21,2022-10-13 15:23:24
3213," Built-Th глаза Cream cheeseーブリケк Welcome back. We saw a red inflation print this morning with CPI coming in at 0.4% for the month and Kathy Wood weighed on one of the prints and more with our morning show today with us now is Julie Hyman and Julie. Lots going on in that interview. She talked about golden deflation, but also the dreaded R word recession. Yes, and it was sort of linked in with what she's talking about with deflation as well. The chief see some deflationary impulses out there going on under the service, particularly in commanding. She did talk about gold. And so she talked about if indeed we are seeing deflation come down the pike, then the risk with the fed raising rates is that yes, we will see recession. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications in many ways. We're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession and we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP is probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. It's pretty interesting, Julie. Everybody talking about what the Fed is going to do in November and December, but a lot of traders already pricing in rate cuts for the end of 2023. I have to see how that pans out. But you also asked her about Elon Musk and the purchase Twitter, of course, Elon and Tesla being one of the great disruption plays that she has. But what are her thoughts on Elon taking over Tesla? Well, she doesn't have Twitter in the portfolio anymore. We should mention that, but she does have Tesla. And Tesla is one of the things that's done better in that portfolio amidst what has not done well overall. Right. The arc, arc, arc, that benchmark ETF is down more than 60% for the year thus far. It's down in today's session even as other things are turning higher. So I asked her, what's the risk that Elon gets distracted and are you worried about what he's going to do for Twitter? She said she's excited about what Elon Musk could bring to Twitter. Listen, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You know, it was interesting. I asked her, like, isn't it going to be a mess though? And there's all this stuff. And she said, no, she said two things. I thought we're as interesting. And one, she said she herself will be able to filter out. And she thought that a Twitter under Elon Musk could offer users maybe more filtering options. And so that it wouldn't necessarily be a noisy, harassing, ugly place under an Elon Musk scenario. We'll see. When it comes to Twitter innovation under the old regime, we just got that edit button after what, 10 years. So yeah, I think it could be a little bit chaotic. I'm interested to see all the changes. I hope it doesn't break. I don't think it will because as news people were, were prolific users of, we are. It's actually like Cathy Wood. Yes. Very prolific here. Thank you for that. And great interview, by the way. Thank you. And finances Julie Hyman. All right.

The idea is that users can use and manage the account directly from their existing wallet. Apple Pay was launched in 2014 and the joint credit card, Apple card was established by both groups in 2019.

Car coming up chorus of Doom sayers there was Jamie Diamond's recession called then the IMF saying the worst is to come now in a rare warning the IEA that is the international energy agency joins the negative sentiment brigade saying op-ed plus cuts could tip this world the entire world into a downturn that's up next welcome back let's take a look at the markets where we see a sudden reversal to the upside you can see the dial there up over 1% on the Wi-Fi interactive that's good for 362 points and change looking over the past four days looking at gains of just short of 1% there want to take a let take a look at the Nasdaq as well up about two thirds of a percent but you can see for the four days in this week it is down about one and a half percent also want to get a check on the bond market where we saw a yield screaming higher after that surprisingly high CPI point a print five year Tino yield is up 12 basis points as you can see right here 10 year also up but not as quite as much that's up about eight basis points 30 year that is at the highest level since 2007 that's up six and the 13 week which tracks what the Fed is doing with its benchmark interest rate that is up five basis points finally want to get a quick look at the sector action today everything except energy was in the red earlier now energy up 3% followed by materials that is a play on a weaker dollar perhaps maybe reversal going underway there financials up ahead of a lot of bank earnings that we're getting tomorrow as well as tech to the downside consumer discretionary taking a small hit now as well as real estate now on to oil OPEC plus slash shits production targeted by 2.1 million barrels per day last week the move threatened to raise gas prices in the U.S. and we're seeing as a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,23,2022-10-13 15:31:51
3215," Now on to oil, OPEC plus slash shits production targeted by 2.1 million barrels per day. Last week the move threatened to raise gas prices in the U.S. and was seen as a critical blow to the President Biden ahead of the midterm elections. Now today something of a rare warning. The International Energy Agency says higher prices could be a tipping point for the global economy as it sits on the brink of a recession. Now let's move to oil market fundamentals. Now joining us from Copenhagen is Oli Hansen, Saxo banks, head of commodities strategy, Oli, great to have you here today, a rare rebuke for the Paris-based agency, the IEA. What's going on behind this? Maybe some politics? Well it just clearly highlights Jared that we are seeing a politics playing an in greater part in this oil market. We're obviously still trying to work out what really happened last week in that meeting in the OPEC plus meeting. The initial response, I initially thought that this was a good for Russia and bad for the global consumer and it seems like that's the tone that's been adapted. It's really a dangerous game right now, cutting production at a time where we're seeing an economic slowdown because it does several things. First of all, as the IEA says, it carries the risk of hurting demand even more, but also carries the risk of central banks being more aggressively on the hiking foot for longer. That's clearly not what the market needs right now. We need to start to look for peak in these yields and peak in the dollar and so on. That potentially could prolong that period. Well let's talk about the dollar here. We've seen the dollar screaming higher versus all kinds of currencies including, I think the top three in the basket that I'm looking at are the Argentine peso, the Turkish lira and surprise surprise surprise surprise, the Japanese yen, which is a third largest currency traded in the entire world. That's quite a trio to have at the top, but I'm wondering with all these central bank actions with the Bank of England and also the Bank of Japan, seemingly running out of bullets here, all that action resulting in opposite movements in their prices that they wanted in the first place, what do you think the outcome is for global currencies led by the US dollar here? Well the response that we've seen so far today after that, higher than expected inflation print, could indicate that the market is starting to get into a bit of a selling fatigue in the stocks, buying fatigue in yields and the dollar. We've seen quite a sharp turnaround as you mentioned there. It could also just be the fact that the market say, well we are clearly going to see a turnaround in inflation sooner or later and we are getting closer and we can also see the sub components of the increase today that we are seeing some sub-components down to ease down a bit. So there is expectation that inflation will peak, but at the same time also that will bring us to the point where we potentially could start to talk about peak hawkishness and that really could be a turning point when the Fed, when we get the idea that the confirmation that the Fed is starting to look in the other direction because that could be the beginning of some dollar weakness which the global economy is sorely neat right now and also lower yields which we also add some most ability to the market. Well Lisa, a little tamping down of the volatility that we've seen there in the yields market, but I want to take it back to commodities looking at the Wi-Fi interactive here. This is commodity prices over the last month and up in the upper left is heating oil. That's up 14 percent followed by orange juice. That's up 11 percent maybe something to do with hurricanes there, but then our Bob Gasoline wheat aluminum. The list goes on here. Are we in fact seeing maybe another upturn in the commodity cycle here after a bit of a respite where we saw a lot of these prices just club down to very low levels this year? Well that is our general outlook that we are in a situation where we see tight supply across several markets basically supporting prices enough to put prices even on a further upward trajectory. Even though we have this worries about economic slowdown, but if we look at the the the the market you just mentioned there apart from the hurricane which is impact the orange juice it is really it's got Russia written all over it. It's sanctions potentially on on aluminum. It's Ukraine wheat supplies and it's a diesel demand because we are we are here in Europe getting close to the embargo which means we have to find out these levels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,24,2022-10-13 15:36:23
3216," on aluminium, it's Ukraine, wheat supplies, and it's a diesel demand because we are here in Europe getting close to the embargo, which means we have to find out these levels where we are already now having a multi, well at least a decade low diesel stock in the US. We did have the report coming out earlier today and it just shows that diesel stocks continue to drop. So that's really a substitution for gas right now and that's right, these price size elevated as they are. We have to leave it there but really appreciate your insights here, Saxo banks, head of commodity strategy, Oli Hansen, thanks for joining us from Copenhagen, enjoy your evening. All right, let's get to our chart of the day and this has to do with a part into demand, which is starting to ease according to real estate data provider, real page, it's all rental demand, turn negative in the third quarter for the first time in 30 years. Negative demand means more people are moving out than in suggesting that higher rent prices are taking a toll on would be renters after last years, resurgent and rental demand, having moved recently myself, experiencing 37% price increases, I can testify to this rental inflation and sticking with real estate mortgage rates have jumped to their highest level in more than two decades. The average rate on a 30 year fixed loan increased to 6.92% as of today, Thursday, according to Freddie Mac's weekly survey, last time we saw that was April 2002. Coming up, crypto check a big down day for Bitcoin and friends as investors await the next meaningful jolt higher but does a drop in volatility being a break away from stocks. We'll take a closer look next. Markets now green after this morning's CPI report, you got to take a look at this on the Wi-Fi interactive. These are the futures, S&P 500 futures.

3217," After this morning's CPI report, you've got to take a look at this on the Wi-Fi Interactive. These are the futures, S&P 500 futures. Now up over one in three quarters of a percent, I want to show you what happened at 8.30 AM. Got this huge drop here, but now we are higher than we were just before the report. And if we take a look at the year-to-date action on the S&P 500, this is pretty significant here when you're going up on a bad news day. That is potentially bullish. We got a firm rejection of these lows here around what is at 3,600 or 3,500. And so we're going to have to see if this continues. But I want to show you a very similar market. It just in terms of price reaction. Here we have Bitcoin. Now we did get this big down draft at 8.30 AM, followed by another one a bit later. And now we are heading higher. But you can see Bitcoin not reclaiming all of those losses. But we want to stick with this. The crypto market and joining us now to discuss how it's huge. Roberts quant insight head of analytics. And we want to get your take on what's going on with Bitcoin this morning. And because it's had an incredible correlation with stocks, particularly the tech sector. Absolutely. Actually, you've just taken my punchline now away from me. So what quant insight does just to back up a second and to give some context is we look at macro factors. So growth and inflation measures of financial conditions like real yield, sleep of the yield curve, what feds up to and measures of risk appetite. And then we look at all different assets across equity markets, bond markets, commodities, FX. And more recently in the last few years crypto as well. And give a sense of the macro characteristics of that asset. And whether that asset is rich or cheap to prevailing macro conditions. For a long time, for a first couple of months of this year, crypto was not trading as a macro plate. It was trading off crypto technicals. But in April, it came into a new macro regime. And to your line, it is trading very much to characteristics of it are exactly the same. As a US tech stock. The difference being whereas S&P NASDAQ have all been cheap on our models beaten up in the last couple of weeks. Crypto looked expensive. So in a way, we've been waiting for this price action. The valuation gap is not extreme, but both Bitcoin and Ethereum, they both look modestly richer on our models and macro fair values world over while the swap price has been holding in there. So we've been waiting for price action like this. Let me ask you something because Bitcoin is knocking to the downside on the lows of the year, which also coincidentally happened to be the highs roughly speaking of that huge bull market in 2017. Many years ago, just wondering what you think in the price action happens, should that floor, temporary floor maybe be breached here? 18,000, what's the next level? Yeah, absolutely. Well, I would defer to Chartis and Tech Lannaries who know that better than I would. But yeah, Charting 101 tells you that if we take out those levels, then clearly it doesn't look good. And the crypto winter, which I think people hoped was beginning to go to maybe form a base. And could potentially be looking to reverse higher. This would suggest that actually the bear market was just pausing for breath and the charts would point to significant downside. But that's very much a technical analyst perspective. As I say, we come exclusively from a quantitative macro perspective. Well, let me extend that then to the general currency markets, where we've been describing. I've been talking about this almost the whole show the incredible strength of the US dollar that we've seen here. What are your, what is your quantum analysis at the macro level? Levels show you in terms of the pain that the US dollar rise this year is having on other currencies, especially big ones like the yen and also the pound at a record low versus a dollar. Yeah, absolutely. That's a very fair comment. And I think you are seeing that the stress and strains of the current global monetary policy tightening cycle is actually manifesting itself first and foremost in overseas markets, the strength of the dollar. It calls that 20 billion unilateral intervention from the Japanese and dollar yen a few weeks back. We've all seen the russians in sterling and guilt markets. Some of those have their own idiosyncratic flavours and they're in the case of the UK and the mini budget. But you can say that the reason we got here in the first place is being the strength of the dollar for the first nine months plus of 2022.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,26,2022-10-13 15:45:02
3218," in the case of the UK and the mini budget, but you can say that the reason we got here in the first place is being the strength of the dollar for the first nine months plus of 2022. The interesting thing from our modeling perspective to go back to your question is that for the first five, six months of the year, all the major FX crosses were very much macro plays. It was interest rate differentials. Sometimes it was nominal rate differential, sometimes a different cross mic feed more of real yield differentials, but it was very much about a hawkish fed and kind of outstripping its central bank peers. But a few months back, our model confidence was just captures how good a job macro is doing and was explaining price action in FX some to fall and fall aggressively. So the interpretation from our side has actually the last couple of months in the dollar rally has been less to do with fundamentals and actually more to do with non macro factors. And I suspect key amongst those is probably actually being trended momentum and its CTA flow just fought in the one way trend and pushing things higher more than it's been about macro. No, if that's a case and it's all about momentum, I'd say we're in for a ride because these things tend to go parabolic before they reverse. Hugh Roberts, quant insight head of analytics, really appreciate your insights here. Coming up, social insecurity benefits would jump at the start of the next year as a cost of living adjustment battles inflation. But are we getting the most out of the system? Our next guest has a few thoughts for you. Don't miss it. nasze ses Welcome back, Social Security Beneficiaries are looking at receiving higher payments as the Social Security Administration announces an 8.7% benefit increase for 2023. What does it all mean for your retirement? Joining us now is Jimmy Hopkins, Carson",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,27,2022-10-13 15:49:36
3219," Curity Administration announces an 8.7% benefit increase for 2023. 2023, what does it all mean for your retirement? Joining us now is Jimmy Hopkins, Carson Group Managing Partner of Wealth Solutions. So really big jump here. I'm guessing probably the biggest jump in a lot of our lifetimes, right? Yeah, it's the largest jump since 1981. So you might be able to tell if you can see me, but I actually was born right after that. So yeah, I have not seen one of these in my life and to put in perspective right 2020, we had about like a 1.3% increase. We had a couple years of zeros before. And I think everybody knows inflation's been high this last year and that's where the cola's coming from. Well, let me ask you because we've seen a lot of prices in the sub indices jump by a lot more than 8.5% we're talking about here, especially when it comes to rent and food at times. Is this enough? And how are people, how are retirees who are living off of their benefits, adjusting to this high inflation era? Yeah, and that's a great question. Now give a little bit of a positive spin on this. So we saw that number right and you see the CPI that most people see was about 8.2% here. And that's we track off of something called the CPI U for that main number of most people looking at. This actually comes from something called the CPI W. And that's actually up here at this 8.7%. So we actually saw a higher increase in the cost of living adjustments than the one on the chart right now that 8.2. And actually if you go look at there's another number called the CPI E, which actually tracks the spending of seniors. Now I have not seen the September data yet. I pulled it up this morning. They still only have August in there. But if you run that back August to August 21 to 22, that actually was about 7.7%. And so that's actually tracking what our seniors are spending. So the good news there is right now it looks like seniors are actually spending on items that are not seeing as high of inflation as a general population. So I'd say that's a good thing. Now the hard part is seniors live on more of a fixed income stream and those adjustments don't occur till next year. So they are trailing right now, right? The adjustment. And that's how Social Security always works. We adjust for the next year. So they're feeling it in their pockets today. And I have to imagine there might be some pent up purchases here for somebody living on a fixed income. Maybe they're staple items. Maybe they're things that they need. But also there could be some discretionary purchases. Given the length of time since we've seen anything happen like this before you were born looking good, by the way, I would ask do we have any idea where we could see some of this money end up in our current ecosystem, in terms of our current economy? Yeah, I think one of the things to think about right now is our people are going to start pushing off some spending. I was in an interview earlier today talking about holiday spending. And I think I saw about 14% of Americans that they already started back in August. They're trying to spend those expenditures out. I think that's something to pay attention to as we head into this holiday spending, we want to see this money being spent. We've got millions and millions of Americans that are impacted by Social Security. And it tends to provide people look at this as their income replacement, right? Their paycheck replacement. So a lot of people are using Social Security for those basic expenditures. And they're pulling from other things more as they're discretionary. So I don't know if this is going to have a direct impact right now. I think most people are still probably moving along, not adjusting their spending this year due to this COLA increase next year. But this is a serious thing. I mean, it is a good amount of money increase. If you think about it, I think it's 130 something dollars increase on average over the previous year. So more than a thousand dollars total next year that will be going out into our seniors pockets. But so flip side of that, this number also increases something called the taxable wage base. And so that went from I got 147, 147,000 to about 160,000. So that went up 13,000 dollars, which if you apply the 12.4% Social Security taxes to it for workers, that's about $1200 more in taxes that will pay next year for going into Social Security too. So we see an increase in benefits. We also see an increase on the flip side. And the taxes we will pay if you're earning that much money back into Social Security. But we appreciate your insights into this issue. Very near and dear to hearts of many in our audience, Jamie Hopkins, Carson Group Managing Partner of Wealth Solutions. Now for a random story of the day. And this one is a, it's a bit mind blowing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,28,2022-10-13 15:53:57
3220," Our audience, Jamie Hopkins, Carson Group Managing Partner of Well Solutions. Now for a random story of the day. And this one is a bit mind blowing here. Researchers at cortical labs have grown brain cells that have learned to play the video game PONG. The research team grew many human brain cells grown from stem cells and some from mouse embryos and connected it to the video game, the electrodes. Dr. Brett Kagan, who led the study says there are so many more research areas that can be explored in a comprehensive way and even plans to test the impact alcohol has on the many brains ability to play PONG. I'm calling this Pete, the Petri-Desh Pong player and I hope that we're going to have more of this. Now driving the development with the dream team, Japanese giants Honda and Sony. Now they are teaming up with something completely different here and Yahoo Finance is probably supermanian. I know you have the details of this for our audience. Now I might have got a bit distracted here with Pete talking about our Petri-Desh Pong player but this is an important development for the EV space. What are the details? Yeah you know Jared, it's Honda and Sony teaming up here. Maybe Sony is providing the brain cells if you will for this car. So essentially this is the IRA at work. They're going to actually make this Honda Sony car in Ohio, most likely in Ohio, Honda's plant there, taking advantage of the tax incentives and things like that to build this car. So we're going to see probably the full production model or a full mock up at CES this year. But big picture here is this is a car that's going to be powered by Sony's software entertainment services, even level for the autonomy and A-DAS type systems going to be powered by Sony and Honda will make the actual physical car itself for the batteries and the motor and the actual shell. And this thing with one of the big key features of this car is that it's going to be a premium sort of low volume car and Sony and Honda want to use subscription services software services to kind of make this recurring revenue streams that posted this one time, here's your money, give me the car. So they want to really focus on that subscription stuff offering as well. Another big part of it is that the industry wants to make fewer like new cars, right? They want to make fewer design, fewer shells and cars. They want to actually update the software, update componentry inside and that's the way they'll actually kind of make money. That's what Tesla does. I mean the model that's been offered over 10 years, that car's not going anyway. Anyway, going away anytime soon. It's more about the software and also upgrading the internal componentry and that's what Sony and Honda want to do here with this car. Hopefully we'll see you in January. And let me ask you along that vein. We saw a BMW roll out heated seats as a subscription service. That was not necessarily well received by the market. Lots of haters there that I saw on my Twitter feed. So there are some pitfalls to trying to get that recurring revenue. Are people becoming more acclimated to this? Where do you see this going? I think it's more along the lines of how we pay for apps on our phone. I think there's Sony seeing this car as almost like a big smartphone. It's a way for you to actually kind of add services like that and you might be willing to pay for a Spotify app or something like that monthly or one time basically. As opposed to like the physical features like heated seats that got a lot of blowback, BMW actually kind of backtracked that because it saw it as such. You're telling me you're building this actual feature in the car than not letting me have it. So you might have see stuff like autonomous features, things like that that you can actually add on a software and people might be okay with that as a subscription add on. Yeah, I can't wait until we get those subscription service where you don't have to keep the car itself. I think that's around the corner as well. Yeah, who finances, products who are median always appreciate you stopping by here. And let us call it turn around Thursday, stocks plunging 300 points and then reversing to the upside. Let's take a look on the Wi-Fi interactive before we go here and we are seeing green across the board, Russell 2000 and the Nasdaq, those are each up 1.51 percent, S&P 500, 100, up a little bit more and the Dow is leading the way. You can see it's up 1.86 percent for the four days in this week. Actually, we got to do three days. Forgot Monday was a holiday. We are seeing the Dow up 1.88 percent. Also taking a look at the bond market. See what's happening here. The 10 year yield, whoa, you know what? I got a surprise. I forgot. This popped up on my radar a little bit ago. It's just brands, the maker of Twinkie, ticker TWNK. That is at a record high. And I got to say, it has been making record highs many times this year as a lot of stocks have been faltering. So, hats off to the good folks at Twinkie. But I do want to get to some other sector action for today. Here's the Nasdaq 100. We can see Microsoft down 3 percent. In video, also down 3 percent. And then we can see the Nasdaq 100. And then we can see the Nasdaq 100. And then we can see the Nasdaq 100.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,29,2022-10-13 15:58:17
3221," But I do want to get to some other sector action for today. Here's a NASDAQ 100. We can see Microsoft down 3%, Nvidia also down 3%, Tesla up about 6%, 10% and I'm going to put a 1-year chart on. You can see we took out these lows here from May, June, July. It looks like we have risen back above and this isn't too dissimilar from some of the averages and the price action that we've been seeing in there. So is this a turnaround Thursday? I'll tell you what, when stocks go up on really bad news, could be the case. All right, we got one more thing to check here. I do want to check in on our leaderboard. Excuse me, I'm going to go back to the Wi-Fi Interactive. Regional banks taking the lead there up to 1.5% followed by stocks. That is a semiconductor insects and then that followed by gambling, value stocks, momentum. Momentum on a tarot here. I'm not going to delve into the irony there, but that is up about 1.5%. We're going to have to go, but we're going to be back in a little bit and I will be back Monday morning. You can catch me back. Goodbye. Multinational earnings could very well be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,30,2022-10-13 16:02:46
3222," our country revenues are generated overseas. So as we sort of think about the strength of the dollar overseas as well as the weakening economic backdrop, particularly in places like China and Europe, a lot of these multinational earnings could very well be coming under pressure through the third quarter. But currency markers, I think, are very much sniffing out this weak sort of global backdrop in this challenging environment that global central banks find themselves in, particularly with the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, on one end, particularly in the Bank of England, they're hiking interest rates to try to assert that stabilize their currency. While they're also, they're just finishing out buying bonds by the end of this week to try to stabilize the bond market, very, very difficult environment for global central banks to try and navigate. And so, certainly another layer of uncertainty and complication in the markets. And I do think this means that the dollar is probably going to remain pretty strong through the end of the year and into next year. As Julie mentioned at the top, we're going to be kicking off this earnings season, some of the banks were set to hear from them. And with that in mind, a lot of chatter around how strong the household balance sheet is. From your perspective and what you've been reading through, where are household balance sheets and especially going into next year, what is that kind of tenor of the consumer likely to be? I still think household balance sheets are in decent shape. I will acknowledge that we do anticipate another quarter of a build up in loan loss provisions across banks. This would be the sixth consecutive quarter that banks have decided to build up those loan loss reserves. And that is certainly going to act as a drag on overall bank earnings. And I think it's very much them being taking a slightly more conservative approach, just recognizing that, just about every analyst and market participant is calling for a recession sometime in 2023. And so I think banks really just want to fortify their balance sheets ahead of that. But when we look at the data today, we certainly acknowledge that consumers have been dipping into those pandemic-related savings. They've also been running up some of their credit card balances. But I would argue this is more of a normalization in credit card spending and usage, not necessarily a consumer that's becoming overextended. If you actually look at revolving credit as a percentage of disposable income, leading up into the pandemic, that number was sitting at around 6.5%. And now, after consumers decided to pay down some of those credit card balances over the course of the pandemic, that number has picked back up to around a 6% level. So we, and to add to that, we haven't necessarily seen consumer delinquency rates pick back up meaningfully. So I think today, consumers are still in a decent shape. Labor markets are still tight. Nominal wages are still strong. And that could certainly provide some support for consumers over the short term. But again, as businesses become a little bit more sour about the economic outlook, you'll start to see those hiring freezes, start to lead into job cuts and in layoffs. And then that's when the consumers really are going to start to come under pressure. Jordan, is the reality that the bear market is just not going to end until there is any whiff of a Fed pivot? To a certain extent, I think that's fair. And the reason why the pivot is so important is because there's still room for the Fed to actually be more hawkish. I know you've got the Fed that's settling a roughly 4.6% term right next year. But I think the real question is, when is the federal funds rate going across CPI? And I think it's going to cross sometime at the middle of next year. The challenge is I think it crosses out a higher Fed funds rate, not a lower inflation rate. And so I think the Fed and we'll get to submit sometime this afternoon, I think it's certainly going to continue to show that while some committee members are concerned about a slowdown in the economy, there's still laser focused on trying to bring that inflation and more importantly, maintaining that in their credibility as an inflation fighting entity. And so I think you do kind of have to see that Fed pivot because markets don't like higher rates. And the Fed may actually be in a position to do a little bit more over the course of the first half of next year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,31,2022-10-13 16:06:51
3223," you you mm ro you Pepsi co is the hottest ticker page on Yahoo Finance right now as the food giant way profit estimates and raised its full year forecast for sales and earnings. Joining us now is not other than PepsiCo Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnson. Who? Great to see you as always. You just got off the earnings call. I was on the earnings call as well. I think the street was very surprised by how strong your sales came in. Is this the reality that your business is still going to do pretty darn well even in a mild recession? Yeah, good morning. Nice to be with you guys. You know, I think it will historically we have done well as we've moved into recessions. Obviously, a 16% growth rate for PepsiCo is an extraordinary number. But that said, we do think that we'll continue to perform pretty well. Regardless of the economic environment, one of the beauties of consumer staples is, while people may trim their purchases in durables and more higher end goods. In a difficult environment, people want a bit of an affordable luxury and a bag of chips or a beverage is something that they can treat themselves well and give themselves a smile. So we should perform well through good and bad economy. I'm all for smiles, Hugh. Absolutely. Are you still pushing through price increases though in the fourth quarter? We did. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we took some more pricing. Again, all of that is based on commodity input costs, which continue to be higher. For the year, we'll be in the high teens in terms of our commodity input costs. So our pricing has been a little bit less than what we've experienced in inflation. But frankly, we focused on all the other aspects of our cost structure as well. So while gross margins were down a bit, operating margins were up as we've managed the balance of the cost structure very tightly. Hey, Hugh, it's Julie here. I just want to dig into pricing a little bit more. So average price is up 17% year over year. Average sales volume or overall sales volume, I should say, went down a little bit. How much are you going to be able to continue to raise prices? And do you expect volumes to continue to trend lower? It's a great question. We started the year with relatively high pricing, and we assumed that, in fact, volumes would do worse than what they have. Whole variety of reasons as to why that's the case, I think, for number one, prices are increasing everywhere, not just in our categories and in our company. Number two, household balance sheets for at least the upper eight deciles are still remarkably strong here in the United States. So as a result of that, we think we can continue to take whatever pricing we need to address the commodity inflation that has actually impacted us. In terms of that inflation, you guys know, and we've talked about in the past, we tend to forward buy on commodities about six to nine months. So as we see some moderation in commodities, we'll be able to manage our pricing going forward, but that's going to be a delayed effect because of our forward buying. What type of replenishment have you seen among your partners, your channel partners who are selling through so much of the inventory that you do produce, especially...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,32,2022-10-13 16:11:00
3224," because of our forward buying. What type of replenishment have you seen among your partners, your channel partners who are selling through so much of the inventory that you do produce, especially knowing that consumers who are looking for deals, they might be buying in bulk for some of the products that you offer that you bring to the market in order for themselves to be able to see some type of deal on their side. Yeah, it's less an issue for us than I think is elsewhere. Because our number one, our Southeast snack products have a limited shelf life. So you really can't buy too much in bulk on those products. And then on beverages as well, because our pricing tends to be relatively even. We used to do much more high low in terms of pricing. It's now a little bit more level. So the desire to sort of load in on those products when the prices are low, that opportunity doesn't exist anywhere. Candidately, we think that's better for the consumer. And what we've seen is consumers look at the category more favorably when the pricing is more consistent. So given that we control distribution all the way to the shelf for the majority of our products in a number of markets, that load in fact is really not an issue for us the way it might be for some other companies. Hugh, let's talk currencies for a moment. You guys say now the currency transition is going to cause about a two and a half percentage point hit to the top and bottom line for the full year. That's up a half a percentage point from previously. We've been watching all kinds of wacky currency moves, particularly when we talk about the British pound and the actions that the Bank of England are taking. I think you guys get about 2.5% of your sales from the UK if I'm not mistaken. How much of a problem are central banks? How much of a challenge I guess I'll ask that more diplomatically, is that posing for you in your business? I mean, currency whenever the dollar strong obviously impacts our international profits when we dollarized them. That said, at a two or two and a half percent level, we view it as relatively manageable. We don't hedge on translation of earnings. We only hedge transactions, frankly, because hedging translation doesn't create any real economic value. In fact, it has a cost to it, so it destroys economic value for shareholders. But at the level we're at right now, we view it as a manageable issue, not something that it's going to be disruptive. Hugh, you got some questions on the call about Gatorade. Early next year, I would say you're making a big push into caffeinated Gatorade via a product called Fast Twitch, I mean, 200 milligrams of caffeine. That's a lot of caffeine. How big a role do you think Gatorade will play in the entry drink market starting next year? Well, Gatorade broadly is doing really, really well right now. The base Gatorade, Gatorade zero is probably going to be a billion dollar business pretty soon. GFIT, the product that we introduced earlier this year is capturing occasions outside of the core sweat occasion for Gatorade. So we think that franchise is very extendable. One of the places we've seen athletes, and Brian, I suspect you probably use a product like this as well as athletes will use caffeine as a mechanism for driving performance. We viewed it as an opportunity. We certainly got requests for it from some of the professional teams that frankly use it as a performance assist as well. So we decided to launch the product and we think it's going to be a terrific product. How big it'll be? Hard to say at this point, but we do know there's a market out there. We're excited to participate in it. Well, we have you in the market that we see right now where evaluations have significantly lowered. Do you see more of an accelerated opportunity for deal making for looking at some of the brands that have looked kind of inquisitive or tasty, if you will, for a company in Pepsi and bringing them on board? Well, we've done a few deals over the past couple of years and obviously we like to spend the time to make sure that we integrate those deals properly in order to ensure we get the success we anticipated out of them. Look, the reality of it is we look at everything. Anything that's close to our space will always take a look at. At the same time, we're very, very disciplined in terms of the way that we approach actually executing a transaction. So I agree with the evaluations are down, but just sometimes something isn't inexpensive. It just costs less than it used to. All right. Wise words there. PepsiCo Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnson. Hugh, thanks as always for taking the time with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,33,2022-10-13 16:15:33
3225," Something isn't inexpensive. It just costs less than it used to. All right. Wise words there. PepsiCo Vice Chairman and CFO Hugh Johnson. Hugh, thanks as always for taking the time with us. Thank you. Good to be with you guys. The majority of bosses won employees back in the office full time. The new survey from five are found that 52% of employers want their workers back in person five days a week. But 42% of workers say they would consider quitting if that were the case. Five or CEO Micah Kaufman joined us now. Five or by the way, a platform for freelance workers. Micah, it's good to see you. So there's obviously tension here, right? There is this ongoing tension in the market. How do you think it ends up resolving itself? Thanks for having me on the show again. We're definitely seeing a very polarized view between managers and employees. And I think that if there's something very clear is that managers want this to be 2019 again. And employees cannot move back from having the experience of the past two or three years. And wanting to have more flexibility into the work, I think that some of that is going to be resolved. But the fact that those employees are actually going to leave. And I think in order to receive that level of flexibility, a lot of them are actually going to turn into freelancing, which allows them to define the level of flexibility that they're looking for. Okay, so that kind of answers or begins to answer my next question at least. Which is where would they go if they if they did leave? There are still for a lot of the companies that are either in a hybrid or purely virtual reality for their workplace and collaboration. There's still some of the hiring freezes that are in place. Some places looking at cutting and trimming their staff. So where would the opportunities be to still retain that virtual lifestyle, even if going to or looking for other employment opportunities? That's correct. I think that a lot of companies, those who are freezing or rethinking the way they want to employ talent are really making a shift between fixed expenses and variable expenses. And when you think about variable expenses, a lot of it is being answered by free answers. So a lot of the talent that are going to continue looking for that level of flexibility are going to turn into freelancing. And we're seeing very high levels of talent coming to us to five or in similar platforms to look for that level of flexibility. So, Michael, does that mean a recession would mean just a hiring boom for freelancers? I think that at some point, yes. Because again, I think that more and more companies are thinking about the shift between fixed and variable expenses. So obviously that is going to fuel. If you go back to the wake of the previous recession right around 2009, we've saw a boom in freelancing. We saw a boom in new business formation. And a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full-time employees. So they turn into platforms such as Fiverr to find the stun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,34,2022-10-13 16:19:34
3226," I'm saying we saw a boom in new business formation. And a lot of these businesses cannot actually afford full-time employees. So they turn into platforms such as Fiverr to find this talent. Mike, at this end, we've got now this proposal, although it's sort of vague on the part of the Biden administration to reclassify workers, which there's some thinking that it might eventually make some workers who are classified as freelance before us to come on the book's full-time. Any thoughts on that or the likelihood of that happening and the effect that that could have on your business? Yeah, I think that with the fact that freelancing is becoming a huge force in the workplace, statistics show that by the end of this decade, by 2030, 50% of talent is going to be engaging in freelancing in some form or the other. Policy makers are trying to figure out what to do with this huge cohort. And I think that in this space, we need to make a distinction between skilled and unskilled labor. So if you look at Fiverr as an example, on Fiverr, freelancers have total freedom regarding their work, what they offer when they offer it from where. So that level of freedom is something that is highly sought for, but it also comes with the price. I mean, you can't lead a totally free lifestyle and then expect to be considered to be a full-time employee. In other aspects of gig economy, maybe the situation is slightly different because they have less freedom on what they offer and how much they charge for it. This has been in the making for quite a long time and we're actually working close with policymakers to figure out how we can level the plain field for freelancers in aspects such as access to affordable medical insurance. But that's it, as I said, if you want to lead the lifestyle that allows you total freedom, you can't also expect to be considered as a full-time employee when you're not. Michael, just while we have you, over the past recessions where the gig economy roles have been available, we've seen this flow into some of the roles for freelancers or even just workers who are looking to take their own employment under their own control. For your business at Fiverr, given some of the investments that you've made into the business to try and unlock these larger projects, more engagement, what from the Fiverr perspective would you be looking towards to really navigate a recession as well yourself as a business? Yeah, so I think that a lot of businesses we've talked about fixed versus variable expenses, I think that a lot of businesses are actually focusing on identifying their core competencies and hiring full-time around those core competencies and looking for the more peripheral areas of expertise and turning into freelancers around those types of expertise. That could be if your core is technology, maybe something that is not in your core is going to be marketing or design in which cases they start to think about how to integrate freelancers into their workflows. This is why we've seen the appearance of the chief freelancer officer, which is a new role within companies, within HR, that thinks about how to integrate that level of talent into organizations. We're seeing that rising throughout the past few years and this is accelerating right now. Micah, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Micah Kaufman, who is Fiverr CEO. Appreciate it. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,35,2022-10-13 16:23:58
3227," you Chicago.ared ash. independent contractors to employees. Fox Advisors founder and CEO Steven Fox joins us now for some analysis on this. Steven, has this now been priced in any potential change that may come in the first half of next year? It isn't now fully priced into these stocks. You know, actually I think it's more than priced into this stock. I think regulatory concerns have been sort of the hand-ranging events since these companies were public. And what we've seen is that the companies have been able to manage through these events and actually continue to improve their business model. So I think it's being overdone at this point. Lift has said nothing is immediately going to change about its business model just yet. Of course, that's what the company would say. Given the fact that, yeah, there's still a lot of discussion that has to take place in the near term in order to see any type of reclassification go forward. But what extent should customers at the end of the day, if this does move forward, expect their prices, their fares to also have to be adjusted? Yeah, that's a great point because all the companies obviously could still raise prices to offset any higher costs. I think it's also important to keep in mind that what happens at the federal level is independent of what happens at the state level. So companies have been in discussions with various states. I think the most encouraging thing you saw without out of the state of Washington this year, which signed into law in an independent contractor plus agreement, which basically allows for some benefits, sort of this IC plus gives the driver's flexibility plus benefits and the companies are working to pass those costs through to customers and also reducing other costs tied to other pieces of the business to offset some higher costs as well. Steven, as we potentially go into a recession, what effect will that have on the sort of driver service dynamic? In other words, could there potentially be more people who are available to be drivers? Unfortunately, if they're a layoffs or, you know, does Dubra lift get away with paying them less? Like, how is, what are gonna be all those knock on effects? Yeah, I don't think Uber and lift get away with paying them less, especially in this political environment. And I don't think they're looking to pay them less. I think if you go back and look at what the companies have had done, forget about what they've said, but what they've done for their drivers specifically over the last couple of years, they've worked to make their expenses come down through various methods. They've also worked to make their time on the network much more efficient. Obviously, if they're sitting around waiting for a ride, it's not as efficient. So it's really important to step back and say, okay, in a weaker economy, how dependent it has, the consumer become on these rideshare opportunities, whether to drive or also to ride, and how do the network utilization rates look? On top of that, you know, the real on-tap market is still the enterprise. So large companies with multiple pockets of spending on transportation and food delivery, as they consolidate those things, those are real profitable opportunities for lift and uber that they can also translate into their drivers to make money. Right, a lot of focus on driver utilization to make it more incentivized in order for drivers to actually want to be on the platform and be able to take advantage of more rides. But then there's also the thought of if this goes through and that changes the classification, does that actually make it more intriguing for new drivers to sign up and increase the supply side of this broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major kind of, a major delta on prices here for consumers. Yeah, so one time has that much energy and substance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,36,2022-10-13 16:28:31
3228," broader kind of supply demand equation that ultimately has a major kind of a major delta on prices here for consumers. Yeah, so one of the interesting things that I think Wall Street doesn't appreciate enough is that when you talk about these networks, the companies aren't playing checkers, it's more like three-dimensional chess. So when you look at supply versus demand, like take the UK for instance where Uber is now providing benefits to the drivers while giving them flexibility, they're cost of going up, but then other costs have gone down in terms of actually providing, you know, looking at driver incentives for example, they don't have to provide as many. And so they're attracting probably more drivers now passing on some of the cost of the customers, but competition has followed. So you're getting a little bit of that network benefit I think. How it plays out in the US is going to be on a region by a region basis. But generally speaking, I think the companies have the way to manage through this and continue to march towards evict doggles where they've been set, like at Lyft and Uber. Thanks, advisors founder and CEO Stephen Fox. Early this week the Board of Directors officially approved XPO logistics plan separation of its freight brokerage business. The company also named a new CFO. I had the chance to speak to the company's current CEO and founder Brad Jacobs about the restructuring at the company. I'm here at the Greenwich Economic Forum with Brad Jacobs, the founder and CEO of XPO logistics, although not much longer. Brad is great to see you in person. And I say not much longer of course because the company is spinning off RxO which is logistics business, you just announced what that's effective on November 1st I believe. So talk to me about what's happening now, what the process feels like and what investors can expect from the two companies. It's very exciting. After 10 months of working really hard with large number of people working long hours, we're this close to the spin and we'll create two separate companies that will be an inch wide and a mile deep in what they do. And therefore they're likely to do it much better. So we'll have a pure play less than truck load business. That'll be XPO and we'll have a pure play non-asset truck brokerage business called RxO which is best in class truck broker. So it's very exciting. And you're not going to be running the day-to-day business any longer. That's correct. Do you have some plans yet for what the next thing, the next Brad Jacobs chapter is going to be yet? Well, I want to try to repeat what I've done before which is to have companies that over a 10-year period or so create at least 10 times return on the initial capital. And so I'm not a private equity firm in trying to make two or three X and let's not make any. I go for things that are 20X, 30X, the big ones. So I'm looking for that. I'm looking for the next big thing. And where any hints of what in what industry or where you think the opportunities are, because especially right now, it's tricky time, right? It's the best time to start a business when valuations are low and it's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about what they're doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,37,2022-10-13 16:32:39
3229," time, just start a business when valuations are low and it's fear out there and there's not a lot of competition because a lot of people are nervous about not being courageous because they're nervous about where the economy is going and so forth. That's when you want to get it. That's when you want to buy. When valuations are reasonable and there's not a lot of competition, but I don't know. I'm still gainfully employed at CEO for a few more weeks. Sorry to get you to, don't mean to get you to jump ahead too soon. But let's talk a little bit more about the environment. You and I were just talking before now about all of the negativity that we're hearing, right? From Redalio to Jamie Dimon, the IMF cutting, it's GDP forecast. Well, to the Jones and Holy. Yeah, all of it. I mean, you have a really good figure on the pulse of what's going on in the economy because of moving things around. So what do you see? So I don't always get it right. I often get it right, but not half a hundred percent of the time. My take is we're probably, so when you see all these really great minds, they'll come out and universally say, oh, it's really bad coming up. That's usually historically been the final pre-capitulation phase. So everyone agrees that, oh, it's really bad. And then you have the final plunge. That's the time to buy. When everybody says, oh, it's down this, it's going to keep going down more. That's the time to do it. So I'm really having my antennas up for it because I don't think, I don't think this downturn, which is likely to happen, is going to last for a long time. And there's, don't forget, there's two things. The economy and there's the market. Yes. And the market is usually a couple quarters ahead of the economy. Right. So we could see, so the capitulation you're talking about is the market. In the market. Yes. The economy might lag that. Yeah, economy could lag. Could as the straights go up as quantitative tightening gets tighter, you could see as a significant slowing in the economy. But the world has become such a small world and so well informed. And so many people understand economics now. It didn't turn the great financial crisis. I don't think it'll last long. I think there'll be such pressure to, okay, now we reduced inflation. Okay, now let's get some growth going again. I don't expect a long, long downturn. I expect a short, maybe significant downturn. Now, one of the things that was a detail in the latest jobs report made me think of you. And that had to do with trucker jobs, which fell by 11,000 in the month of September. And I'm just curious what that tells us. The number of truckers hired, I should say, fell by 11,000. Well, a metric that we watch very closely, Julie, is for every truck job, truck driver posting that we post, how many people apply for it? That's about 45% just in the last several months. So there's a lot more people coming back into the job market as the economy gets a little tougher. So there's the pendulum is swinging on that. Don't get me wrong. It's still very tough to hire truck drivers. It's a lot less tough than it was even a few months ago. The inventory climbs that we are seeing, by a lot of not just the retailers, but in other industries as well. How is that affecting your business and the loads of things that you guys are trucking around? Well, the transportation business does better. The industry is a whole when inventory is a low, not high. There's more restocking and there's more goods being moved. But what you see right now is really interesting. As a result of all the craziness of the pandemic, people got the wrong, they have a lot of inventory, but it's often the wrong inventory. They have too much of this and too little of that. So there's still a lot of activity. So goods are still flowing. Goods are still flowing, but not as much as more. Not as much. Yeah. But it's an interesting dichotomy. You observe the same thing I observed today at the Greenwich Economic Forum. It's pretty downbeat. It's pretty dire. People have their their warrior face design. When you talk to my echo chambers a little bit different, my echo chamber is CEOs of large companies, chief supply chain offices, large companies, entrepreneurs of small businesses who need their goods move. And they're not as negative. They're not as positive as they were say a year ago. They're less positive, but they're generally growing. They're not contracting. They're just growing less. All right, I have one final fun question for you. The Tesla semi. How much is that going to change the trucking industry? It depends on the price point. So we're a partner to one of the big OEMs for their electric vehicle, uh, semis. And actually we call them semi. The semi. The semi conductor. The semi conductor. And we call them semi. Sorry. No ring. Sorry. But the. The.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,38,2022-10-13 16:37:14
3230," uh... semis and actually we call them semi-semis semi-semis semis and semis and semis and semis are no we don't but the the semis are they're beautiful and the truckers love them and they're slick and they're well-designed they accelerate fast and are safe and they've all kinds of gizmos in them but they're really expensive and so that the economics aren't there yet now if the economic if the technology advances in the manufacturing process advances such that they become cost effective yet very transformative make sense alright bad jake up so vexfield thank you so much it was great to see you in person really appreciate it thanks so it was fun there because brad was sort of an antidote to a lot of the darkness i mean he you know he's not saying everything is wonkydorian fantastic but part of it is the force of his personality part of it is what he's seen on the ground he he was a little bit of a counterbalance to some of the worst case scenarios that we're hearing out there you say tomato i say tomato yeah i think that's it's interesting to what he said though about the uh... the tesla uh... semi truck it's going to be fascinating when those trucks eventually hit the road because at some point it sets a stage for driverless semi trucks in this country yes but as he said the price has to come down to make sense which makes sense right also critical time for the business given the spin-off that's moving forward and drew wilkerson is going to be the new CEO of that spin-off and he had even in this most recent earnings period talked about how the company has a long track record of growing gross profit even through economic cycles and they're confident right now they're going to continue to do that i for one can't wait to see what brad is going to next the next thing he's going to tackle it's tough to see him leave this industry he is this industry that you podcast. We'll quick check on the commodity space right now and looking specifically at oil. We are seeing both WTI crude and Brent crude to the downside. WTI down about more than 2% Brent crude down about 1.9 there. For more on the commodity space, let's bring in Suki Cooper, a stand chart executive director and precious metals analyst. Suki, good to talk to you. You've specifically been looking at gold right now. Sort of what has traditionally been more of a safe haven play, but it sounds like you think there's more downside to comp. Gold has really been caught in the headwinds of the strength of the dollar and the scope for further rate hikes. And while we think that the Fed is not done with its rate hikes, I think there's another 75 basis points that's likely to come in an November meeting and another further 50 basis points in December, we think these are going to present strong headwinds for the gold market. But we do think that the downside is quite well supported. We're seeing quite a good price elastic response in terms of demand from India and China. And there's still that concern around the session risk and perhaps the need for flight to safety that is buffering some of the downside for gold. But we do think that there's more downside risk to come as the year comes to an end and into 2023. We see gold prices heading further towards 1600 towards the end of next year. So 1600, we're at 1675 right now. Is 1600 the support level you're talking about? The case pool.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,39,2022-10-13 16:41:24
3231," the toward 1600 towards the end of next year. So 1600 we're at 1675 right now, a 1600 the support level you're talking about? The key support that's coming up next is around 1650. So this is a level that we've seen physical demand materialising and now we're entering a period where we tend to see seasonal demand from India, Diwali falls in the 24th this month, we have the wedding season as well. And we've seen in markets like China, the physical premium earlier last month's long to levels that we last saw in 2015. So that price drop that we initially saw below 1700 was greeted by quite strong physical interest in the gold market. So the next level to look at from here will be 1650 and then beyond that is 1600. If we breach those two levels, then we're really looking to the cost of production on where that provides a guideline and for the gold market. And we tend to see in a longer and basis and here I'm looking at around about 40 years that gold prices tend to trade a third above the average cost of production. And that guideline suggests to us around 1550 to 1600 is where that floor from the production side should materialise. So much of the price moves as you point out really driven by the stronger dollar and we have seen it climb up again today looking at something like the Japanese yen well above or below depending on how you look at it, those intervention levels. I mean how much higher do you think the green bag goes as you track those metals and moving in tandem? It's really pivotal for the communist complex as a whole. The dollar strength has been a headwind for not just gold but for silver, platinum and playdium. It's really damp and that upside risk. We think that there's likely that we may see further dollar strength and perhaps we'll see something of a stabilization coming in the first part of next year and that's really when we might see some of that pressure on gold prices starting to ease. But if we look at the correlations for the gold markets, its strongest consistent relationships since the start of this year has been with the US dollar. That correlations jump in above 60% at the moment but last year that relationship had started to pivot towards real yields and nominal yields. That relationship still matters for gold. It's in close second but at the moment it's the strength of the dollar that's proven to be a key headwind. Now it's not to say that gold can't rise if we see dollar strength. If both dollar and gold are benefiting from safe haven demand, we can see them both rally. But in the current environment, it's the concerns around slowing demand over the longer term but there's also concerns around higher rates that's really weighing on gold and it's not benefiting from safe haven demand at the moment. So bottom line Tsukiya, you should investors be putting their money here or is there a better value in the precious metals space? If we look at the entire complex on a longer term basis, the industry bias precious metals fundamentals are set to tighten. If we look at markets like Plastinum and Pladium, we think that towards the end of this year we're going to see much tighter markets. As the auto markets start to recover, we were anticipating at the start of this year a rebound around about 11% in global auto production but we've scaled back our expectations closer to 7%. But into 2023 we're still expecting the double-digit rebounds in terms of global auto production and PGMs are critical in terms of growth that we see in the auto industry. So those are two markets where we expect in more off-sider risk towards the end of this year but on a longer term horizon, perhaps silver is the metal where we might see more off-sider risk and given the demand from the solar energy given the electrification of vehicles, this is strong growth that we're likely to see but that demand is like to take two to three years to materialize. So over the longer-run silver has positive prospects but in over the next few months we think there's more upside risk for Plastinum and Pladium at least in the short term. Sookie Cooper, Stan Chard, Executive Director and Precious Metals, analysts, good to have you on today. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,40,2022-10-13 16:45:49
3232," you We're taking with the ESG investing theme here a new study by PwC found that nearly nine and ten institutional investors believe that asset managers should be more proactive in developing new ESG products but fewer than half of asset managers were planning to launch new ESG funds. So what's an investor to do? Joining us now is Bruce Usher a Columbia Business School professor an author of the new book investing in the era of climate change and Bruce you've been arguing that despite the economic backdrop this is kind of the time to be investing in some of these green names. Walk me through that thesis. It's really about the macro trends climate change. We know climate signs. We know that after 300 years of building a global economy that's putting emissions into the atmosphere. We've got 30 years to decarbonize to avoid catastrophic climate change. So you've got consumers pushing to buy more sustainable goods. You've got employees saying they want to work for sustainable companies. You now have investors looking at those trends. Company leaders saying we need to meet those trends. You have government action like the global risks of climate change manifesting themselves. More violent storms, heat waves. So all these macro trends are all pushing the same direction. They're going to be with us for decades to come. How do you break that down though for investors who are looking at this and saying well okay there's questions about yes she funds and we'll get into that in just a bit. But in terms of the names there's you know EVs which some would argue that that's actually not a long term play in terms of impact on climate change. So when I looked at this sector 20 years ago, how long I've been in it. The big challenge then was there was nothing to invest in. If you look at the whole solar power market everything globally does less solar than one coal plant. Last year the investment solar more than 100 coal plants worth and gaining. So the big picture here is that the opportunity to invest is now trillion dollar sectors. We've got the EV sector. All the automakers are going EVs. The key question is why? The reason is that those products are better than the incumbent product there's other before. So you look at EVs specifically suggest that why the EV sales so good because consumers love them. Consumers prefer EV products that flying out the showrooms in fact the car makers can't keep up with them. They prefer the products but it's still a very small portion right we're talking roughly what 5%? What 5%? But now analysis has shown that around 5% you get a tipping point in these markets. And that's what the automakers are seeing. You have to ask why they all rush into this market. What they see is 5 years ahead. When they're planning new cars they're looking 5 years in the future that's how long it takes to roll it in a model. And what they see is an all-the-evee future because it's a better product, consumers like it and then we have these trends around climate change. So that's what's really pushing that and that's what's creating the investment opportunities. When consumers and businesses go in this direction the market opens up to investors. We have seen incredible amount of inflows into ESG funds over the last few years. A bit of a reckoning so we'll argue that's happening right now not just this being politicized but you've also got those like Deutsche Bank some other names who are now being called out for greenwashing the funds that the names that were included in these funds were not necessarily sort of green so to speak. What do you think? I mean what do you think is happening here? How does this manifest itself from an investor perspective? Those who've been putting money behind these saying they were anticipating some impact coming from these funds well turns out that's not actually what ESG investing is. That's correct, exactly. And there's a real misunderstanding around ESG. ESG investing is really very simple. It's saying look when I look at potentially investing in assets I look at financial numbers, I look at management, I look at all these things and then also to be a smarter investor what else could this investment at risk?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,41,2022-10-13 16:50:06
3233," It's saying, look, when I look at potentially investing in assets, I look at financial numbers, I look at management, I look at all these things. And then also, to be a smarter investor, what else could put this investment at risk? What else could change the outcomes? Look at risks like flooding or hurricanes or wildfires. How could that affect my investment? If you wouldn't go out by a house, a second home on the coast, would you want to know if it's going to flood? Would you want to know that? That'd be a smart thing to know. That's what ESG investing is. It can make you a better business manager. It can make you a better investor. The challenge, though, is it doesn't really address climate change. Just because you're deciding on a walk away from that house, I'm going to pay less for it because it's at flood risk, that doesn't reduce the risk of flooding. That's the challenge. So how do you invest from an impact standpoint? So from impact standpoint, it's much more important that you go beyond ESG investing. And there's really two strategies that I write about my book. One is what we call thematic. So pick a theme that you're excited about your comfort with. If you're really interested in renewable energy, invest in the solar or wind fund. There's plenty of those out there. That's a way to really channel money into a solution. Or if you're interested in EVs, into IBV company stocks, or funds, those are thematic funds. There's also now new funds coming out in green hydrogen, other leading technologies. So you can have a thematic focus, equity, debt, venture capital, as you wish. Or you can have what we call impact first focus. So this is very special in the sense that it's really only for high net worth investors. Impact first is not falling if I do share responsibility. It's saying, I really want to dress climate change. I'm going to put my capital into that. I might get a return. The return might be decades from now. But it's going to have great impact. And that's where you're really investing in technologies. Aren't you commercial? This goes well beyond say solar and EVs. This is some new technologies like direct air capture, for example. And really quickly, what about green bonds? So green bonds are issued by companies because they see these trends coming. They see these sustainability trends, consumers want it, investors want it. It's again thinking about how is how is they will be carbonizing and what does that mean for my business. The green bond makes perfect sense. But again, a green bond is not going to have tremendous impact on the environment. It's just a very sensible investment. Okay. Good to differentiate those two. Bruce Astro, Columbia Business School professor and author of the book, Investing in the era of climate change. Thanks for joining us today. Thank you. All right. Let's take a look at United shares up just around one and a half percent. Who does this work? Hong Kong waxes. Good afternoon. That was my welcome. I look forward to it But I'm still have other about30 to 30. New velocity. lifting its third quarter guidance. It looks like demand is very strong amongst the airlines. What's your assessment? Yeah, thanks for having me. So a couple of things. Number one, yes, you're right, demand, especially for international is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international and mostly international leisure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,42,2022-10-13 16:54:42
3234," National is very strong. We've seen a shift in mix in the last couple of months from domestic leisure to international and mostly international leisure. And I think that's somewhat behind the United decision to add more leisure international destinations for next summer. We did a preview on Friday for the earnings season and we said we thought American Delta United had the best opportunity for positive surprise because we've gone from the first say four months of the year when we saw international down something around 60 percent, 50 to 60 percent from 2019 levels and now we're down closer to 15, 155 percent. So you've seen that big increase as markets have opened up. People have shifted and started flying further, especially Transatlantic, not so much Trans-Pacific but Transatlantic. And business we've gone from being down about 40 or 50 percent earlier in the year to being down 25 percent earlier in the year. So I think those two elements and we've still seen strong domestic leisure but instead of being up 30, 35 percent, it's up closer to 10 percent, 15 percent. So you've seen that mix shift which has huge positive implications for revenue and I think the Delta reports tomorrow first, you just mentioned that and I think you'll you'll hear them talk about that for the rest of the quarter and or the rest of the current quarter, yeah, fourth quarter. And I know obviously the industry still dealing with some of these staffing shortages as well. How is this affecting some of the more profitable routes for these airlines? I'm sorry, I missed the first half. They're doing more of these what as well. As we're still seeing some issues when it comes to things like labor shortages and we continue to see some of these kinks getting worked out. How is this affecting some of the most profitable routes? Yeah, so we're having these issues with to your point with respect to infrastructure. So it's not just labor, it's air traffic control, it's airport infrastructure. I don't know when you flew last but I was at airport, so it was to airport yesterday and the day before and stores are closed, they haven't reopened, they can't find people. And we're seeing a lot of that and and so that's going to inform growth for for 2023 and probably 2024. And not only that, you didn't specifically ask about this but the OEMs are behind on deliveries so their airlines don't have the and they don't know when they're getting the aircraft. So from an airline perspective, it's really hard for network planning to think about where they're going to grow and where these aircraft are going to go and not knowing whether you're even going to have the aircraft. United is in a really unique position because they didn't retire a lot, they didn't retire any as a matter of fact of their wide body aircraft during the pandemic. So they are in a really great position to be able to shift capacity around their network and grow into some of these domestic leisure markets. That's part of why we have United rated and outperform and the others retire their aircraft and in part they were older so it made sense to retire them but they're having issues because the OEMs are behind on deliveries or having issues getting our aircraft to be able to grow, grow going going forward. So we think we'll probably talk a lot about that too. Yeah, Holly, you mentioned the supply chain issues, the volatile jet fuel prices, difficulty hiring and retaining employees. A lot of this focus is going to be on how exactly these airlines are going to rain in costs at this time. What do you want to hear? What do you expect to hear over the coming weeks? Yeah, so the first thing I'd love to hear from them is labor contracts. Every, the big four airlines have open pilot contracts. American has an open flight to tenant contract. I would love to hear them talk about there. They probably won't because they don't like to talk about open labor contracts on earnings calls, but I would love it if they could give us some confidence that maybe by next summer a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great both from an investor perspective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,43,2022-10-13 16:58:39
3235," give us some confidence that maybe by next summer a lot of these contracts would be negotiated and ratified. That would be great both from an investor perspective and from an employee perspective. I think it would be nice. If the pilots, the flight attendants knew what they were going to be earning and I think that would be good to get that resolved. We also, as you mentioned earlier, we need to attract people to the profession. I mean, we can't just do it overnight. We need to start with young people, younger people. But yes, I'd love to hear that. I think we're going to hear a lot of discussion about their loyalty programs. The number one credit card that everybody has that Americans mostly have, anyway, is a cashback card and then that's usually followed by a gas card. But if you live in a hub city, you probably have an airline card and your spend is probably high and you, but it takes a while to earn a free ticket or an upgrade. So the airlines like having that dollar today because it's not going to be redeemed for months yet and it definitely helps. But if there's the shift in mix to more leisure-oriented travel from business and corporate travel, that's going to inform the way the airlines think about loyalty going forward. So I'd love to hear them talk a little bit about that. Demand for the holiday season. I'm starting to hear from people that fairs are getting a little out of control and so they're driving versus flying. I feel like everybody goes home for Christmas, but not everybody goes home for Thanksgiving. And in my investor calls lately, I've been hearing people echoing that and saying, we're driving this year for Thanksgiving or we're doing Thanksgiving at our house this year. We're not going. We have to buy four tickets, five tickets, whatever. It's just gone really aggressive. Especially given how far fairs have come in the last, say, 18 months because obviously in the worst part of the pandemic, the airlines were discounting and in the last six or nine months, they've been raising fairs pretty aggressively in part to cover higher costs. But in part to discourage some demand. But yeah, flights are full. They're like 90 percent. Well, they're more there. They're almost always going out with very few free available seats. Certainly airlines and flyers as well, having to be more strategic at the moment. A big thank you to Helena and Becca for joining us this afternoon. Thank you. In this episode of Influencers, Marty Walsh, US Secretary of Labor. The biggest question we have is getting people back to work in the labor market. I mean, lots of jobs still open in the country. So we have some work to do here at the Department of Labor. It's no secret. I'm a union guy. I have a union book in my pocket, but I represent all workers in America. What's happening is we're still living in COVID. We're still living in the pandemic and the pandemic's not gone. So they're still fear out. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Influencers. I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to our guest, US Labor Secretary Martin Walsh. We're here in front of the Labor Department in Washington, DC. Thank you very much for having us, Secretary Walsh. Thanks for having me today on this nice cool day in Washington. It is a bit brisk, but you're used to that being from Boston, right? Yeah, not too bad. Yeah, it's a lot colder in Boston today. That's right. So I want to jump right in and ask you about the labor market. Jobs report the other day a little bit weaker than expected in terms of creation, but the unemployment rate below 4%. That's good news. But I want to ask you what you're most concerned about when it comes to the labor market in the United States right now? Well, I think obviously the biggest question we have is getting people back to work in the labor market. I mean, lots of jobs still open in the country. So we have some work to do here at the Department of Labor and in working about retraining workers in new skills, for new opportunities that they left their previous job for. They haven't gone back to a job. I think that that's one thing that we have to do a better job of. And that meaning by that when I say better jobs, such as the federal government's working with states.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,44,2022-10-13 17:03:05
3236," They left their previous job for they haven't gone back to a job. I think that that's one thing that we have to do a better job of. And that meaning by that when I say a better job, it's not just the federal government's working with states and cities to create opportunities. You know, I'm a former mayor so we did a lot of job training in the city of Boston. And I did a lot of work of attracting new companies to Boston because we had workforce there that could do the job. So I think we're in a very different situation right now. This isn't about attracting new companies and filling those jobs. This is about filling jobs that remain open. So 2022, that's going to be, we've done in 2021, 2022, the present has tasked us with that priority of making sure that we get as much job training out there that's going to get real impact and get people back to work. What about black Americans, though, Secretary Walsh? The numbers were a little bit weaker there for that particular group. Is that a concern for you? Yeah, we have to be a lot more intentional when it comes to black Americans. Historically, the unemployment rate for black Americans is often double out of white Americans. But if you dive, you have in deeper and some of the jobs that black Americans have, you know, high paying jobs. So we have to create better pathways. And I think that we have to do, you know, myself and I've been partnering with Secretary Gidona from Education and Secretary Mondo from Commerce and working to how do we create better pathways, whether it's out of high school, into community college, college, working with businesses, working with labor, moving forward. So we have to do, we have to be more intentional about our work there. Some places have done a really good job of it down in Atlanta. I've done some good work on it. But there's not enough of those stories around America yet. Another area just to dive in a little bit into the market is restaurants leisure and that sector of the economy, which has just been whipsawed, obviously, by COVID, are the steps you can take there? Well, it's a little different. I mean, we did see some of the largest gains in employment in those areas, but there's still a lot of openings in those areas. And I think that the issue of restwares restaurants have, it goes a lot deeper than just hiring. It goes with the COVID implications with shutting down, having to go to take out, having a remote, having to build barriers in their restaurants. So, you know, again, a lot of restaurants have done, people have said to me in the beginning of the pandemic when I started this job here at Secretary Labour, that the unemployment benefit was keeping people from going to work. And quite honestly, when the unemployment benefit expired, people still didn't go back in some of those industries. So again, I think those industries are reimagining how do they hire people, how do they get more people engaged in coming into work in those places. And I do feel that they will come back. The pandemic, you know, we have these conversations all day long about, what do you think is going on in the economy? What's happening? What's happening is we're still living in COVID. We're still living in the pandemic. And the pandemic's not gone. So, there's still fear out there. There's still lack of child care out there. There's still concern about people going working with the public. So, all those challenges we move forward here, as we get more people vaccinated, and we do a better job of testing, I think more people feel comfortable going back to work. Another faster the economy that has caught a lot of people's attention lately is inflation. And we just saw that record number come out, or 40 year high, I should say, 7% the other day. And I'm wondering how that's impacting the labor market. Well, certainly when you think about that number that came out the other day, it's not something that I want to talk about. We want to see it go the other way and see more people going to work. But I think we have to look at it through the lens of the whole picture. And we look at what's happened in 2021 with President Biden after he took over, putting out the vaccines getting Americans vaccinated. 81% of the think of all adults are vaccinated out in our country. 6.2 million new jobs, 3.9% unemployment number, 84% of the industries that were affected by the pandemic, people gone back to work, we're seeing lows in highs in job creation and lows in unemployment benefit, so the other biggest decreases. So those are all positive signs. And then we also have to do some more work. We have to make sure we continue through President Biden's economic plan to work on the issues of lowering inflation, bringing forward the experts and the economists saying by the end of the year, we'll see that number tactical the other way, which is a good sign, but that doesn't help anyone today. So President is making sure that the impact he has is going to have a big impact at the kitchen table. And you mentioned the vaccines and I want to talk about vaccine mandate of course and ask you about enforcement, obviously still in front of the Supreme Court. But where do things stand in terms of administration forcing that with the companies right now? Well, I don't think you have to force a company. I think most companies have stepped up, but it is, ultimately it's going to be the responsibility of employers making sure their employees are safe, making sure that the workplace is safe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,45,2022-10-13 17:07:45
3237," I don't think you have the force of companies. I think most companies have stepped up, but it is, ultimately, it's going to be the responsibility of employers making sure their employees are safe, making sure that the workplace is safe, making sure they have the proper PPE and social distancing, if you will, inside their establishments, a little trickier when it comes to production lines and things like that where people are working close, tight quarters. But I think at the end of the day, regardless, in favor of the Department of Labor, medical experts have said that this is the right thing to do. People have said this is the right way to go. We should be doing this. Many companies support us, but even with or without what the ETS says, it's still the responsibility to work with employers to make sure that workplace are safe for their workers. Do you have a plan if the Supreme Court strikes it down? The plan is that we're going to be asking employers to continue to make sure that workplace are safe. We're doing that before. I think that I've spent the last couple of weeks here talking to some of the largest employers in the country. We talked about vaccine programs they have. All of these companies have programs set up in them already. They've already thought about this. They've thought about this from probably mid-2020 to today to make sure they create a safe space for their employees. Number one, to keep them safe. But also number two, to create an environment that people want to come back to work. Secretary Walsh, aren't there problems with enforcement given the shortages of test kits? And what is the administration doing there to make that happen? Well, obviously there's issues around right now and supply getting more test kits made. And the ETS, if it's passed or within the effect now, but if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Department of Labor, the testing is going to be for those that are unvaccinated. So that's a lot smaller number than people that are vaccinated. I want to shift gears and ask about some labor and negotiations and strikes around the country. In March, there was a union drive at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama and President Biden called for no intimidation. The federal agency has found that Amazon did legally intimidate workers during the union driver. You disappointed that Amazon defied the president's words? Well, there's going to be another vote there. I don't know if the data's set yet, but I saw that the other day. There's going to be another vote there in that. So there'll be an opportunity for the employees to see if they want to unionize there. Certainly the president's feeling, my feeling is everyone has the right to organize. And they should be able to organize without any interference. And I think that that's for any company in America. Same with Starbucks. There's a lot more unionization going on with those stores. Is that surprised you? Not really. You know, when you look at the numbers, what's surprising is the polling number is 70% of millennials feel they look very favorably upon unions. And when I say surprise, I'm happy to see that. I grew up in a labor family and as a kid, you know, not everyone had the same feeling. And my family, my father and myself, my uncle, and my brother and cousins who felt that way. So it's good to see that there is definitely an interest in unionization again. Union's bring opportunities for people in this country that otherwise wouldn't have the power of cut to bargaining, the power of fighting for raising their wages, the power of pensions, the power of other people. And the power of other kind of pension plans for one case. So I think that there's opportunities here for us to rebuild the middle class by that. And certainly I support collective bargaining and I support unionization. But I also support it being done the right way. So if people want to organize, they should be able to organize. And if people choose not to organize, they should have that right as well. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,46,2022-10-13 17:11:46

3239," a post office. You used to be a well sought after job. I think it still is. I mean good benefits and things like that. But again, I think that this pandemic, you know, I think we all, I don't know if happened to you, happened to me. We had an opportunity to have a lot of downtime thinking about, you know, I was the mayor of Boston when it began. And you know, I went to work every day, but I'd be home at five o'clock that never happens as mayor. And you'd have a lot of time to think about where you are in society, where you are in your job. And people took that time and had a lot of good quality, family time, saying wait a second, I want something different. Let me ask you about Proposition 22 in California, which is a really interesting and critical issue about gig workers and whether or not their employees. Where do things stand with that? You know, what we're focused on here is on misclassification of employees right now, looking at who's being misclassified and the severity of misclassification. When people are misclassified, they lose out on wages, they lose on the benefits, they lose on the protections, they lose out on a whole bunch of different things. And, you know, some of those misclassification that we look at, people like dishwashers, everyone thinks of Uber and Lyft as gig working, but some of it's also misclassification of dishwashers in restaurants. So, you know, we're working through a process here and we're looking at making sure that workers have their rights, that the rights that are owed to them. In October, you visited Striking Kellogg's workers. And I'm wondering, how do you make the decision when to visit Striking Workers or not? Well, I can't visit every strike in place in the country, but generally when I go there, if I go to a strike, it's to support workers, but it's also to create and open to a pathway. I'm willing to step into any negotiation, leaving negotiation that's needed in this country to solve it. If workers are on the street striking, that means that the problem, that's a problem for the company, it's a problem for the workers. The workers make any money and the company is not producing whatever they produce. So I think that when you get to a strike, it's too late. So I think it's important for us to continue the dialogue, stay at the table, even if it's hard feelings, employers and employees should stay at the table and get those negotiations done. My time as Mayor Boston, I intervened on several strikes that were successful. My time as Secretary of Labor, I've intervened on several strikes that have been ended in a good way. So I do feel that we need to keep those conversations dialogues going. The build back, better build appears to be dead at this point and Senator Manchin has effectively blocked it. I think it's fair to say there are some labor provisions in that bill. Does that strike you that Senator Manchin is anti-labor, therefore? I wouldn't say it's dead. I would say that it might be on pause a bit, I hope. No, I would not say Senator Manchin's anti-labor. I've had many conversations with the Senator. Certainly he represents the people in the state in West Virginia, the miners in particular, their union eyes that he represents them very tough, very strongly. But I think that there is hopefully dialogue will continue as we get into the new year, a little further into the new year. And there are some great provisions in the build back, better build that I'd love to see come into existence. Pre-Candygaden, childcare, adult care, job training money, all of those are important for our economy moving forward. It also looks difficult to get that $15 minimum wage law passed. I saw that Kroger was paying $25 an hour up in the Midwest, had a job opening there. What are the chances that I'd ever had? I can't understand why somebody is against a $15 minimum wage, a baseline minimum wage for families. It just doesn't make any sense to me. People use the excuse, well it's going to hurt business. It doesn't hurt business. Look at the states where the minimum wage is $15 an hour or look at the companies that have raised their minimum wage to $15 sometimes $25, $18. Those companies are raising their wages because they're doing great. They're not raising their wages because they're going out of business. So in states aren't going out of business and losing business because of that. So I don't quite understand why we don't have a $15 now, a federal minimum wage right now in our country. The Department of Labor did raise the minimum wage for federal employees this year, going into effect January 1st and I think we'll see some benefits of that, at least for families. You talked earlier, I think to us as a matter of fact, about modernizing unemployment insurance in this country. And I'm wondering where things stand with that effort. Is that something you'd still like to pursue? Oh, we're doing it right now. We have the Mornization Office here at the Department of Labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,48,2022-10-13 17:20:42
3240," in this country. And I'm wondering where things stand with that effort. Is that something you'd still like to pursue? Oh, we're doing it right now. We have the modernization office here at the Department of Labor in the UI system. We got a $2 billion investment from the American Rescue Plan. We're working on getting grants out to cities and towns, not cities, out to towns, states across the country, very encouraged by both Democratic and Republican-led states, are very engaged with the Department of Labor in modernizing their system. Speaking of states around the country, I think you visited 30 last year. 60 cities, 30 states. What did you learn? Why do you want to do this and what did you learn? Well, I learned that the challenges that American workers have are in every state in this country. I found that it's been great going around to the states because I come from Massachusetts, I come from the Northeast, and anyone that knows us, we pretty much stay where we are. But I've had a chance to go all over the country down to Memphis, and out to California, and to Alabama, in different places. And it's great to talk to people. What I do know, the biggest thing I've seen, and I wouldn't say this is great, but the challenge and struggles people have in America, whether it's around child care or any good wages, that's a big problem in our country. One thing people have criticized workers for, if you will, is that they are not moving as much as Americans used to. I don't know whether that's the case or not, but I've heard it anecdotally. In other words, people are sort of stuck in towns that may be depressed, and they should move to places where there's more job creation. Do you think that's true or...? That's the first I've heard of it, but I definitely think that we should be making investments in those towns that are depressed and bring more jobs to those areas. And I think that's the responsibility of government to do that, to create more opportunities for people in the cities and towns so they can build their towns up. Rather than people exit cities and towns, try and create opportunities in the cities and towns. Secretary, I want to ask some questions about you personally, and growing up, and back in Boston, which you talked about. When you were a young child, you had a battle with cancer, and I'm wondering how that informed you in your life, and you're thinking about things. Yeah, when I was seven, I was diagnosed with Burkutslum Pharma, which is a form of childhood cancer. I dealt with it. I got it in 1974, so the prognosis back then was not as good as it is today, thank God, with medicine. But as a child, it didn't inform you, but as I got older, I realized that what my family went through, and what I went through, made me think a little differently about how I govern, how I lead, and really thinking about making sure opportunities. So, for example, in Massachusetts, I was proud to vote for universal health insurance in Massachusetts. We did it before Obamacare, and it was a good vote because I knew that there were thousands of families in Massachusetts, like the same place my family was in 1974, that didn't have a lot of money and resources, but create an opportunity for families today to have health care. You followed your father into the union, and I'm wondering what you talked about, but I'm wondering, what did you take away from that? What did you get out of that? And what drew you to that, actually, besides just your dad? Well, first and foremost, I shouldn't have dropped out of college to go on the, and my father was dead against it, but I did drop out. And what I learned was the ability for hard work and what it means, and understanding that, you know, I'm fortunate in my life, the opportunities I've had in my life, and my father went to work every day, and millions of people at my father went to work every day, and got dirty and came home. It was able to support a family, raise a family, put food on the table. My father was able to live with dignity when he retired because he had a pension. My father was able to die with dignity because he knew that his pension would be able to go to my mother when he died. So that union gave my family the opportunity from the time he came off the plane in Ireland when he joined the union to the day that he passed away, and my mother still has that same pension my father had. What's the biggest difference between being the mayor of Boston and the U.S. Labor Secretary? Oh, when you're the mayor of the boss, you know, President Biden is my boss, and I'm going to President Biden is my boss. I work with the guys over there, and ladies over there should say, no, it's a little different. It's an executive role being mayor, and it's executive slash policy role being Secretary of Labor. And obviously the geographic reach of the Secretary of Labor's job is 50 states and also territories in our country. And also we also have international labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,49,2022-10-13 17:24:57

3242," you What about partisan politics here in Washington Secretary Walsh? Is it different than from Boston and how have you been able to deal with that? Completely different than when I was in the Massachusetts House Represents. You know, many of the Republicans in the House were friends of mine. And you know, you might have an argument debate on the floor, but when you walked out the door, it wasn't personal. And I think the partisan stuff here in Washington is a little too much. And I think the American people are being turned off by it. I think that we have to realize that whether you're a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent, you represent people. And you represent all the people in the district, they're not just the... I'm a Democrat. That doesn't mean that Secretary Labor, I represent just Democrats. I represent everyone in America who is looking for anything from the Department of Labor. That's what I do. And I think we have to think about that more in the country. All right. Speaking of Massachusetts, I have to ask you, it's been reported you've considered running for governor of Massachusetts. Anything to that? Yeah, I haven't considered anything. You know, I am the Secretary of Labor. You know, I got a call from my governor, Chai Baker, who I had a very good relationship when I was the mayor of Boston. He's retiring. I congratulate him on his retirement. And I'm focused on my job as Secretary of Labor. Final question, Secretary. What do you consider what would you like to have as your legacy? Oh, God. Honestly, I'm not a big legacy guy. I want to make sure that people I work with every day that their legacy is strong, honestly. And I'd like to see the Patriots win about six more Super Bowls. That actually is probably going to be very difficult right now. They're not looking that bad. We'll see. We'll see. They're not bad right now. Mac Jones is okay. He's looking quite of back. He's only a rookie. More in the playoffs. That's all that matters. Right. All right. U.S. Labor Secretary Martin Walsh. Thank you so much for your time. Thanks for having me today.

3243," It is Thursday, October 13th here in New York City on Brad Smith. Jes goes out there with made v winter, sl Weftkami,ris District everyone sunk into тол November灶 A measbolts of 2002. All of this, of course, goes back to the Fed raising interest rates and also has already had ripple effects throughout the housing market, putting pressure on pricing, putting pressure on demand and affordability. We've been watching these mortgage numbers very, very closely because obviously they have really ratcheted up the monthly cost for people who are taking out a 30-year mortgage in order to buy a house. So we've got that number, we've got that CPI number. All of it pointing to continued inflation at least for now. But now we're joined by someone who has has her eyes on potential deflation. That, of course, is Kathy Wood, our our our confessed founder and CEO and you recently wrote an open letter to the Fed where you warned about deflation. We talked to Michael Darda of MKM at the top of the show where he said the Fed is making the mistake of looking at backward looking indicators. What should the Fed be looking at Kathy when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation? Sure, hi Julie, and Brian. Well, if you look at what's happening in the pipeline, what you're seeing in terms of commodity prices are some very serious declines both from their peaks and year over year now. So that is sort of we would say that's upstream inflation that is heading towards the PPI and then ultimately the CPI. So we've got gold prices and in fact, I looked at them yesterday. I had thought that the last two years gold had been trading within the a 1700 to nearly $2,100 range and that's true it has and it has broken down. This is a really good leading indicator of inflation. What caught my surprise yesterday was looking at where gold was in 2011. It was roughly this level. So you can say since 2011 more than 10 years, we haven't had a big burst in a big breakout in the gold price and that is informing our decision here. Gold is a leading indicator of inflation and it has not broken out. It is breaking down. And then the second thing that we're looking at is the inventory glucked around the world and especially in the United States. It looks like some of the best supply chain managed companies in the world have overordered. They ignored their automated enterprise resource planning system so ERP systems and double ordered, triple ordered so that Nike for example, its sales were up only 3.5 percent globally last quarter and yet its inventory was up 44 percent and in the United States there were up 68 percent and if you look at it in transit, there are up 85 percent. So that's just one indication. We're seeing lots of inventory overhangs and even online sales are suffering. Amazon just had its second prime day and it showed no increase which is really from a year over year which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CPI that we got today is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,52,2022-10-13 17:37:41
3244," over year, which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CEPI that we got today is a lagging indicator. It always is a lagging indicator. And we're seeing a lot of prices in the pipeline that are falling. So Kathy, let's talk about what this means for the Fed and your open letter to the Fed, where you urge them to consider some of what you're talking about right now. The market after today's data is now more fully pricing and not just a 75 basis point increase at this upcoming meeting, but at the one after that as well. Do you think the Fed should be done? Do you think they should even raise 75 basis points at this upcoming meeting? Or do you think they should stop here and give some time for their increases to make their way through the economy? Yes, as we're thinking about this question, we compare what Chairman Powell is doing to what Chairman Volker did in the late 70s, early 80s, when he was fighting an inflation problem that had been building for 15 years, Vietnam War, great society closing the gold window. That was a real inflation problem that built up over 15 years. This inflation problem has been 12 to 15 months by the time the Fed started addressing it, and we think it's much more a function of supply chain imbalances caused by COVID, and then again by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These are very, very different circumstances. So what the Fed has done this time around is it has increased interest rates. If they go another 75 basis points, which is very likely on November 2nd, they will have increased interest rates from 0.25 to 4%, and that's a 16 fold increase. What did Volker do in the early 80s? He took interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a two fold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to dealing with inflation and working around it over 15 years. This is a real shock to the system, and I do believe we will see the ramifications, in many ways we're seeing housing shutting down, and I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession, and we believe this recession now will be sustained. If we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. Kathy, so do you see a severe recession, and then how long do you think this bear market will continue? Well, what's interesting, I think many people are coming around to the idea that we're in a recession or we're going into a recession. The first two quarters with real GDP growth negative to us means we're in a recession. Now that many people are worried and are beginning to see recession for as far as the eye can see, we are looking at this recession a little bit differently. We think it's going to be a function of this massive inventory overhang, and that it's going to be a serious inventory correction, but it's not going to be anything like we saw in 0809. That was a systemic financial problem caused by the mortgage and financial meltdown. We don't think this is the same thing. Now that many economists are starting to agree with us that we're in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit too alarmist if this is just an inventory recession. But I think the Fed will have a lot to do with whether or not it is. This is a shock, though, to the system and this idea that we have an inventory overhang, we think it's going to get bigger as consumers pull back low saving rates, 3.5% versus 8% where it was before COVID. And so we'll see. We think this holiday season is going to be pretty tough. And so as you kind of read your shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, when you think about some of the kind of ways that equity valuations are starting to price in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,53,2022-10-13 17:41:58
3245," And so as you kind of ready your shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, and you think about some of the kind of ways that equity valuations are starting to price in that recession to the best of their ability, is there a big buy that you now kind of think through or evaluate going into the end of the year here? Well, you have to consider the source here and our focus, our sole focus, is on disruptive innovation. And we also believe that innovation solves problems. We had a tough time going into COVID with our kind of strategy. And then we had a boom in our strategy during COVID because guess what? We needed the genomic revolution to help sequence the coronavirus and figure out tests and vaccines and our kinds of companies helped with that. We think with supply chain issues and with the food and energy prices caused by this shock, this Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that once again innovation is going to help solve these problems. Electric vehicles, there's an accelerated consumer preffership towards electric vehicles like Tesla because of oil prices. And we think there's no stopping that trend now. And in terms of food prices, we do believe that gene editing is going to help us figure out how to produce crops in areas that are less fertile than the Ukraine, the bread basket of Europe, with less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. So we're going to continue to see the miracles associated with the genomic revolution. But our other strategies as well, whether we're talking about robotics, solving the labor shortage, energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles, pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become more competitive if they use their data and combine it with other data in effective ways. And then blockchain technologies, which is going to take the middle men out of a lot of businesses and take the cost out of a lot of businesses, helping us to solve this inflation problem. So again, consider the source. We think innovation solves problems. It certainly gave us an appreciation of that during COVID. Our strategy was high flying. And we think we have the more problems right now. So stay tuned. Kathy, this economic shock that you talk about in large part at the hands of the Fed, does that cause a shock to one of your long term holdings in Tesla, in terms of the stock price and also the company's financials? Well, certainly all stocks are experiencing difficulty in this environment as the market tries to understand how far the Fed is going to go and how deep this recession is going to be. So Tesla, as I mentioned, is a solution to the problem. It's very interesting. If you look at gasoline demand this summer in the United States, it dropped below COVID levels, the worst of COVID, and it dropped to levels that we have not seen since 1997. That's real demand destruction. And it couldn't have happened. We do not believe without electric vehicles at the margin, taking huge share from traditional automobiles. So if we had to be concerned about an industry, it would be the traditional auto industry. We think that gas powered vehicles are going to be obsolete within the next five to 10 years. And the traditional auto industry has to figure out a way to migrate into electric vehicles and into the next big phase, which we think Tesla is leading, the autonomous taxi platform phase. So lots of changes here. Traditional industries are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Cathy, when we last talk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,54,2022-10-13 17:46:15
3246," These are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Kathy, when we last talked back in the spring, I believe it was just at the beginning of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. Now we are maybe, maybe getting to a little bit of closure in that case. But I would post you the same question that I asked you then because a lot of time is elapsed in different events have happened. Are you at all concerned about Musk's attention wavering now that it looks like he is in fact going to be taking over and likely at least having a pretty heavy hand in running Twitter? Well, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You don't think it'll be a mess if that happens. It'll just be sort of a free for all where it's tougher to find commentary of value. It's interesting about Twitter and what we found this we have a lot of debate around arcs own strategies. We can filter that debate ourselves so we can unfollow people if we think there's bad behavior, but that's our choice. And we can follow those people who we think are moving discussions, whether it's about innovation or the economy moving, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there. And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools to filter out the nonsense and get right down to business. I certainly would like to filter out a lot of the nonsense sometimes on Nerkati. I want to ask you more broadly about arc invests and your funds. And the funds that we have seen, which we're seeing sort of bigger swings to the up end of the downside earlier in the year. They've gotten a little more muted as of late. You talk a lot about your three to five year time horizon, which I think makes sense. But I wonder how long how patient investors are going to be particularly in an environment where they are seeing losses, not just in our K. But in lots of other areas as well. Yes, and I think one thing that helps our clients is our research. And they see that it's first principles research. We have the long term time horizon. And we're seeing spectacular exponential growth opportunities. And not only one by one, the various platforms I just described, but the convergence of those platforms. So one ask her feeding another. And I think many of our clients understand that they're short innovation. Truly disruptive innovation. If you own the NASDAQ or the NASDAQ 100 right now and you look through that index. This is not the index that I grew up with in the 80s and 90s when we were looking for innovation. We'd go to the NASDAQ. But if you look through the NASDAQ now and especially the NASDAQ 100, what you see are 25% of the names touching disruptive innovation. The rest of them are kind of me too. They look like other indexes, the fangs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla would be our only overlap. And then you look further and more deeply into these indices. And you see names that you'd never expect to be there food and beverage utilities, rails, brick and mortar retail. These are not innovation companies. And so what we've done at ARC is we are pure play innovation. And we'd like to think we are what the NASDAQ used to be in the 80s and 90s. And it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long-term investment time horizon. So I think our sharing our research.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,55,2022-10-13 17:50:53
3247," and 90s and it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long-term investment time horizon. So I think our sharing our research and our pointing out to investors look what you think you own in innovation is not what it used to be and what ARC is doing is really back to the future. We're all about investing in the future as opposed to indexes which are more about past success. Those companies that have been extremely successful have risen to the top of these indexes. But if we're right in these five platforms that involve 14 different technologies are going to disrupt the traditional world order, then investors need to get to the right side of change. And one of the other things that we do is one of our missions and values is to educate. That's why we give our research away and we want to educate not only investors but parents and grandparents about how the world is changing, how radically it's changing and how it's ever more important to get especially students on the right side of change so that they can enjoy these incredible growth opportunities and not be disrupted by industries that will be sunsading shall I say. Kathy, a three to five year time horizon means not only kind of mid-term or recession-proofing your companies, you're not just recession-proofing your portfolio, you're also kind of midterm-proofing your portfolio, you're a general election-proofing your portfolio. And so, you know, ARC, how do you go about identifying disruptive innovation that then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda? Well, we have a six metric scoring system, very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. Thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy. And so, in the in the early days of ARC in 2014-15, we were thinking, okay, government may be very concerned about the safety of autonomous vehicles. But as we've moved through these last eight years, what we've seen, thankfully, is the government and regulators in particular very focused on data. And what does the data say? The data says that most fatalities and accidents, 85, almost 90% of them, are caused by a human error. If we take the human being out of the equation, then we're going to save up to 35, 40,000 lives in the United States, the fatalities per year, and up to 1.25 million around the world. So, that is a noble goal. And we've been very gratified to see the regulators looking at the fatalities in Tesla's vehicles and informing us that for the most part, most of those fatalities were caused by human error. And for the second, that people who are driving Tesla vehicles are much safer thanks to the various automated driving capabilities now. Up to 40% safer than in most other cars. So, we're very focused on what governments are studying in terms of the data. And if they stick to the data, innovation typically solves problems and makes the world a better place. Really, always a treat to get some time with you. Cathy Wood, Ark, Invest Founder, and see you. Always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Appreciate the time. Thank you, Brian. Julie as well. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Let's stay on the economy here. Inflation is still running hot. As we saw in today's consumer price index, that comes as economic growth continues to be sluggish and recession calls pick up on Wall Street. Let's dive into the economic outlook with Jair Bernstein, who is a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jair, always great to talk with you. I don't know if you heard, but we just had noted investor Cathy Wood on call.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,56,2022-10-13 17:54:57
3248," Jar Bernstein, who is a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Jar, always great to talk with you. I don't know if you heard, but we just had noted investor Kathy Wood on calling for a potential economic shock because what we're seeing with inflation and the Fed, we'll have to get your take on it. Well, I think the underlying fundamentals when it comes to particularly the labor market remain very strong in this economy. And that's a really important tail when family budgets are challenged by these high price levels. So, when you have an unemployment rate of 3.5%, you're adding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month, 10 million jobs since this President got here. That's going to help working families offset some of the pressures they're facing on the price side. But it certainly doesn't get the job done and we've got a lot more to do in that space. And that's why at the direction of the President, we have focused like a laser on doing all we can to ease price pressures on the supply side of the economy when it comes to the ports, when it comes to shipping costs, air freight costs, energy costs. And of course, the inflation reduction act with its reduction in costs for medical care, for premiums, for prescription drugs, and also for clean energy. So, I think the question is, A, is there a strong labor market at your back, the answer is yes, B, is this administration doing everything we can to help ease those pressures? Also a firm yes on that one. Jared, I want to pick up on the energy part of all of that in particular. And listen, I know you're not a foreign policy guy, but obviously what's been going on between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia has been getting a lot of attention and the Saudi support of the OPEC production cut, which has been problematic for the global energy market. We were looking for prices to continue their downward trajectory. What can the White House do and what is it doing domestically in terms of continuing to push for more production domestically? Well, let's set the level here with just a little bit of a background on what's been going on in energy markets because I certainly agree with a lot of your characterization, but we got that in the CPI report this morning, which is a motivation for our discussion. A gas price is actually down about 5 percent in September and at an annualized rate of almost a third, about 30 percent in the third quarter. And of course that reflects almost 100 days of declining gas prices. Now to get to your question, and also to reference back what I was talking about in terms of what this White House can do to help, that reflects the very large distribution of 180 million barrels of oil from the strategic reserves. That's ongoing to be clear. It's another 10 million barrels coming October, November. So that's an ongoing addition to global supply. But we have to do more, especially in the light of this misguided and I think a very wrong headed decision by OPEC+. I'm not going to talk about the geopolitics. That's not my lane. I will say the president has consistently since then gone out and talked about the importance of sharing some of those wide profit margins with consumers to give them a bit more breathing room with the pump. If you look at the spread between the wholesale and the retail price, it's still quite elevated. But let's not forget that at the pump, the national price, about $3.90 gallon is down over a dollar from its peak in June. We need to see more of that kind of breathing room for consumers and that's one of the things we're going to keep pressing on. The reality is that individuals households, they can't afford to stop spending on some of the necessities whether that's food, whether that's energy prices, whether that's some of the rent prices even that we've been tracking. And so even with a longer, more protracted kind of an era of higher inflation, higher prices that people are paying, what do you believe from the White House side are some of the longer term implications of that that may also begin to show up on the back end? So here's my answer to that. I think when you're thinking about that question, which looks around a corner, corners are very hard to look around right now. As you know, everybody's crystal ball is kind of cracked. Inflation is a global phenomenon. It's higher in many other countries than it is here. But I think the right thing to do is ask yourself, are the institutions most directly responsible for this challenge doing what they need to do? Because in other cases, modern scientists, technology族, their Sultanate, their perlu, industrial sucker, savez came along with an intellectual Haus and launched by Hertz,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,57,2022-10-13 17:59:33
3249," But I think the right thing to do is ask yourself, are the institutions most directly responsible for this challenge doing what they need to do? The Federal Reserve absolutely yes, okay? They're their pivot, they're tightening campaign. I'm not going to get into the details because we stay out of their knitting. But they're very much engaged as they should be the president and has endorsed that pivot. Are we doing everything we can as I've tried to explain yes in the energy space and the supply chain space helping to unsknarl supply chains, inflation reduction act, chip sack, infrastructure act helping to boost the economy supply site. Are policies makers doing what they need to do? Is it taking effect? Well, if we dig into the inflation report today, we see goods inflation was actually flat in September. That's useful. But of course, housing inflation, shelter inflation created more pressures. Well, is the Fed's action cooling the housing market unequivocal? Yes, it takes time for that lag to work its way into the CPI. But we're already seeing some cooling in the housing market actually non-trivial both on the rental side and the ownership side. I'm chair, just very quickly. We've been starting to hear not just from Kathy Wood, but other economists that inflation, forward looking inflation indicators are already starting to come down. So just to put your pure economist hat on for a moment, is inflation going to take care of itself? Should the Fed and the White House actually maybe take a step back to here and say inflation will come down without us having to push things into a recession? Well, I think that's a complicated question that gets into a lot of debates, some of which would have me a lot more into the Fed's knitting than I'm willing to go in this position. You're right. When I was a punitive chin-flapping plane, you know, I get into this all day. It's a good question. But from our perspective, we want to respect the Fed's independence. I think the question again redounds quite simply to the following. The Fed is the first and foremost inflation fighter. This President has said we deeply respect their independence. So we're not going to comment on their granular policy, but he has said that this pivot that they've made is a very appropriate pivot given the challenge of price pressures. On our side, you've seen, you know, well more... Let me put it this way. I have never been part of a White House or any other job in my long political economy career where we've done more to try to help on the economy supply side. I never talked about dwell time in my long career. That's how that's the amount of time that containers spend in ports. Now I wake up every morning and check dwell times and they are significantly down through put through the ports is at historical levels, shipping costs, air freight costs, down significantly. Those actions have our fingerprints on it. We worked closely with the private sector, so there's a real partnership there. But again, the question to get away from the granular who's doing the right thing and the timing of all that, very complicated, quite... Nobody has the right answer to that. What you really need to ask is are there relevant institutions that fight inflation doing what they need to do and the answer for this White House and for this Federal Reserve is an unequivocal yes? Jared, all of us have gotten to get a big education about supply chain terminology to be sure. Jared Bernstein, member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, thank you so much for your time this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up, we'll get another check on markets and dig into some of the moogers here as we see.

3250," what This is Yahoo Finance Live. We are seeing stocks still lower the Dow right now off of 186 points about half 1% but as you can see, we are well up off the lows of the session here, even though we are still sharply lower. So that initial alarm over CPI fading a little bit as people try and game out what the Fed is going to do next. We are seeing a similar phenomenon with the S&P, although it's still down 1.2% or so and the NASDAQ down about 1.9%. Likewise, we continue to watch what's going on with yields here the 30 or yield 3.92% and the 10-year yield coming just a hair back below 4%. Also in terms of movers, we are watching shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Bloomberg is reporting that the two grocers are in talks potentially to combine that an announcement could come as soon as sometimes this week or the next week Albertsons shares sharply higher. Kroger shares a little bit lower. We're going to battle it out in our bull versus bear segment this week. The focus will be on meta.

3251," Welcome back. It is time to battle it out in our bowl versus bear segment for the week. This week we put the spotlight on meta. Needham, senior analyst Laura Martin has an underperform rating on the stock saying costs will exceed revenue growth over the next two years. Welcome Laura and we've also got a B. Bernstein senior analyst Mark Schmohlich reiterating his outperform rating saying he sees light beyond the dark welcome mark as well. Okay, so let's get into this. First and foremost, we've got to talk about the advertising revenue right now for meta platforms, especially as so many companies are pulling back on some of their ad spend really looking at some of their cost restructuring as well. And so Laura, I want to go to you first on this as we see even more of that demand for digital advertising continuing to unfortunately see this vacuum given the restructuring that many companies are doing. What does that mean and net out for what should we should expect going forward for meta platforms and the underlying subsidiaries and Facebook Instagram? You're right. The macro environment continues to deteriorate. We think many ad driven companies will miss their fourth quarter earnings. And in meta's case, not only is just the macro environment deteriorating, but they're losing a lot of user time to tick talk. And that continues to happen. Tick-Tock now is up to 75% share of adults under 25 here in America, which is the highest ARP who region for meta. So we're worried about both ad unit availabilities as people move time into tick talk. And we're worried about demand softness at the advertising level. And 100% of meta's revenue comes from auction. So if you have a falling demand for units, you get light pricing for the units that you do have to sell. Mark, want to get your reaction to that? I mean, you're calling this a make or break quarter for meta. Absolutely. And I think Laura's right that there's certainly all these, you know, the very loud bear case right now where it is time to prove it even in this tough macro environment. And you know, there's really kind of three legs of things that they need to go off and effectively dispel. One is on the engagement side. And you know, since they had that for one quarter where they lost a million users, they've gained about 40 million Facebook Blue users. Now granted much of that's international, but domestic's out fine. On the revenue front, it is a tough macro, but we're seeing them actually set up a little bit better. Actually, starting to gain back some share of wallet from advertisers. Primarily as, you know, they've made some improvements on advantage, sorry, on, you know, the idea for on they've launched advantage plus, which certainly helps a lot of advertisers, you know, make decisions around kind of automating the the ad delivery process. And they've launched a lot more ad inventory ramping up advertising load on reels, launching new ad inventory elsewhere. And so, you know, we're starting to see them make progress against much that's been weighing down the stocks and seeing the last year. Mark, what a stay with you for a hot second. The reality of the revenue construct for for meta, especially as they make a big push into the meta verse. I mean, my goodness. Are we going to be buying $1,400 glasses to wear augmented reality glasses to wear within our households or even at work? Who knows? I bought one, not saying everybody else will. So I'll try it out. But, you know, I think where we are right now, that's certainly captures the headlines and certainly the number that they've been spending, you know, to kind of build out that meta, their metaverse ambitions is, you know, certainly kind of sticker. Shot it changed the whole name. Exactly right. You know, but I don't think that matters right now for the stock to work, right? Because I think the stock is back to questions around really core fundamentals. Folks can understand, you know, that's like a more long term initiative. I'm imagine investors will love it if they were spending a lot less on it. I think we're going to see some of that discipline. They're not going to bend in anything at all. But you certainly see discipline that, you know, investment in growth areas is going to be tied to core performance. You know, and so I think investors do need to see that discipline. And so long as engagement is holding and revenues are turning the corner off the bottom, you know, I think they kind of will allow them to continue to kind of build up even if it's not necessarily desired. But, you know, it's certainly a long term view.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,60,2022-10-13 18:12:22

3253," going on with the consumer. We feel really good about the breakfast segment. We feel really good about our brand and how we stand tall. People need their coffee and their breakfast sandwich to start their morning. So we've seen really strong results for our brand in the last couple of months. Scott, full stop. I was critical to changes in the Roarth program, but it's coming from a place of love. I have to dunk an app. I go to dunk it all the time. And a lot of other people seemed to have caught my vibe. Have you looked at what you made here and are making any changes now to respond to consumers? Yeah, so, and I know it comes from a place of love from you, Brian. Absolutely. Here's what I would say. We rolled out our Dunkin Perks program in 2014, and we haven't made any changes in the last eight years. And we went out and we talked to our core users, and we said, what do you want from a program? And they said they wanted three things. They wanted more variety. Because in the old program, you could just get a beverage. They wanted more flexibility. And we've now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves. They can buy a sandwich for their family or a whole meal for the soccer team. And they said they wanted recognition. So big users like you want to be recognizing we now have a boosted status. And so we've put those three things in place. We're really excited about this new program. We gave out four billion free points in the last three days. And the response has been overwhelming with positive. OK, fair enough. That's good to hear. But the birthday drink is the industry standard. Like I know, I would like to get a free birthday coffee until I ultimately drop dead and six feet under. I mean, do you think you'll bring that back? So we're talking about that for sure, Brian. But one thing we did do is, well, we did take that piece away. What we added is come in either the day before your birthday, the day of your birthday or the day after, get three times points, points that won't expire as long as you come a couple times a year. And you can actually get something besides just a beverage. You could get a donut, you could get a sandwich, you can get avocado toast, a lot more flexibility, which is what our guests wanted. So you're really monitoring some of the taste profiles that the trends on what consumers are moving towards in their purchases for anything from lunchtime to starting off the day. So where are you still seeing the most traffic at what point in the day to really make some of the menu decisions and changeovers there? Yeah, we're certainly a morning day part business. So 70% of our business happens before 11 AM. And honestly, when COVID happened and we had that shutdown, we were all very nervous when the commute was not happening. But people shifted their behaviors a little bit. And they came to us a little later in the morning and they came for a couple beverages, maybe to share with their spouses while they're working at home. But really, the trend that's happening is all around ice beverages. And we invented ice coffee. We're a leader, whether it's ice coffee, whether it's cold brew, our new refresher line, it's all about ice beverages and great attachment with snacking items to that. Hey, Scott, it's Julie here. I mean, I gotta say it's like, I guess I wanna know a little bit more about the whole recession, spending patterns, et cetera, because you sound super positive. And I'm just wondering what signs if any you see of trade down, for example, of a drop in traffic of any kind of sign that, you know, the anecdotal and data pain that we are talking about every day if you guys are seeing any evidence of that. Yeah, we do see some of it. And here's what I'd say anecdotally. What happens in our business is, when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a Duncan or some other restaurant. But especially with Duncan, I think after a couple days or a week, people realize they need their morning Joe to get started, right? They need their coffee to fuel their day and we've seen it come right back up. And I think uniquely positioned for us, Duncan, it is a value offering, right? So we've got great products, both beverage and food, at a great price point, at the speed of Duncan. I think that's an unmatched combination out there. Scott, I go to my local Duncan every Saturday. I mean, it's just a ritual I have. And every time I'm in line, I want your huge in the morning, which is a good thing I'm sure, but everybody's buying coffee, notably iced coffee. How big a percentage is donuts now on your business? And what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,62,2022-10-13 18:24:26
3254," And is donuts now on your business? And what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right. Ice coffee is the future. That last year was the first year we sold more ice beverages than hot beverages. That's what the next generation of consumer wants. They want these ice cold beverages. They want highly colorful products that they can share on Instagram. But I will say our donuts, no one does donuts like we are. We are obviously a national and a global leader on donuts. You got to come try our spider donut, which we just rolled out for Halloween. We've got a jack-a-lantern donut. There's nothing more shareable and more fun. And a nice treat to yourself than a donut. As you've got more people returning either to office or to schools that breakfast wars, that's continuing to brew and heat up. What's Duncan's positioning in that breakfast war and what are going to be the keys to essentially helping it retain that consumer mind share and that dollar at the beginning of the day? Yeah, a couple of things. First of all, we have an incredible brand with a lot of brand love. So we tap into that loyalty like that new program. The second is some degree of everyday value or targeted digital value. So through our app, we are going to have the ability to have laser-focused offers that go right to you and what you want and give you incredible value in our program. And then the last thing I'd say is we've got, it's through our app, our ability to order ahead. So Brian, when you see those long lines, you download the app, order ahead. It'll be ready when you get there and the crew will hand it to you and you'll be off and running for your busy day. Scott, I just, I need the birthday drink back. I'm going to Duncan anyway, lad. I'm going to get off of here. I'm going to Duncan. I just need the birthday drink back. Please, please. Brian, I'm going to come deliver coffee to you personally on your birthday. I'll take that. April 4th. There we go. Yeah, done. Deal. Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. Thank you guys. Coming up, everyone, we're going to do a final check. Of the markets on the other side of this short break. Well, that was quite a two hours. Hope you enjoyed the ride. We certainly did.

We saw the jumps is in cereal and bakery products now This is considered the highest since the 70 late 70s and early 80s. I was confirmed by Steve Reed and economists at the Bureau of Labor statistics Of course those higher pricings being driven by higher gasoline oils Transportation weighing on the cost for both groceries and farmers alike of course energy costs here Decreased by 2.6% gasoline down 5.6% making a cheaper to transport goods, but still higher Of course also to kids can say consideration rising worker wages and prices for impact costs like packaging Fertilizer there and now here if you take a look cereal and bakery products being driven higher by of course that rushes Ukraine Invasion that happened earlier this year also fruit and vegetables being impacted here of 10.4% Due to a historic drought facing the western half of the country impacting crop yields there We got to talk about egg inflation here. It looks like some items including eggs are seeing a bit of a price decline Other is not so much. I just wondering what items are sticking out to you. That's very well to make it clear Americans can still inspect sticker shock here when they go to the grocery store Yeah, exactly. There's really no relief just yet. Of course we see right here that eggs a month of a month down 3.5% milk Down 1.3% but this of this is doable to some of the impact some of the Climate events that happen over the summer of course eggs buyers recovering from the springs avian influenza outbreak That's what doctor Michael Spence in a Wells Fargo telling me but dairy dealing with a hot summer They are in key markets also vegetables dealing with that record transportation costs shipping costs Expensive to decline here, but still taking a toll on prices here And if we take a look year over year of course higher prices across the board some of the highest increase here Flower lettuce potatoes Margarine milk and eggs eggs once again seeing a bit of relief, but still up 30% now jarred as you know This is a volatile index there hard to judge whether or not next month We might see a tick up a tick down there, but I also want to note that citrus Somebody to keep a lookout here on Wednesday the US Department of Agriculture said that Florida's orange crop this year It'll be the smallest in 1943 now. That's not even taking into account the effects of hurricane Irene So lots of fold out here, but Americans still expecting higher prices across the board Silver lining for you and I broke I hear that our lunchtime is getting picked up today by corporate But today only really appreciate that report in all serious and it's lots of higher prices to digest Young finances broke to Paul. Thank you sticking with this morning CPI report Let's welcome in and Nick Brooks ICG head of economics and investment research for his reaction to the numbers and Nick Let me just get your your thoughts your front line thoughts on those headline numbers here Especially that core reading would just shut up excluding food at energy Yeah, I think that's the key problem. I mean the headline number has been sort of gradually coming down since June But the real focus is on the core inflation, which is of course is what the Fed really cares about And that just keeps going up and as you were highlighting food inflation is very high Shelter inflation has also been a key driver of the rate health care costs and pretty much",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,65,2022-10-13 18:37:07
3257," keeps going up. And as you were highlighting, food inflation is very high. Shelter inflation has also been a key driver of the rate, healthcare costs, and pretty much across the board and services. So the problem with this type of number is, I don't think the Fed wants to continue raising rates. I think the Fed recognizes quite clearly that the economy is probably going into a slowdown over the next couple of quarters. But as long as those core inflation rates remain so high, they need to keep raising rates to keep it under control. So I think bottom line is, and the market seems to think, we're going to get 75 basis points from the Fed in November. And now markets are starting to price potentially another 75 in December. Yes. So not a good place to be. Yes, I even saw 100 basis point raise in November being price as I think the probability was 2% max. But just goes to show you the extent to which the Fed, which has really been consistent on its messaging. I was going through the FOMC minutes that were released yesterday. No big surprises at CPI, of course, being the bigger report here. But we've seen central bank action out of the bank of England, the bank of Japan, just get completely reversed. I mean, you look at the debt of the UK or the currency of Japan trading like emerging markets here. What do you make of the central bank or reaction? How painted into a corner are they? I think they're all painted into quite a severe corner. Now, you know, I'm based here in the UK. And I won't start talking too much about the UK, but they're in a very, very tight spot. And I think the problem is, you know, central banks haven't faced anything like this since the late 70s, early 80s, where you've got extreme inflation. And it's broad-based. And you know, the central bank recognized that growth is coming down. And if it wasn't for these inflation rates, they probably be cutting rates. But bottom line is they're worried that inflationary expectations could get out of control and will get the, you know, the feared wage price spiral that, you know, become self-fulfilling. So they have to talk tough, they have to act tough until inflation rates start coming down, even if it means recession. Well, and we've gotten comments, commentary from CEOs who may or may not be talking their books. But Jamie Diamond sticks out in particular, especially ahead of earnings, which we expect imminently this week. Tomorrow morning, and he's talking about another 20% decline in the S&P 500 already on its way there over the last couple days. Just wondering what you see in terms of the markets set up on any levels you're looking at. What are you looking for in the eventual rebound when we find a bottom finally? Yeah. I think there are a couple of things. My own view would be that, you know, a lot of the rate increases are in the market. So if you look at swap rates, if you look at forward rates, you know, I think a lot of the central bank hikes that are coming are actually in the market. I think where perhaps the market has not yet priced appropriately is the risk of quite a severe earnings decline as we move into potential recession. So I think the, you know, PEs need to come down further and the earnings are also likely to come down further. So I think there is certainly likely to be more downside on equity markets. The other point though I'd make is I think very similar to what we saw during the COVID, the worst of the COVID pandemic. I think it will be very sector focused. I think there are going to be some sectors that are clearly going to be hit much harder than others in this type of environment. But there also be some sectors that will perhaps be less affected. So I think one does have to take more nuanced approach if one has a medium term view on an medium term investment horizon. Investors need the nuanced view because the Fed is not playing the nuance game. Well said here Nick Brooks, ICG head of economic investment research. Thank you for your time today. Thank you. Before we go to break, check in on shares of Delta. You can see that company if we can get it on the screen there in a second. The company beat on revenue in the third quarter. And we spoke with CEO Ed Bastion who had this to say about airfare cost cuts that will benefit customers like you and me. We thought what happened earlier this spring when we pushed ourselves a little faster than we thought we could and the reliability suffered. So I'm confident we can get there by next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,66,2022-10-13 18:41:37
3258," So what happened earlier this spring when we pushed ourselves a little faster than we thought we could and the reliability suffered. So I'm confident we can get there by next summer. And as we bring that additional capacity back, that's going to help probably take a little bit of the pressure off of pricing for consumers. But more importantly, for Delta, it's going to enable us to get much better cost productivity and will be able to pass along some of that cost savings onto our customers. Coming up, feeling the domino effect. The fly material says it'll take a big hit on export curves for China. And that's his founder, giant TSMC, that's Taiwan. Taiwan semi, well, they're slashing capital spending in another sign of trouble for this sector. We're going to take a look at the movers after this. Welcome back. Chipmakers still flashing warning signs with the latest headlines from Taiwan semi adding to the gloom. The Taiwanese group cutting its budget for 2022, but shares higher on better than expected results. And more we have, the finances in S4A and more gloom for the chip sector under a lot of pressure already. Yeah, that's right. And if we look at the Philadelphia semiconductor index, I mean right now it's rebounding, but it had opened lower, was down as much as 4% earlier today. And the four day chart will show you that it's down 5% and a year-to-date chart shows these down 43%. But let's get to that chip sector that you were just mentioning and TSMC that beat on the top in the bottom line, cutting capital spending and also warning about slowing consumer demand. So moving into the fourth quarter, TSMC warning that it's seeing demand bladdish. Right now it's rebounding the stock. It's up 7%. But I also just want to mention that look the chip.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,67,2022-10-13 18:46:36
3259," TSMC warning that it's seeing demand bladdish. Right now it's rebounding the stock. It's up 7%. But I also just want to mention that look, the chip sector has been dealing with the fallout of the new government regulations to buy an administration's export control. So you've got applied materials, lamb research, applied materials saying that their fourth quarter is going to be impacting, impacted by this new regulation. So you've got this regulation on the one hand. And then you've got some of these chip makers that are talking about slowing consumer demand on the other hand, impacting. And keep in mind that the chip sector also is going through periodic cycles. So it was expected that in the second half of the year that we would see demand slow down, slower. And it's these stocks are such that kind of, they've kind of been the way the pandemic style stocks have been really high during the pandemic and then losing steam this year. Hey, we don't need any nuance on that. We know the hit that they've been taking and a lot of green on that board, it was read quite a bit earlier. All right, Yahoo, finances and S for it. Thank you for that report. Schneider Electric, one of the largest energy and power equipment providers in Europe and abroad unveiling new research and corporate ESG efforts at its presentation in Las Vegas. And finding, while there's little intention from companies to do green and be green, actually a lot of that intention, there's not enough follow-through. For more, we have Amir Paul Schneider, our electric president, North America. And thank you for coming here today. This is all part of your presentation at the Innovation Summit Las Vegas. Just tell us a little bit about the event and what we can expect from that. Well, first of all, thank you for having me. And yes, we're here with 1,500 customers, about 20% of the Fortune 500 is here. And the conversation that we're having is how do we move from an intent to action? There's been a lot of commitments made about getting to net zero, and that's great. More of those commitments are getting certified with science-based targets, which is an important next step. But really deploying the technologies and learning by doing is how we're going to create innovation that we desperately need. And that's really what we're talking to our partners, customers, and broader strategic alliances about here. The thing that's most important right now is that we remember that sustainability is also an efficiency driver. So it's got a bottom line positive impact. And I think that is going to be an acceleration point for all of the sectors. And a lot of the impetus behind the, well, behind the clean air movement and clean energy movement has to do with government subsidies, just wondering what the status of that is. We hear a lot about that with respect to Tesla and some of the other big makers, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes as well as we beef up our infrastructure. It's government subsidies for sure, especially for consumers, and it'll act as a catalyst for consumers to make the right choices. People want to do the right thing. And if it can be also providing a better experience, then these incentives are just going to make that transition happen faster. Think about people buying an EV. Once they buy an EV, they have an opportunity to put solar in their home. When they do that, they can add a battery. And then with technologies that we can work with the utilities to also make them producers of energy and maybe even sell some of that back in the right environments to the broader grid. So there's a real evolution where consumers are going to become prosumers. And we think this evolution is going to be catalyzed by things like the Inflation Reduction Act. But I want to go back to my earlier point. Investment and clean tech is about also making environments more efficient, not just in terms of being more green, but operationally more efficient. So it actually saves money in the long term. And we've published research with the Schneider Sustainable Institute that in existing buildings, we can build payback periods under eight years, not only making the buildings more efficient and in places like Las Vegas at the largest Hilton property in the world, we're demonstrating that as an active solution. What's some of the tech behind this, what you call next generation industrial technology that's being used to empower workers, specifically, how does this all fit together? So look, one key element is to bring digital into the space. As consumers, we've been living in the digital and internet era for about 20 years. But in the industrial space, data and digital assets are just being deployed at scale. And what digital does is it makes the invisible visible and brings all of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,68,2022-10-13 18:50:20
3260," but in the industrial space, data and digital assets are just being deployed at scale. And what digital does is it makes the invisible visible and brings all of that opportunities for optimization. What it also helps us do is take our scarce resource which is people and help them focus on the most important places where they can innovate and be creative. That is also going to create a lot of new jobs. We think there's an incredible opportunity in the clean tech space and solar, the number of electricians we're going to need and we're investing. In addition to working with people like Nika, the National Association of Electrical Contractors, we're investing with community colleges to make sure the next generation is ready to work in this IoT environment. Finally, we're also investing in manufacturing. We announced an additional $46 million invested in the United States to prepare for this wave of electrification. And that's on top of 100 million we invested in our factories last year. We appreciate your time here. I got to leave it there, Amir Paul Schneider, Electric President North America. Thank you. Coming up, if you think the S&P's 2022, excuse me, 2022 flood has been steep. Spare a thought for Kathy Wood's flagship fund, it has plummeted as more than twice the pace. So how is she feeling? My name's like Tesla and Roku now. You're going to hear from her up next. we're going on найдulee. Welcome back. We saw a red inflation print this morning with CPI coming in at 0.4% for the month and Kathy Wood weighed on one of the prints and more with our morning show today with us now is Julie Hyman and Julie. Lots going on in that interview. She talked about golden deflation but also the dreaded R word recession. Yes, and it was sort of linked in with what she's talking about with deflation as well. The chief see some deflationary impulses out there going on under the service particularly in Camarro. We talk about gold.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,69,2022-10-13 18:55:31
3261," And it was sort of linked in with what she's talking about with deflation as well. The chief see some deflationary impulses out there going on under the service, particularly in Camarro, and she did talk about gold. And so she talked about if indeed we are seeing deflation come down the pike, then the risk with the fed raising rates is that yes, we will see recession. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications. In many ways we're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession and we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. And it's pretty interesting, Julie, everybody talking about what the fed is going to do in November and December. But a lot of traders are already pricing in rate cuts for the end of 2023. We'll have to see how that pans out. But you also asked her about Elon Musk and the purchase of Twitter, of course, Elon and Tesla being one of the great disruption plays that she has. But what are thoughts on Elon taking over Tesla? Well, she doesn't have Twitter in the portfolio anymore. We should mention that. But she does have Tesla. And Tesla is one of the things that's done better in that portfolio amidst what has not done well overall, right? The arc, arc, arc, that benchmark ETF is down more than 60 percent for the year thus far. It's down in today's session even as other things are turning higher. So I asked her, what's the risk that Elon gets distracted and are you worried about what he's going to do for Twitter? She said she's excited about what Elon Musk could bring to Twitter. Listen. We are prolific users of Twitter. Our, uh, gives away its research. We give away our research, not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there is Twitter. Um, I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I, I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, uh, make it much more transparent. And I think add more value to that ecosystem. You know, it was interesting. I asked her, like, isn't it going to be a mess though? And there's all this stuff. And she said, no, she said two things. I thought we're interested in one. She said she herself will be able to filter out. And she thought that, um, a Twitter under Elon Musk could offer users maybe more filtering options. And so that it wouldn't necessarily be a noisy, harassing, ugly place under an Elon Musk scenario. Let's see, when it comes to Twitter, innovation under the old regime, we just got that edit button after what, 10 years. So, uh, yeah, I think it could be a little bit chaotic. I'm interested to see all the changes. I hope it doesn't break. I don't think it will because, uh, as news people were, uh, were prolific users of, uh, it's great. We are. It's like Cathy Wood. Yes. Yes. Very prolific here. Thank you for that. And great interview, by the way. Thank you. I have a few finances at Julie Hyman. All right. Now, doubly doubling down on consumer finance, Apple and Goldman Sachs will offer a new, high yield savings account for the Apple card saying it'll come with no fees or minimum posits. The idea is that users can use and manage the account directly from their existing wallet. Apple pay was launched in 2014. And the joint credit card, Apple card was established by both groups in 2019. Cora coming up, chorus of Doom sayers. There was Damien Diamond's recession call.

3262," A you you you today, with coming after an initial drop of just over 500 points here. S&P now up nearly 3% trading in the widest trading range that we have seen for this index since March 2020. Take a look at the NASAT composite. That's moving to the upset up just over 2% Russell 2000. Also railing today up just around 2% as well. Taking a look at the sector action here. And clearly we are seeing some broad base buying across the board, energy, financial technology, among the leaders lagging as consumer discretionary. If you can call that still up over 1% today. Take a look at some of those individual names that is leading us to the upside here. I mentioned the rally that we're seeing in big tech. Take a look at Apple. Apple up just over 3% today. Microsoft up over 4% Google staying in the green here and video up just around a 4% taking a look at the semis. We're also seeing some buying there. Now this is a group that has really been beaten down over the last several months, but particularly over what we've seen in the last five trading days. And again, we are seeing gains across the board Qualcomm and Intel there among the biggest gainers in Backroof. And then also the buying that we're seeing in some of these bank stocks ahead of earnings tomorrow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,71,2022-10-13 19:02:55
3263," Qualcomm and Intel, they're among the biggest gainers in that group. And then also the buying that we're seeing in some of these banks, stocks ahead of earnings tomorrow, JP Morgan up nearly five and a half percent, Wells Fargo up just over four and a half percent, Goldman even up just over four percent years. So, Michelle Broadbeast buying across the spectrum, certainly a very different picture as we head into the final hour training that what we were looking at shortly after the opening bell. And that does certainly seem to be the case with crypto as well as we take a look on the interactive for the action there. We saw Bitcoin bouncing back there this afternoon, as long along with the broader markets. I mean, look at the dip that we saw and shooting off straight to the races there in the middle of the afternoon. It has been an interesting week for crypto again with the SEC dashing hopes for a bit coin spot ETF from wisdom tree marking more than a dozen rejections for such ETFs. We do see a mixed picture for cryptocurrencies overall, ether still down, obviously, because it has not been fairing while ever since the merger. But in terms of crypto, we also saw Morgan Stanley and Leschina Shah suggesting that the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but not blockchain itself is becoming more centralized, finding, quote, reliance on the running of a large portion of the blockchain on a single or small group of cloud service providers becomes a non negligible risk to consider. So a little bit less risk there, at least she sees in the short term, Dave. All right, sounds good. My friend. Let's get you up to speed now on the housing market inflation, not the only thing heating up today mortgage rates jumping to a 20 year high now averaging 6.92% on the 30 year fix that's up from 666 a week ago and well more than the double the 305 from one year ago. Now Lawrence Yoon, the chief economist at realtor.com saying quote, even with an anticipated fall in home prices in some markets, principally in California, homes will continue to be unaffordable while rents are squeezing non owners. Now there is a glimmer of hope here on that front in terms of the rents rents grew 9% last month. That's the first single digit increase in a year according to Redfit. Demand is cooling for rentals and a record amount of building will improve supply. We expect it more than 400,000 units will come on the market this year. Haven't seen that in back back years since the 70s, Shana. All right, well that CPI print is the big story of the day coming in much hotter than expected inflation rising 8.2% in September and a year or year basis. We want to bring in Vince Reinhardt, Drifus and Melon, a chief economist, Vince, it's great to see you. So certainly it's interesting when you take a look at the market's reaction, but from an economist perspective, I guess this change your outlook at all just where we are in the economy right now, and what we could expect in the coming months. No, it just seals the deal for what the Fed will be doing in the near term 75 basis points that it's upcoming meeting in November and other 50 in December. What it tells you is that inflation, once it gets high, gets entrenched. The worrisome thing about the consumer price index report this morning was core inflation, strip out food and energy. That's growing 6.6% that's a 40 year high. It's getting into the prices of goods and services that are sticky and sticky lives up to its name. Hard to bud, but once they start going, they have momentum. And that's the Fed's problem. Inflations brought her base now. And we know that the Fed is playing catch up. And at this point, they want to do too much, rather too little to really get inflation under control. When you pass through some of the minutes that we just recently gone, how does that factor into some of these data points that are going to continue to come out being that this is the last CPI print we're going to see before the midterms? You're exactly right. That was the headline they wanted out of the minutes that were published yesterday. FOMC participants basically said, you could do too much, you could do too little. There's more danger if you don't do enough. While they fred it a little bit about what it means economic activity, they were much more concerned about inflation getting embedded and inflation expectations rise up to the same. So right now, monetary policy choices pretty easy. It's unpleasant, but it's easy. Because when inflation is so far above your 2% goal, they all know what to do and what they need to do is raise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,72,2022-10-13 19:07:48
3264," pleasant, but it's easy because when inflation is so far above your 2% goal, they all know what to do. And what they need to do is raise rates, and that's what they'll be doing. And they'll be doing tighter longer, and just about every CEO in the conference boards suggest a mild recession. Next year, and just about every guest on this show says the same. But Vince, is that going to be enough to drive down inflation? We're seeing earnings at least early on that show people there's no demand destruction. Despite dramatically higher prices, what will bring down inflation to 2% of its just mild, we get anywhere near it. Ultimately, it would be the Federal Reserve that returns inflation to its goal by being willing to keep the policy rate high for a long time. I actually don't think they'll get there next year. And that is because inflation is stubborn. And as you say, the economy slips into a recession when the unemployment rate starts rising. As inflation gets nearer to their goal, not near enough to it, they're going to have much more difficult policy choices. And chances are they'll blink. I.e. they won't keep rates high enough to get inflation back to 2. They'll satisfy themselves that inflation in the neighborhood of 2, even if it starts with a 3, is sufficient progress to ultimately get to the vehicle. And then you've been in the room before you've been part of the very similar types of discussions. What can you tell us? What do you think the conversations are like now inside the Fed when we do get a print like today's? So I think it's a combination of what I alluded to earlier. A lot of unanimity when inflation is so high, the urge to tighten is across all FOMC participants. But you're beginning to see them put markers down about the next fight. And the next fight is next year when the unemployment rate is rising, when the economy is in recession, some of them are going to want to slow the process down. And so underneath all that good feeling, underneath them all saying the same thing about the need to raise rates a lot in front load policy to accommodation is a beginning of this showing of the seams. Where they're worried, where there'll be a difference of opinion, where it's set show up, concerns about rising unemployment rate or recession, and global economic recession. That's back on the board now, particularly this week when the IMF and the World Bank annual meetings are ongoing. They're all going to the same meetings. They're all here in the same thing. Yes, you need to tighten. You also need to be aware that everybody's tightening monetary policy and their significant risks of financial stability. And then obviously the IMF releasing their global outlook, seeing reduced growth also in some of the major economies expecting a slow down there. They looked, they talked about the EU, China, and the US. How do you see the fact that we're such an interconnected world now with our economies? How do you see that playing out in terms of the pressure it might put on the US economy? A lot. And it's not global monetary policy accommodate. A coordination is actually emulation. When the Fed raises interest rates, it puts upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar. It puts downward pressure on everybody else's exchange rate, which is a force for inflation in Europe, in Japan, in emerging markets. Most central banks don't like it, and they're forced to follow the Fed up. So part of the message this week is recognize Fedors are we're all following you. That means your footprint is bigger on the global economy than you may appreciate. And that problems in the global economy will blow back to the US economy. That's the concern about next year. And as I want to close with the housing market, now mortgage rates certainly little rise and fall dramatically with rates, but more than 10 years, but needless to say another 75 point, it's probably going to take us above 7%. What do you see in the housing market? What do you think the Fed sees? It appears to be the first breaking point. So look, the Fed's got to work the tools it has in terms of the monetary",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,73,2022-10-13 19:11:55
3265," It appears to be the first breaking point. So look, the Fed's got to work the tools it has in terms of the monetary transmission mechanism. There's basically two reliable features. You raise rates, you choke off housing, you raise rates, you tend to put upward pressure on the exchange rate of the dollar. That's unpleasant for people looking for homes, and it's unpleasant for our trading partners facing downward pressure on their own exchange rates. I would think that housing is going to be troubled for a while. And the place to see that is actually abroad. In the UK, where more of mortgage activity is at variable rates, you see a much more sharper contraction and activity. Indeed, you see an inability to get mortgages at some point over the last couple of weeks. That's the future for the US. It just takes longer because we rely so much more on fixed rate mortgages. But as you said, fixed rate 30-year mortgages has been more than doubled in a year, and it's going up probably into the sevens next year. Indeed it appears, Sue.

3266," Markets in rally mode, despite a hotter than expected inflation print this morning, the Dow now trading above 30,000. Look at that 900 plus points up. What a rally Ryan Dietrich, Carson Group, chief market strategist is with us. Ryan, this is this is quite a day. This is quite a year. We're going to talk to Wall Street Plenty. Let's just speak to Main Street for a minute who's just confused because we get a bad inflation print, we get a good reaction from the market, we get a great job report and the market's do the opposite. Tell Main Street what to make of today. Yeah, well first off, thanks for having me on a day where things are green. Yeah. Which is something to talk about here. That's nice, nice change. But just today, we had the disappointing number, obviously markets were lower, but you look at what happened, we just corrected 50% of the overall bull market that we had off those 2020 lows, 3500. That's a normal type of retracement. We found some buyers there, wasn't shocking. The VIX, the fear gauge. It didn't surprisingly, didn't spike massively higher this morning. That would be a clue. The obvious market knew something and the rally came on. That's the biggest thing for Main Street, the people are really worried. Believe me, you're not the only ones confused. This year is very confusing for a lot of people, but think about this. In June 16th, we made those lows, 200 approximately, 200 stocks in the S&P made a new low. Just yesterday, we made new lows less than 80 stocks, made 52 week lows. What does that mean? Price is making new lows, but less stocks are. That Main Street, everyone listening, is an improvement. That's how major lows conform. There's less stocks going down, and that's a real positive sign. We're going to be speaking of that positive sign. The Dow up over 3% S&P not too far behind. Nasdaq up over 2.5%. Do you think today's gains does this rally that we're seeing have legs? Yeah, we think it does. I mean, there's lots of ways we can look at this. Right? I mean, I mentioned the VIX. You look at sentiment polls. We're near some of the most bearers we've seen, guys, since major lows, March 2009, March 2020. Expectations are so low. It's not like things are great. Believe me. We're going to see this earnings season, how corporate America is looking. Roptimistic earnings are still going to justify this economy growing. But expectations have just simply gotten so low. And let's not forget this. Believe the last 17 bear markets, six of them bottom in October. Believe me, it could be random. Maybe not. October is more of a bear market killer. The worst two starts year ever, other than this year, this is the third worst start, 74 in 2002. All right. Bottom in the first two weeks, two weeks of October. We just do it again. Believe me. Two in and watch later. We think we're optimistic that we can have another pretty good low in October. And then those regular fourth quarter strong seasonals that take place in a midterm year can take over. And we can have a pretty good size rally the rest of this year before the year is all said and done. And Ryan, how about the fact that it's a midterm election? Yeah, what are investors hoping for in this sort of environment? Yeah, great question. So let's put it this way. I think gridlock, right? You don't want too much power one way or the other. And you look at the way the election, how it might swing. You know the incumbent party that won the presidency, tends to lose some seats. But we don't think there's going to be too much power one way or the other. And that could be what matters. But for the average investor listening, just know this. We say do not invest in your politics, right? Just invest in the fundamentals. But think about this. If you looked at what the S&P did, the day of the midterm elections, go back to World War II. All right. One year later, the S&P was higher every single time, up 14.1%. So whatever happens, markets hate uncertainty. Get that election out of the way, the uncertainty out of the way. Then then markets tend to do pretty darn well. Last point on this, the second year of a new president. So this year, historically extremely weak. Believe me, this year is weaker than we expected. At the same time, this isn't abnormal to see weakness the second year of a new president. And things get a lot better that third year. And the economy can keep growing in our view. It should lead to pretty good sized gains into this year and into next year. Don't get me wrong, man. We love to see the rally. We love your positivity. You know that. But if I said dinner on the S&P being higher in one month than it is today, you'd say what? And that's an off. Where are we going for dinner is what I would say. I mean, okay. Some were expensive. Yeah, good steakhouse. No, higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,75,2022-10-13 19:20:54
3267," today you'd say what and that's an off. Where are we going for dinner is what I would say. I mean, okay. Some were expensive. Yeah, good steakhouse. No, higher. I mean, believe me. So let's put it like this. October and November are the top two months in a midterm year. We talked about some of those things. I mean, I know we know inflation's high, but overall, this beach ball is really low, right? Really, really low. Once you let go and that momentum go up, we think, you know, this time next month, you can buy me a steak. I'll come to New York. Yeah, we think that S and P is going to be a decent deal higher. I'd be happy to buy you dinner, man. If I lose this bet and that is a bet, it's on tape. Is there anything that you see then that tells us inflation might be cooling? Yeah, I mean, believe me, this number is disappointing. Yesterday's number is disappointing. But yes, you know, you look at some of the individual surveys like Rents. Rents are actually down month over month last year. The government data doesn't show that because government data takes like nine months for it to get in there. Use cars and really started coming back down. The government data doesn't show that because again, they're not as real time when it comes to this. So those are some potential positive. Just look around, right? Commodity prices have come back significantly. Again, so those are some shining, I don't know, I'm worried. Some potential bright spots in a really dark sea when it comes to inflation. But at the same time, what's priced in and what's not? The market is pricing in massive inflation, massively higher rates. The Fed is not infallible. This time, 15 months ago, the Fed saw one rate hike this year. All right. I'm not calling them out. I'm just saying that's what it was. Six months from now, I doubt if the Fed's going to be nearly as hawkish as they are right now. Well, Brian, when you take a look, I guess what we're going to see play out in the markets over the next several weeks. A big, important factor here is going to be earnings. We're starting that tomorrow. We're starting a number of the bigger earnings with some of the bigger banks we heard from Pepsi earlier this week. They were actually able to weather this in certain environment, high inflation very well. What are some areas, or do you think do you spot any trends just in terms of companies that are best positioned to weather some of the downturn that we could see, even though you have a pretty optimistic outlook here. Yeah, that's a great point. So earnings coming up, right? Energy is supposed to have massive earnings growth. We know that. But the number two is industrials. Industrial is supposed to see over 20% year-over-year earnings growth. You don't usually have a recession when that happens. And you look under the service of industrials on a relative strength basis, versus yes and P500. Industrials are breaking out to like one and a half year highs on a relative strength. So to see industrials that strong under the service with small caps, with gin violated, the gin lows, with healthcare hanging in there, with regional banks actually making new highs and relative strength, things are perfect. We get it. But these are some shining lights and some positives that are under there. And industrials to me is a really good looking group that could be a big winner this earnings season. So Ryan, then, for investors watching this, wondering what to make of this period between now and November, how should they be viewing the market? Where are the opportunities? Yeah, kind of hinted at some of them. So we like value over growth still, your industrials, your energy, those materials. I mean, those are some groups that still look pretty good to us. We haven't liked big cap tech for a while, more neutral at best. I just look at this multi-year running growth, right? And technology, some of these names still look kind of top heavy, honestly. So we like kind of small caps look pretty good in value. Those are some areas we still like. We're just big picture, this big bear market that we've had. We think this time six to 12 months or now, I know it's cliche to say, but there are some really good opportunities. Absolutely. That's small caps. Small caps are historically cheap, relative to large caps. That's another positive we think there. All right. Lots of great stuff. A big thank you, Ryan Dietrich, for joining us this afternoon. Have a good one. All right. Coming up, Netflix reveals what's included in its new basic with ads plan. We'll tell you if it stacks up against its rivals. And also be sure to tune in to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit Monday, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern time, GM CEO Mary Varra, Microsoft CTO, our CEO Satya Nadella are just two of the big industry leaders that will be joining the program.

3268," Picture Let's go. Netflix finally revealing the price of its ad supported tier Yahoo finances. Alexander Canal here with the details. Ali, what can you tell us a lot of the focus here on the price? A lot of focus on the pricing. Six dollars and 99 cents in the US. That's pricing is going to change depending on the country. Roll out in 12 different countries. The bulk of them will be rolling out on November 3rd except Canada, Mexico, November 1st. Users can sign up for this and in Spain, November 10th concludes that roll out. Now in terms of that $6.99 price tag in the US, Netflix told me on an earnings call, but a call prior to the announcement that they are not heavily anchoring the pricing based on competition, especially considering that Netflix Disney with ads cost $7.99. So perhaps a little bit more strategy there, but rather they said they want to provide that entertainment value. The company also shrugged off concerns when it comes to users. Potentially trading down to the ad supported tier, they estimated that total revenue will be neutral to positive with the comparable plan. And then in terms of these ads, how they're going to impact the user experience, four to five minutes of ads per hour with tight frequency caps. So basically they don't want users to see the same ads over and over again. Each ad will be 15 seconds or 30 seconds in length. It'll either be pre-roll or it will air in the middle of programming, which I probably am not going to be do keen about it by a user of this ad tier. But I did get a chance to preview some of these and it looks like the ones that are mid-roll are those on the shorter side about 15 seconds. Should be interesting to see the ad market when this rolls out. They also say Neil Sendata will be part of the next wave. Help or hurt the overall picture for Netflix. I think it definitely helps. Historically, Netflix has been a little bit coy when it comes to viewership that started to change once they began releasing their weekly top 10 list. So this is going to help advertisers really get a sense of the scale for some of these shows and how they can best program their ads within it. We saw Amazon recently partner when Neil Send for more clarity on Thursday night football. So this is something I think is going to be a net positive for Netflix. And I'm sure as soon as this rolls out investors, analysts alike, they're going to be closely watching this one, especially considering Neil Send is the main ratings tracker for a lot of those big cable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,77,2022-10-13 19:29:33
3269," Sure, as soon as this rolls out investors, analysts alike, they're going to be closely watching this one, especially considering Nielsen is the main ratings tracker for a lot of those big cable and broadcast television networks. So we're sort of entering this era where broadcasts and streaming are starting to converge. Yeah, and now, I mean, it's no surprise we know that Wall Street, I guess more broadly speaking, has been very bullish on the ad support to tear potentially what that could do in terms of subscriber growth going forward. But Rochelle was interesting that $6.99 price tag was a little surprising. I was expecting it to be a little bit cheaper given the fact that their base plan is at $9.99. I mean, I agree. I think they maybe didn't want to put people off too much. They didn't want there to be such such a big price difference. I actually thought it was a pretty good price myself. I'm still not willing to downgrade because I don't, I just don't like my things being interrupted. My time is precious. I think it was interesting that on the advertiser side though, they sold it on a fixed price basis first and they said that they nearly sold out all their inventory at launch. So at a time when we're seeing a lot of advertisers and marketers pulling back, this they seem to be all in on. Obviously you have a big target right there. I thought that was interesting. And Dave, what do you think? Are you willing to perhaps downgrade? Would you pay a little bit less to get the interruptions? Right, and that's really the big question. How does it change consumer behavior? And so we had a poll about what people would do with this $7 a month for the ad tier. How would it change your Netflix subscription? There's good news and there's bad news in here. The majority of you said you will not change. So that's the good news. I think the bad news is that only encourages 9% of you to join Netflix if you're not already. That is probably not the number that they are hoping for. Now this is a small sample size. For me, I'm in that majority. Yeah, I won't make any change based on a $7 per month price tag. My question is if this doesn't work, what's next? What's the okay then? Because they're not in sports. They're not in news. They said they're not going near it. They're not in merch. They don't have park. They don't have what Amazon or Disney or any of their competitors have. What next? Yeah, and I think that's a really big question that a lot of people are asking themselves. I think right now in terms of content, they should be focusing on buildable, franchise content. They spend a lot of money on these one-off movies that people could just watch and then give up. But what about the multi-series? What about, you know, if you look at something like a Game of Thrones and now they have the prequel House of the Dragon, they're starting to dabble in that a little bit, but I think they need more of that on the content side. And another thing I want to note just on the ad tier, another negative is that there's going to be a limited number of movies and TV shows that will not be available on the ad supported due to licensing agreements. They said it's a very small number. We don't know what. We don't know what. They said between 5 to 10% of overall programming, depending on the country, but that is a lot. And also, you can't download these shows on the ad tier because of technical complex. That is no small number. And if you want to play in, like, the amount of Netflix that I download. That may be the sole reason we have it. That is no small number. You know what? I was all in for downgrading for the ad supported tier. I know. I don't use it that often, but when you go to use it and not being able to have that, that is not a fine print. That is not fine print. That is not fine print. Yeah, that is not fine print. But it isn't going to be interesting to see, I guess, how many new subscribers they are able to get on board here. What you said just in terms of the amount of time for the ads, it was only a 30 second or 15 second mid-of-the-roll. Four to five minutes in an hour. I don't know. 15, 30 seconds. Yeah. It's not that bad, though. It's not terrible, but yeah, I am curious how many people will sign up. Well, we will see soon enough right, Alicanael. Thanks so much. Well, come here up next, Kroger, reportedly going shopping for a merger. We'll tell you who it might be. forbidden店.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,78,2022-10-13 19:34:07
3270," good It's time for Triple Play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got Proger, Delta Airlines and Digital World Acquisition Core. So my pick, a US grocery giant in the making with my pick, Proger, Ticket-KR, in talks to my rival Albertsons in an all cash deal according to Bloomberg. Proger shares, as you can see, that up about 1%, but look at Albertsons up more than 11%. Now that announcement is actually possible this week. Proger is the number two grocery seller with a 9.9 market share. You have Albertsons in fourth place with 5.7%, still a long way off to not warm up off the tops while they have more than 20% of market share, according to numerator. Now, if this deal goes through, it would be the largest US retail transaction in years, but it's a big if, though, as regulatory pushback is likely, according to Oppenheimer, due to some of these overlaps in West Coast states, including California and Washington, and also in big metro areas, including Vegas, Phoenix and Chicago, according to Churchill Capital and let's Nick Papas. He also has some rural areas where there aren't that many grocery stores, and they would be the dominant player there. Now, when you have high inflation, we were talking about food prices being up 11%, these sorts of merges have already drawn scrutiny from the Biden administration, so sure we'll have to be keeping a night on this one to see if it goes through. Yeah, I think the regulatory question is here, is really center here, whether or not is going to get approval. If, in fact, we do see this deal happen, it is expected to happen before the end of the week, just leaving tomorrow for it to be announced. I think operationally, the feedback, at least from the street, right away, has been that that would make sense, but of course, the approval process, that is really what is hanging in the balance right now. In terms of how big they are, Proger is already the largest supermarket operator ahead of this potential deal. It has a $32 billion market cap, Albert sends 15 billion, so we do see that combination certainly could potentially change the grocery landscape across the country. All right, my pick today is Delta, the stock jumping after reporting a profit, $695 million for the third quarter, higher fairs helping offset those rising jet fuel prices. Now the carrier also offered upbeat fourth quarter guidance, noting a resurgence in corporate travel and signs of a big holiday rush as two of those driving factors. Now CEO Ed Bashin telling Yahoo Finance earlier that he doesn't see consumers pulling back on spending.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,79,2022-10-13 19:38:49
3271," in corporate travel and signs of a big holiday rush as two of those driving factors. Now CEO Ed Bashin telling Yahoo Finance earlier that he doesn't see consumers pulling back on spending in terms of travel because of inflation. Rather, he says that they are quote, prioritizing investing in themselves, experiences and services rather than buying things. Despite the near-term positive momentum, though, Raymond James did caution that the lack of detail 2023 guidance is quote, unlikely to switch any investor cost concerns amid labor, fuel and broader macro concerns. Dave, when you take a look at the numbers, initially looking very positive here for Delta, I thought that that point from Raymond James was pretty important here as we go into this uncertain time of potential pullback here in 2023, too much uncertainty to give that detailed guidance. It does make you. I guess wonder how bad. It's just no pullback insight. We also saw on the inflation print today up 8% airfare is month to month and up 43% year over year when you combine the inflation report with the Delta earnings and they're showing no demand destruction. I don't know, man, this is a lot like Pepsi. We just don't see people stopping, traveling, stopping buying some of these consumer staples. The airfare's united was up on this. JetBlue was up on this. American was up on this. All 3 plus percent on the day. So good news for the entire sector. My play is digital world acquisition. Corp shares of the blank check company jumping big time today on news. Former president Donald Trump's truth social media platform will be allowed on the Google Play Store. That covers 44% of all smartphone users who of course have Android devices. It had been banned prior. According to Google, though, truth social agreed to enforce content moderation and to remove and block users who publish posts that insight. Violence, DWAC is currently pushing to extend the deadline for the merger with Trump media currently set for December 8 without the extension or the completion of the merger. They will be forced to liquidate shares are down 94% in the last 12 months, but they are up today. We mentioned the balance 14 plus percent. This on the very day that the House had another public hearing on the January 6th insurrection. They're voting this afternoon to see if they'll deal subpoena Donald Trump. Of course, we'll never see him at these hearings. It'll kick way till after midterm until delay this forever. I'm stunned at this increase, though, Michelle. I give this deal a true social no chance. My perception is deals never changed. I just cannot see a path to success. Not sure about you. Now, I mean, and when they talk about the extensions, we heard from DWAC CEO Patrick Orlando. Basically, he's already said, if they don't get more of these extensions, the deal is going to fall apart. A lot of people were wondering now that this Twitter deal with musk is supposed to go through. Do you still need DWAC? Will you already have a platform? For some of these ones that perhaps sprung up because of the limitations of Twitter, even though there is some hope, obviously, with it being in the Google Play Store, if there's no deal, it doesn't really matter if the app makes it to the Play Store. I think the performance has just been so rough here going back year today with the stock off 64% of these investors are just looking for any sort of good news, which is why we're seeing the pop today. But I'm with you. I really don't think that this excitement in this is going to last. All right, coming up next, the price of grocery rising once again in September. We'll tell you just how much prices are jumping next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,80,2022-10-13 19:42:18
3272," Music We're keeping an eye on the oil and energy markets, especially after that hot CPI report showed that the energy prices were up nearly 20% in September compared to a year ago. A very own inesphere is hit with a closer look. And that's what are you seeing? Well we're starting watching oil prices today. We did see a bump in those. You're looking at WTI that's up more than 2% settling at $89.11 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent Crude settled at $94.50 a per barrel up 2%. Earlier this week, oil prices had been lower over concerns of further rate hikes. So energy prices increased 19.8% in September of that CPI print that you just talked about. That's compared to a year ago, month over month, energy prices declined by 2.1%. And just looking at those components, you had the gasoline index which fell with the natural gas and electricity indices those rows. Shell. I'll find a says inesphere. Thank you for that update. Shona. Well speaking of higher prices, your grocery bill just keeps going up inflation data out today showing September at home food prices up another 7% of a percent on a monthly basis, bringing that year over year surge to just around 13%. And taking a look at some of these costs here, the price of bread jumping 14.7% from a year ago, eggs up more than 30% coffee up nearly 16%. Butter, a pastagorean 26%. Let's bring in Bill Baruch, Blue Line futures, President Bill, when you're looking at prices like that, you have to think it can't keep going up, but it seems to just continue to trend to the upside. Is it going to get even more expensive from here? Well, the sad news is, food prices in the grocery store tend to be some of the most sticky. And once they move those prices up, they may not come back down. But it's going to be a tough one here. And really, it's matters to what the crop looks like. And we're in harvest right now in the U.S., soybeans and corn. But we looked out the South America. They've had a tough planting season with very dry weather. And then, obviously, orange juice. Everybody loves their orange juice. And it could be the worst crop in 80 years. So there's a lot of questions behind that. And that's something that we have Blue Line. We put a lot of agriculture research out daily. And that's something we were poking to back when the Russian invasion of Ukraine started was that these prices had moved up. But once they came off, it was a matter of, you know, what is the U.S. crop look like? There are other factors in the world that are going to impact these prices rather than just the war in Ukraine, which is the bread basket of the global economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,81,2022-10-13 19:47:07
3273," world that are going to impact these prices rather than just the the the war in Ukraine, which is the bread basket of the global economy. Yeah, you know, and we've seen some dent in demand with House and we've seen some dent in demand with used cars, but food is unlike all these things. Of course, fruits and vegetables surged 1.6% for the month. What will bring these prices down if you're the Fed? You know, I think if you're looking at it from the Fed's standpoint, I mean, they they are concerned with the food prices. They are concerned with this stickiness here, but the real question when we're looking at Fed policy and where it's going, the direction it's going, it's it's going to be really rely on OER. The owner's a little bit rent and that's the one third of CPI. It's been extremely sticky. Does it roll over at some point in quarter one? And that could really be the sign that inflation has top. That's that's going to be the question and that's going to allow the Fed to to live their foot off the gas. I mean, you could also you got an interesting move here in the market where where you have the equities and then really commodities have begun to follow and really all sets started with the US dollar. The US dollar spiked on on the hot CPI number, but once the US dollar came off, it's allowed for a relief of downward pressures and stocks in commodities. And so once you get this move back up, you're actually you're reflating these assets. Now, not at this level, but does the move continue and that's something we've been noting at the like futures too is the potential blowoff top in the US dollar really began about two weeks ago at the end of September with with the UK move and how the cable had fallen out of bad and you know the end of the euro were already pretty weak, but when you get sharp reversals like that in the US dollar that began in potentially a lower high right now, we could be at the start of a top in the dollar which will stoke prices and your grocery bill make it to be higher, just simply because of commodities being priced and dollars will rise. Bill, when we're trying to figure out I guess how much higher just in terms of percentage, are we talking a couple of percent? Are we talking a huge jump that we could potentially see? What do you think? Huge jump in the average food prices at the grocery bill. Well, you know, if you look at things, I saw an anecdote of a I saw on Twitter somewhere and I wish I could credit the person that tweeted it or retweeted it, but it was a picture of a bakery and a picture out of bakery and the baker had put a list of every ingredient and the cost. And everything across the board from granulated sugar to flour to powdered sugar to eggs, everything was doubled to maybe even almost triple the price. So you're seeing things, those prices that he's stating, I'm sure he's buying it as some sort of wholesale or, but you're looking at prices that have increased dramatically much more than what you may see in these CPI numbers. So the real hard cost that's hitting home is much more and that's the problem. And even different distortions that have taken place throughout the year, I mean, there's been different sort of different fires at different, different meat processing plants, outages at meat processing plants, chicken farms, things like that have also had an impact. And it's really odd to see that such a wide number of those taking place, but there's been, you know, these sorts of distortions that are taking place in this post-pandemic world that have also stoke prices higher. Want to quickly pivot to energy? We saw some relief there in the inflation print, but of course, that number's lagging and gas prices now up to 391 from 370 a month ago, where they headed. Well, you know, we've been extremely bullish energy for a, for really since June, June of 2020. And it's something that we put out research every single day at Blue Line Futures. And I personally write about the S&P, the NASDAQ, crude oil, and silver and gold. And specifically for crude oil, we've always had a bullish tone. We actually went neutral when crude oil did break below $93 back in August. I think it was August, you know, early September. And at that point, we said, you know, look for $75. $75 could be the floor. We traded down to 76 to crude. And we've responded off this massive level of support that really a cleansing, if you will, of prices. I mean, a lot of people from a trading perspective.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,82,2022-10-13 19:51:03
3274," and we've responded off this massive level of support that really a cleansing, if you will, of prices. I mean, a lot of people from a trading perspective got, you know, sort of ingrained that crude oil by the dip, by the dip, and you're going to get paid, continue to buy the dip, and we needed a little bit of a cleansing. It really wasn't that much of a cleansing, but it allowed some relief and for the price of crude oil to go higher. Now we're back, you know, in roughly $90, let's call it, although we're a bit below here today. It really matters, you know, with OPEC taking production offline. I don't think that, you know, the headline drop of two million barrels per day in their production was, is the actual impact. It's more like 900,000 barrels per day, but it's definitely created some geopolitical tensions, which I think could stoke the price of oil higher. However, I'm not extremely bullish right now. And I've actually put a neutral tone in our research because they do think with the White House right now they're throwing the kitchen sink to try and keep prices suppressed. I don't think this is a good thing. And I think it's going to hurt in the end. But in the near term, over say the next month, you have this expiration of the November futures contract coming up next week, and then you get to the end of the month and then in midterm elections. I think that the White House will continue to release SPR and sort of go face to face here with Saudi Arabia. That could keep prices suppressed in the near term. And I think that would just be a tremendous buying opportunity back on your 80 bucks if we get it. Yeah, prices above four bucks by the midterms, bad news for the Biden administration. All right, Bill Baruch, Blue Line futures. Good to see you, Matt. Thank you. Coming up, Apple and Goldman Sachs are teaming up again. Stay tuned to hear what they're offering you. Next. Next. Next.

3275," We're seeing obviously Apple going even further with this ecosystem. We're really trying to make sure they're tapping to every part of your life. What do you think about this move? No, I love me some Apple pay. I do. I'm addicted. I use it every day for multiple times a day. I do think it is smart. We know that Apple has been focused on their services segment. This obviously would be a next. I guess pushed us into the whole payment space. There are rumors also that it's coming out with an affirm competitor in terms of buy now, pay later that they'll reportedly be pushed to next year. I think the interest though that's going to be offered is going to be key to this. Like Rochelle just said Dave, we don't have any details just in terms of what exactly that's going to be. Bangra did take a look at some of the competitor offerings out there saying that they're in the 2.2 percent to 3.05 percent range. It makes sense. I don't know how widely used it's going to be, but I think it's a natural step here for Apple. Initially, maybe not, but long term, I think this is huge upside for Apple and frankly, no downside for you, the consumer. I mean, there's no annual fee. There's no minimum deposit. There's no balance requirement. So what is the downside? You're going to have this dashboard on your phone that shows you the cash back. You're getting into your account. So it's kind of an immediate gratification thing. And to your point, services is where it's all about. We talk a lot about iPhone sales, but services, music, Apple TV, cloud, news plus. Fitness plus and now banking and the other side of this we haven't talked about is the Goldman Sach side of this, which is interesting. They become more like a conventional bank in this aspect and have access now to consumer deposits, which changes the whole picture for Goldman Sachs and all upside in that regard too. So hard to think of a downside other than more information that we're giving to Apple, but at this point, we're throwing in that. Yeah. And you're right to point out it is a huge win for Goldman too. They have clearly been working on growing their markets business. It hasn't grown on, I don't think as maybe as quickly as some had initially anticipated that it would be now that this gives them more exposure, exposure here to consumer deposits, which is a huge win for Goldman in that consumer push for show. I mean, as you bring up markets there, when you think of how many iPhones and people's pockets, the sort of collaboration here, I mean, this is a huge win, I think for both sides. So one will definitely be keeping an eye on. Alright, coming up, we're counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street.

Let's bring in Jared Blyckery to break down the glowing market action because of course we rally on bad inflation prints. That's what we do, man. That is correct. But I'll tell you what, this is actually good news. Actually bad news is good news. We're going to figure that out. All right, I want to show you the NASDAQ here. That is up over 2 and 1 third percent. But you really get a feel for what happened today if you look at the futures. This is the S&P 500. Just want to show you that. Was that dip on CPI? And this is what a recovering rally looks like. Now, if you take a year-to-date look on the candlesticks, I just want to show you this huge green candle down here. You can see it even better on this three-month chart. Wow, that is a reversal. I went back in history. The last time we got a new 52-week low and a big upside reversal closing up, 2 percent and more. Bunch of these caught the bottom in a bunch of bear market. So I'm going to be writing this up for tomorrow. You guys watch out for it. In the meantime, I want to leave you with a few heat maps here. Here's a sector action for today. Those value stacks up more than 4 percent energy and financials. Tech also up more than 3 percent and materials right there with them. Those are all the outperformers. I'm just going to show you what the NASDAQ 100 looks like on a good update. There you go. Apple up 3 percent. So is Microsoft Tesla up 2 percent, guys. And here's the closing bell on Wall Street on this Thursday. Right before my birthday. We hope Jared's birthday does help the good news here. Continue with the rally on Wall Street. Now of 825 points, this would be up 2.6 percent NASDAQ up just over 2 percent today, a huge reversal from what we saw shortly after the opening year. You look at some of the sector action that we're seeing today. All 11 of the S&P sectors moving to the upside, some of the largest gains coming from energy, financials and technology. So you're going to take a closer look at the action that we saw today. Let's bring in Ross Bayfield, Baird Investment Strategy, analyst. We also have Joanne Fini, advisors, capital management partner and portfolio manager. Great to see both of you. Ross, let me start with you just in terms of the reversal that we saw today. The bad news is good news here for the market. What do you make of it? Well, look, I'm a long-term bull. I'm an optimist, but reading that CPI report, I found it difficult to find any good news. Core CPI accelerating, broadening out. Presents a real problem for the Federal Reserve. So to me, maybe this was a sell the news type of event or just a sentiment positioning reversal, but it doesn't change the path of the Fed. It doesn't change what they have to do over the coming months. So maybe a lot of it was priced in getting near those 2022 lows. However, it's hard to find a lot of good news out of the CPI report this morning. I'll take the good day when we can get it, but maybe if there's good news, you can tell where it was. So, Joanna, hopefully you can help us figure this out, given how much stickiness we saw in this CPI report. Well, you know what? When I was a kid, he played Twister, and you have to be pretty skilled at Twister to figure this one out, I think. But bending over backwards a little bit, one can imagine that this print showing how resilient and broad inflation is and the challenges of the labor shortage and wage pressures does make it very clear that the Fed has to be adamant about solving this problem. It gives the Fed no wiggle room, which means that the Fed is going to raise rates and continue to raise rates until it solves the problem. Now, for the long term economic health of the United States, that's a good thing, because it really means that we're going to get this inflation problem under control. The Fed's not going to have an opportunity to pull.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,85,2022-10-13 20:04:02
3277," long-term economic health of the United States, that's a good thing because it really means that we're going to get this inflation problem under control. The Fed's not going to have an opportunity to pause or to go light. So that might be something that's convincing investors that, okay, the Fed has no choice. They're going to have to solve this problem. Not going to be any wiggle room. There's no chance they're going to pause and make a mistake. You know, so a longer term, it could be that investors are saying, okay, the bad news is all in at this point. There's no room to maneuver around this. Fed's going to have to go raise rates. They're going to solve this problem. Longer term, we're going to have inflation come back towards that 2% target, and that's going to be good for the ultimate economic growth of the United States economy, which means maybe it's time to get into these companies that ultimately are going to do well in a healthy economy. We know there's a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines, and we've seen it before over the summer with these little tentative dips and rallies. It's a time to get back ending to own these stocks because a lot of them have gotten cheap. So I think it's partly all the cash that was sitting on the sidelines. And now I think it's conviction that the Fed will have no choice but to be adamant and determined about solving the inflation problem. And ultimately, that's good for the long run health of the U.S. economy. Dre, I'm outstanding at Twister. Far be it for me to solve this riddle, though. I can not even begin to explain that rally, but there is some optimism in your voice. Ross, do you see any opportunity? Yeah, absolutely. We'll look with sentiment as negative as it's gotten. Positioning as negative as it's gotten. Valuation, both in fixed income and in stocks, approaching something like we haven't seen in quite some time. I think there's some real opportunity if you're a long-term investor to start lagging in to, if you want to average in during this volatile time. So yeah, there are sectors we like, sectors that we think have tougher roads ahead, but overall, if you're a long-term investor, we haven't seen a starting point like this in quite some time. Now, it might be a rocky road in the near term, but we're long-term optimists. So if you want to look at sectors, energy leading to that, I think is a really good example of a sector that's been leadership that has a really good trend is going to have some really good earnings quarters over the next few quarters. On the flip side, the fact that the Nasdaq trail today, I think is emblematic that some of those big tech names are still a lot to work through before they become kind of the tech names that were used to over the last decade again. Joanne, you teased some of your picks too. Give us it inside scoop. What do you like in this market? Yeah, so when you're potentially heading into a recession, even if it's not so severe, something we've seen in the past, right? One way to help your portfolio during a time when some stocks are going to be weaker, they're going to be more aligned on consumer spending in the short term, is to move towards stocks that have the growth opportunity that's really structural. We still need more data centers. We still need more internet capacity. There's a lot more use of the internet from not just consumers, but firms, IOT devices, whether that's cars or factory equipment. So that's something that still needs lots of investment. And so the company's that enable that, whether it's parts or chips or software, cybersecurity is another area, which is going to be under continued pressure. Palo Alto is one of our favorites in that cloud data center space, whether it's a Broadcom or an Amazon. I know it wasn't one of the ones that rallied today, but they're a critical provider and it's mostly traded down on the retail side. And then you can go to a real contrary and play and look at home builders. Because the fact of the matter is with rental costs so high as we saw in the CPI print, people have to live somewhere and this millennial generation needs housing. And as rents get more expensive, that makes housing even with high mortgage rates, you know, something that becomes more palatable. What we're seeing is them trade down, getting rid of some of the extras on those new homes and buying something cheaper to help offset the high mortgage rates. So we really like Lunar. It's trading at 5.8 times. And we think that, you know, you'll be real happy with that kind of purchase over the next three, you know, three plus years and potentially even sooner. And Ross, I know you said you take the longer the, but for some people who perhaps have a short a time horizon, where do you see opportunities? I mean, near term, I think the volatility is likely to continue and we are headed towards some sort of economic slowdown. I mean, that is the intention of the Fed, whether it's a soft landing or a hard landing, you know, there is a slowdown coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,86,2022-10-13 20:08:29
3278," are headed towards some sort of economic slowdown. I mean, that is the intention of the Fed, whether it's a soft landing or a hard landing, there is a slowdown coming. And so you want to position defensively and you want to position with leadership. Now, it's kind of a more near-term tactical view of it. Again, I actually think at these rates, at these yields, treasuries, some investment grade debt, starts to look really attractive. But on the equity side, like I said, I think energy is leadership. I think being a little bit more defensive in the near-term probably makes some sense because the Fed will continue to raise rates at least into the first quarter of next year. Inflation, as it proved today, is broad, is still a problem. And so we're headed towards a slowdown, even if milder by historical standards. And we think that's the case, given where the labor market is and given the consumer position. It's still a slowdown. There still will be some contraction of earnings. And so you want to position for that in those kinds of sectors. And certainly the Fed, not going off course, especially with this latest CPI data. A big thank you to our market panel, Ross Mayfield and Joe Anfini. Thank you so much. All right, well, the January 6th committee has voted to subpoena form of President Donald Trump for both testimony and documents. It's his, in his final hearing before the midterm elections, the committee played dramatic, never-before-seen video of what was happening as members of Congress sought safety. Take a listen. There has to be some way we can maintain the sense that people have that there's some security or some confidence that government can function and that we can elect the president of the United States. Do we go back into session? We think go back into session, but now apparently everybody on the floor is putting on a three-guest mask to prepare for a breach. We're trying to get more information, putting on their tear gas masks. We also learn this afternoon, the Supreme Court rejected Trump's request to intervene in the fight over the classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago property. Now, there were no dissents. All right, coming up, mortgage rates hit a 20-year high but didn't even more pressure on home buyers. That's it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,87,2022-10-13 20:12:37

3280," that the supply picture will improve with builders earlier this year in the first six months, really ramping up construction of single-family homes. But they have gotten obviously a naturally spooked by the developments in the market, the pullback on the buyer side. So they are cutting back on single-family. They are actually continuing with the multi-family side. But for home sellers, the interesting picture is after roughly two months May and June where we saw new listings on realtor.com pick up. We've actually seen them retreat. It seems that for a lot of homeowners, they are worried that they have missed the peak of the market and many of them are holding back. And I'll add there is a seasonality component, right? We are past the peak market activity. Summergenesis, most volume and naturally fall in winter. We see a slight fallback from that. But by and large, I think for a lot of sellers, the real concern right now is if they are looking for a trade-up home, they're paying higher price plus a lot higher mortgage rates. So that might end up locking in effectively a lot of potential sellers over the next few months. Is the Fed going to break something in the housing sector, George? Well, the Fed is already, and we heard Jerome Powell already say that its intent is to significantly cool housing, right? He used the words housing correction is needed because the over competitive pace we signed 2020-2021 have put a lot of people on the sidelines. So I think as far as the Fed is concerned, the correction we're seeing in housing in terms of demand pulling back, medium prices are already coming down from their summer peaks. These are in a sense, is the very prescription the Fed is trying to apply to housing and bike extrapolation, the economy. I think for a lot of market watchers, the question is, has the Fed done enough, at least based on CPI not yet? And so, you know, the Fed do too much, right? Can we have too much of an over correction? And I think the jury is still out on both accounts. So the Adelec had balanced the Fed trying to make their due a graduate from Realtor.com. Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. All right, well, Social Security's cost of living adjustment for 2023 will increase 8.7 percent as the largest gains since 1981. Now, who finances Kerry Hanon joins us with the details, Kerry, what do we need to know? Well, I'm telling you, this is a big bump up. It's really going to allow Social Security recipients to tread water a bit better, right? I mean, we've seen this big bump up and inflation this year. This will make a big difference in their checks starting in January. Again, this will be, you know, for the average check, maybe $140 in each monthly check will be a bump up for an average one. And so it's really important to focus on this as something that a lot of people think of retirees living on a fixed income. Well, guess what? Social Security is not fixed. It is adjusted for inflation. So even though it's a little backwards looking, moving forward into 2023, we'll be seeing some breathing room. Let's say they're going to get some breathing room. And Michelle, you partner this with the Medicare, the dip in the premiums for the Plan B premiums coming up in 2023. And that's a nice little boost for retirees looking at what has been a tough year this year in pain for groceries and rent and gasoline and all those other things. So this is welcome news. And Carrie, speaking of high inflation, I bonds, I want to bring this up because of rates on I bonds, even though they have been very strong here, they're expected to drop. What can you tell us about that? Yeah, yeah, good one. Because they are tied to this whole issue that the equation gets out now. We're not going to know officially until November 1st, because they get adjusted twice a year, May 1st, November 1st. This what the analysts I talked to today said, now right now through the end of October, these I bonds are paying 9.62 percent. But what we're looking at moving forward for that November 1 number based on the CPI numbers, which goes into that equation, is around 6.4 percent. Could be 6.5. But what happens is, and the Treasury is suggesting, if you go to Treasury direct right now, they're saying try to get that, you know, lock in by the 28th of October so that you have your bond in hand by the 31st. But here's the good news. You'll get paid for the first",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,89,2022-10-13 20:21:27
3281," you know, lock in by the 28th of October so that you have your bond in hand by the 31st. But here's the good news. You'll get paid for the first six months that you hold that bond, that old rate, that 9.62 percent. And then after that, the next six months, say it is the 6.4 that we're looking at, you get the combination of the two, which I'm telling you, it's pretty attractive. It could be like, say, 8 percent for the year. So this is something, as I often say, this is a not a sexy investment, but it is a safe investment. Certainly an investment that has really gained popularity here over the last several months. I'm sure we will continue to talk about it. Carrie Henning, thanks so much for joining. Well, coming up, Amazon's slew of smart devices aim to make your home life easier, but they also collect a lot of your data. Stay tuned to hear just how much next. Amazon's second prime day event of the year or prime early access sale as retail giant is calling it has concluded and the numbers are in. Now, according to market research site numerator, the two day sales all nearly 45,000 prime orders from almost 19,000 households. Now, the average spend on those orders was around 100 bucks with most households placing just one order over those 48 hours. This site also broke down purchases by category with household essentials being the most popular, comprising 29 percent of purchases and health and beauty and apparel and shoes that coming in second and third respectively. About 29 percent of shoppers say that they use the sale to buy holiday gifts with Amazon gift cards being the most popular item.

3282," While you might soon be able to be unboxing some of these new shiny Amazon devices, the online retail giant slew of smart home devices are collecting a treasure trove of data from its millions of customers. So what does Amazon know about you and what's it doing with that information? What you're joining us now to discuss this is Washington Post Technology Colomest, Jeff Fowler. Go to have you on the show. Obviously, even when we were looking at the data, 12% of the purchases made there for Amazon Prime on these smart devices, I got a ring, I've got an echo. What does, what information did these devices collect for Amazon? Well, are you ready to get a little creeped out because I spent the last couple of weeks just trying to tally it all up. You know, I'm a tech columnist and I have many of these products in my own home where I've used them over the years. So I just tried to add it all up and I made a little list to share with you just to the top level here is Amazon. If you get their dream home, if you buy all their gadgets, they'll gather data about you when you're talking, when you're sleeping, when you walk by them, when you show your face, when you cough, when you snore, when you come home or leave home, when you turn on the lights, when you turn up the heat, when you play a music, when you watch TV, I mean, I could keep going and going and going with this list. The point is, you know, Amazon has pushed much further than any other big tech company, not only to make devices for this smart home, but also to make sure that they're collecting data out of them that they can use for their own purposes. I have to point out, Jeff Bezos happens to own the Washington Post. So it's listening to you right now, maybe the bosses. After knowing all this, do you still have an Amazon smart device plugged in in your home and what was the most concerning form of data that it is recording? Yeah. So I think the one that is the most popular in America is the Echo speaker. It's in fact one of the best selling speakers of all time. I do have something in my house. I'm a little bit unusual because I'm the tech guy for the Washington Post. So my job is to have all the things. So I also have the Apple one and I have the Google one. In terms of what is the most disturbing kind of information, for me, it's the stuff where Amazon just doesn't even give you a choice for them to collect all this data and to keep it, for example, their ring, doorbells and security cameras. They used to tell people that, oh, you're totally in control of what happens with that data. But we've now learned that there are about a dozen cases so far this year where Amazon has just handed over that footage to police without the permission of their owners. So I think stuff like that is really the areas where people Americans are going to get kind of upset here. So Jeff, two things, is there something that people can opt out of or if they're not comfortable with that? And also, from what I understand, Amazon doesn't sell the data. So then what are they actually doing with it? Yeah, so two really good points. This is sort of what Amazon always likes to say. It's actually lines that they borrowed from Facebook before, right? Facebook also doesn't sell our data. Yet they seem to have done plenty of use for it. And they, you know, Facebook also offers you lots of little opt out buttons. The truth is the default matter and the defaults for many of Amazon services just collect a lot more data. They just know that you're not going to bother to go in and change the setting that tells them not to keep recordings of stuff that goes on in your house, for example. So yes, you can do it. And in fact, we made a guide at the Washington Post as our privacy research guide, or we'll like walk you through a bunch of the settings you can adjust for Amazon to get them to collect less data. But you know, most people really just aren't going to take the time. And that's kind of the problem. And now they've got this $140 halo rise, which tracks your breathing during your sleep. God knows what else to what end? What do you think Amazon is trying to accomplish here? You know, Amazon is, it understands that data is power. You know, it's the oil of our economy. And with all of this data about our lives, they can do a lot of stuff. Many of their more recent acquisitions, in fact, have involved, and products have involved their bodies, right? They're trying to buy one medical, they bought a pill pack, the pharmacy company, products like the halo, and they also have the halo tracker or gather data about their body. One of their visions is to become kind of the AI doctor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,91,2022-10-13 20:30:07
3283," products like the Halo, I mean also the Halo tracker are gathered data about their body. One of their visions is to become kind of the AI doctor and to be able to do that, to be able to provide useful information to people, they just need to know a lot about our bodies. So we are giving it to them. In some cases, we're paying them to let them gather data about us, but they can then analyze and try to use and sell back to us later. It makes me feel even worse. We've talked about Echo and Ring, but even things like smart blinds. For people who are sort of ring comparisons with things like SkyNet and wondering where does this go from here? When it is, where does it is, in terms of AI and robotics, you've got your room being now nosy as it's vacuuming your house. How should consumers take this? What should they take away from this report? Yeah, I think a couple of things. First of all, everybody's going to have to make their own decisions about what they're comfortable with a company knowing about them, and also what they're comfortable with one of the largest corporations in human history knowing about them. Amazon should get some pressure back from us for those of us who think that it's collecting too much and storing too much, and they should be hearing this. So I hope they're listening to our conversation here today, because I think a lot of their customers feel this way. The other thing is, they don't have to design their products this way. We're often kind of given false choices as tech consumers that, you know, well, you know, either they're going to take all our data or we won't get to live in the future. And it's just not true. They don't have to design their products. And in fact, some of their competitors have not, if you look at the way that Apple, for example, handles a lot of smart-hung devices and data, they work very hard to make sure that they're not storing it, that they're not keeping it. So I think it's really just about us as consumers pushing back and saying, hey, we have some rights here to Amazon. Of course, everybody wants your data, including meta who roll down this new VR headset, $1500, you got to try this thing out. Your thoughts on it, and your thoughts on the metaverse, where we are right now. Yeah. Well, since we were just talking about privacy, I'll tell you the one eyebrow-raising thing about this new headset, is that it contains a whole bunch of cameras now on the inside that are looking at your eyes or eyebrows or cheeks, your mouth, you name it. And it's kind of a lot of information to know about our bodies. And I was really not satisfied with meta's answer about how they were going to keep that data private. So they say they're going to process it on the device, but they're still letting apps have access to it. So the question is, are we in a near future? Let's say you're watching Netflix, and Netflix could gather data about when you laugh at certain points in the show or when you're crying, because that's the kind of thing that this technology will enable. On the metaverse more broadly, it's been seven years since the first Facebook Oculus product came out of the Rift. I reviewed that at the time, and when I was sitting down looking through the six demos that meta gave me of the new Quest Pro, I was kind of struck by, we haven't really gotten very far. I think the term I used in my review for the post was, it's the Metaverse. It just doesn't really push the boundary that far. It's never felt further away the idea that the metaverse is a place where lots of us in our normal everyday lives, where jobs and being creative are going to use this thing. It feels like they've really got a long ways to go. A long, long way to go. Wash your post tech columnist, Jeff Fowler. Great to have you, man. Appreciate it. You bet.

3284,84 Today's CPI friend came in hotter than expected at 8.2% but our senior column this Rick Newman has found some bright spots in today's report. Rick we have been asking so many guests over the last two hours to give us some good news no one's been able to do it so tell us what you think is good in this report. Well you have to squint a little bit but I've been paying a lot of attention to what's happening in transportation and if you look at what has happened with the inflation rate for new cars and especially for used cars the inflation rate is actually coming down. Remember when the price of used cars at the beginning of the year the annual inflation rate was like 45% for used cars and we were all like how did that happen? Well we know now that the price of used cars was surging by so much because there weren't enough new cars. There has been a persistent shortage of new cars available and that has a lot to do with the semiconductor shortage. That shortage is still there but it's getting worked out and we have seen the inflation rate for used cars come down from around 45% of an annualized rate earlier this year. The annual rate now is around 7.5% I think that's still too high but at least that situation is getting better and of course gasoline inflation has been improving but it seems like we've seen the end of the gas price decline and it's probably going to stabilize around $3.90. The rest of the report there are a lot of things going wrong and we are not getting the break in inflation that a lot of people have been hoping for. Yeah how big a concern is this for President Biden said today the report shows some progress against his fight against tire prices. Perhaps you explain what that progress is but how big an issue is this for Democrats? Remember just a couple of months ago Democrats in Congress passed an energy bill that they named the Inflation Reduction Act. I think one of the reasons that they gave it that actually silly name is that when inflation does come down inevitably it will they'll be able to say see we did that because we passed this thing called the Inflation Reduction Act. It worked. It was like magic. Without a doubt they hoped they would be able to say that by the time of the mid-term uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,93,2022-10-13 20:38:56
3285," They'll be able to say, see, we did that because we passed this thing called the inflation reduction act. It worked. It was like magic. Without a doubt, they hoped they would be able to say that by the time of the midterm elections, which are now less than a month away in on November 8th. And they can't. They cannot say that we have meaningfully brought inflation down. I mean, it's down about a little more than a percentage point from the high point it was at over over the summer, but an inflation at 8.2%. Nobody is going to declare victory on that. I guess the one thing Democrats can hope for is that the big declining gas prices has made people feel a little bit better that has corresponded with a minor uptick in consumer confidence and a similar small uptick in President Biden's approval rating. But it hasn't gone high enough. Biden's approval is around 43 or 44%. I think for Democrats to have a good shot at holding on to both houses of Congress, Biden's approval would have to be around 50% even higher. And he just is not going to get their by November 8th. So this is last inflation report we're going to get before the midterm elections. We are going to have one more employment report and we're going to have one more federal reserve meeting. But everybody now seems to think the Fed is is certain to raise by another three quarters of a point and other big height coming. So if inflation comes down, it's going to have to come after the midterms. Yeah, it's going to need gas prices to stay with a three in front of it as well. Rick Newman, good to see us. Sir, thank you. Diet and exercise is so pre pandemic. The new way to lose weight is through diabetes drugs, even Elon Musk tweeting his endorsement of the drug wagovie. What's the investor story behind this and other diabetes drugs in demand now? Michael Nadalkvic is the vice president of equity research at Cohen, good to see us. Sir, so novosy only company with FDA approval to market wagovie. They also make ozempic in that category. You have 130 dollar price target on novo. How much does that factor in what could be a game changer in weight loss? Yeah, so you know, novo Nordisk is one of the leaders in diabetes and they're really an execution story. Yeah, they market one of the marquee drugs and what's called the GLP one class. That's the drug ozempic that you mentioned, which is indicated for diabetes treatment. And this class of drugs, where as I mentioned, novo is one of the leaders is growing at a double digit rate. And that seems to be something we can expect for the foreseeable future. So based almost entirely on their prospects and diabetes, we think novo Nordisk is a company that investors should take a look at. In the meantime, they have this outsized opportunity in obesity treatment. And obesity is a market that at least to date has not materialized in a real way for various reasons, but we think that that is always to change and novo Nordisk is really the tip of the sphere and is well positioned to take advantage of what could be a multi billion dollar opportunity over the next few years. Yeah, Michael. And the govie is the marquee drug there. Yeah, Michael, give us a better sense just on when you talk about the massive opportunity there. How big it could be in five years from now. What more specifically do you think that number could potentially look like? So I'll actually defer in part to novo Nordisk guidance. So their ambition is to sell 25 billion DKK in 2025 that that's roughly five billion or so a little bit less in US dollars and obesity drugs. So, you know, that kind of brings estimates down to earth a little bit. If you look at just the number of people in the US and globally that have obesity or overweight, it's hundreds of millions. And so you can get to some eye watering estimates pretty quickly if you if you dial up the penetration rate. Historically, hurdle to penetration of these drugs has been payers and market access. We think that's beginning to change, but that will probably be a headwind that that brings estimates closer to where novo Nordisk's mind is for 2025 and beyond. Stunning number on our screen nearly 42% of this country is obese. I know you do not cover Eli Lilly, but the FDA did agree to a quick review of their competitive drug, which is Moongaro. Are they similar in makeup and how they work? And how does this change the cap the ceiling for novo? So I'll quibble just a little bit with your question there. You know, the FDA's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,94,2022-10-13 20:43:00
3286," Does this change the cap the ceiling for Novo? Yeah, so I'll quibble just a little bit with your question there. You know, the FDA is requiring two of the four phase three trials for the drug is called Terzepity from Lily before they'll review it for obesity. And those are already due to read out in kind of Q2, Q3 of 2023. So the it might not be all that quick, although it is quicker than perhaps it could have been. But you know, in a market like obesity, which is really nascent. And as I said, we think is beginning to materialize in a real way. You know, the phrase arising tide lifts all boats probably has never applied more. So Lily entering the market with Terzepity, which is a highly effective weight loss drugs, it acts similarly to the way that Novo Nordic we go. He does. It is perhaps slightly more efficacious, perhaps slightly less tolerable, though that's to be determined in real world use. It's probably good for both companies and we think there are more than enough patients to address with both drugs. Michael, what can you tell us just about the cost of these drugs? Yeah, so you know, we actually know the list prices. So we go, if you just as an example, as a list price around $1,500 a month. But if it's covered by your insurance, you would pay something well below that. You know, so out of pocket, we don't anticipate in the US at least it'll be a major out of pocket market for these drugs. They're probably to expensive. Very interesting. How do both of these work or all of these drugs in this category essentially appetites a presence and therefore really band aids that you'd have to stay on potentially indefinitely? Yeah. So they do work primarily through appetite suppression, although there's some other mechanisms where they provide health benefits. You should, if you're on one of these drugs, physicians should keep a patient on them indefinitely. And there's solid data that demonstrates that if the patient goes off, then the weight comes back. So that's how they're labeled. That's how they're intended to be used. We'll see in the real world what treatment durations actually look like. But it's not really a band aid in that sense. You know, obesity is an illness and these are drugs that are meant to treat that illness in a way that's very similar to diabetes where it's a chronic disease and they need to be treated chronically. Michael Nadelka, Vitch of a cow and thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate your insight. Yeah. Thank you.

Add the corn mustard Maggaret sophisticated Add the networking Amazon, Walmart and Target have already released their holiday hiring plans, but the news may point to signs of weakness in the labour market. Julia Pollack, Zyprakruti Chief Economist, joins me now as part of our career control series sponsored by Straight Talk Wireless. Julia, good to have you back on the show. So as we look at some of the trends that we've been seeing, so as we look at some of the trends that we've been seeing in hiring, leading up to the holidays, what does that tell us though? As we take a look back, as we take a step back and look at the overall market right now. Oh, I just... This is about the toughest environment that employers can be in for holiday hiring. So on the one hand, you have a situation where employers really don't want to be caught flat, but if they don't want to risk under hiring, when there's going to be a surge of demand, but they also are very concerned about the future outlook and the possibility of a downturn, and so they don't want to over hire. And so they're being a bit cautious and a little bit slow to kick off holiday hiring. And even as we look at the market, solid but supply constrained labour market, it's as it for crypto described, jobless claims are rising 9,000 to 228,000. What is your reaction to this job claims data and what this means for where we really are in the labour market? So layoffs and firings remain very, very low and that jobless claims number is incredibly low by historical standards. So there aren't yet too many layoffs taking place. In the most recent jobs report, we saw that job gains remain incredibly broad based over the past 12 months they've been broader than ever before. And yet there are some industries that are disproportionately affected by rising interest rates, by high inflation, by a strong dollar, and we are seeing some pain there. So for example, consumers are getting a little bit more wary about big ticket purchases. They can't dip into their house and use it as a piggy bank quite as easily anymore. And so car dealerships have shed jobs in the last month and so have building supply stores. So it's not easy to pay for your renovation by refinancing your house. And obviously as we talk a lot about things like hiring, freezes, job losses, we are seeing it in some sectors more than others as we talk about the tech sector often on here. But we're also seeing a lot more strategic hiring. So what are some of the more in demand positions and some of the really prime candidates that some of these companies are targeting right now? So this has been a very exciting time where because the labour market is so supply constrained, companies have had to streamline and centralise their hiring processes and revamp them quite dramatically. So companies are doing things like speeding up the time to hire. They're also increasingly posting jobs remotely and advertising them in multiple environments so that they can increase diversity and speed. Those are the two things that many companies are going for now. They're learning to hire for skills, not degrees and experience, and to sort of try to figure out who is going to be a good fit even if they don't fit the traditional mold. And they're having some success. These experiments are paying off and I think we're going to see innovations in hiring that improve the candidate experience and employee experience for generations to come. So talk about some of those innovations because on the one hand you have quiet quitting. You have a lot of people who could be lost in first up when they look at who perhaps could be most at risk. And you look at who's most at risk and where you see the future of work heading with innovation. What is that telling?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_2e_wGpQzc,96,2022-10-13 20:52:04
3288," A lot of people who could be, you know, lost in first up when they look at who perhaps could be most at risk. When you look at who's most at risk and where you see the future of work heading with innovation, what is that telling you? So this is a labor market where there is still an increase in remote work in parts of the economy where there's tremendous potential. That increase has huge implications for the geography of work in America. We're seeing people increasingly open to moving in our monthly zippercruder job-seeker surveys. They are also being pushed by inflation in rent prices to consider opportunities more broadly across the country. Employers are also looking at candidates and increasingly hiring regardless of location. So that's one exciting move where people are sort of moving around for opportunity. And then we're also seeing an increase in the extent to which employers are having to behave in their HR departments like sales teams and like advertising and marketing teams. They are being more proactive. They are finding candidates passive talent often. People before they even apply and actively reaching out to them in our most recent survey, 37% of Americans hired in the last six months said that they had been reached out to. They had been recruited by someone at the company. So the job found them, they didn't have to find it. Now I also want to get your reaction. Obviously the Labour Department proposing this shift in gig workers being classified potentially as employees. You also have boomers being sort of left out of this, of this research and people coming back into the workforce and how that could impact the economy. How do you see some of these potential changes impacting what we see in the labour force say in the next year or so? So gig work, you know, we see in all the research that has been done is very valuable for workers because of its flexibility and converting those jobs into permanent payroll positions while it would improve benefits and have many benefits would also reduce that flexibility. And so there are trade-offs and I think those will become sort of abundantly clear as we go down that path. When it comes to labour force participation, you know, primate workers, even women, encouragingly have mostly recovered, almost fully recovered. We've seen younger workers actually see a boost in their employment opportunities and we've seen participation rise among teenagers and among workers with disabilities. So some people have been given better opportunities before because employers are expanding their recruiting efforts and because jobs have become more inclusive with the rise of remote work. That said, older workers have left this economy in much larger numbers than in any prior recession. They were displaced in enormous numbers. They faced the largest barriers to returning and it seems as though they are no longer coming back in large numbers. So they will leave a permanent gap and make this labour market as it permanently supply constrained unless we find other sources of labour perhaps by raising immigration caps or by improving our education and training programs. So a lot of demographic shifts to keep an eye on there. Thank you for breaking that down for a studio bullet. Have a good afternoon. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right, my stock to watch tomorrow, JPMorgan Chase, the bank marks the unofficial start, the third quarter earning season, analysts expect earnings to come in at $2.88 per share, which is down from a year ago.

One analyst also warning the guidance for $23 will come in week. And it's just one of the major banks to report ahead of the open tomorrow.

3289," Think about it A couple of collabs are all the rage these days, but sometimes they need your help. Craft launching a website and a call to action. Where is the Mac dot com encourages the public to push McDonald's to add craft mac and cheese to the Big Mac? The site has a direct link to tweet at McDonald's with the hashtag where is the Mac craft saying in a statement quote, we believe that the time for change is now. And we are hopeful that America's most iconic burger, the Big Mac, will start to add the most important Mac of all. Rochelle, are you in or are you out? I like Mac and cheese. I don't want it in my burger. You put making a side dish. Do something. That's way too much. The Big Mac is already a lot adding Mac and cheese that I can't. That's too much for me. What about you, Sean? Way too much for me. Although I didn't know this until reading this article, craft put out a statement saying that for years we've seen our fans add craft mac and cheese to their burgers from the comfort of their home. So even though Rochelle, you and I aren't necessarily on board with this, it does seem like there is a group out there, a market for this. Maybe this is why it's gaining some traction. You're a huge Mac and cheese fan. Oh my God. I'm right on board with this. There are a few things in the world I love more than Mac and cheese out of a box on a burger on all in, but hot take. I've never had a Big Mac. So maybe this is my opportunity. If they add it, I will have it here on this set. I will hope they're listening because they want you as a customer. All right.

3294," percent year date, you have layoff sweeping the industry met a snap, you name it. And Rita saying the tech industry has learned a lot most notably staying focused. Here's what he said. Well, I think one of the good lessons is to stay very focused. I think one of the things that the call it the 10 plus years of bull market is allowed. Kind of like let's experiment with X, let's experiment with Y, let's experiment with Z. Let's just try lots and lots of things. And I think one of the things to say it is good to innovate. It is good to do new things. But let's go like intensely. It's almost like some of what we learn from Steve Jobs at launching at Apple is like focus on a couple of things that you're launching really intensely and trying to make them as good as possible. And I think that's that's kind of one of the lessons for investors and executives and employees. And in terms of, you know, don't don't don't kind of like spread out like spaghetti all across the field. Read it. Read is right on. And basically that is my take for this one. This great reawakening inside of tech suite. See, sweets is in fact happening. Wow, it's some kind of graphic right there. He's like I said, he's very right on in my view. Evolution is happening across across the tech industry. And he is right. You know, we have seen the past five years amazing technology is created. Absolutely full stop. But there's been a lot of things that tech has worked on that are money losing outfits that really have no reason of being created inside of tech companies right now in this environment as a tech company or really any company. You have to be focused and rally around a series or one or two key strategies that you can do really well and that you're known for really well in a strong, really in the marketplace. And I think read is right on here. So I'm looking forward to hearing more from read on Monday for all market summit. I almost forgot what I talked about, but nonetheless, I look forward to seeing you. And how much is that tech actually improving society and improving business as well? That's going to be a major question mark going forward from here, whether it's social media companies or chip companies or some of the cloud companies. All of that has a larger question to answer moving forward if it wants to continue to benefit from some of the accelerated growth that it's seen in years past. And perhaps that all priced into their future as well. Once we finally do see them move forward with some of that vision and strategy, you are going to hear more from that conversation with Reid Hoffman and our on Brian Saasie as well during the all market summit next week Monday. And a lot of other conversations. I'm also a lot of other exciting. All right, guys. Coming up. We've got some breaking news on the state of the consumer. Stay tuned for this. It's nice. All right.

3295,"cussion Welcome back, you're watching Got Who Finance Live. We've struck this the top of the 10 a.m. hour here, Brad Smith here with Julie Heimann and you're seeing Brian Sazi on screen there as well with 30 minutes into trade. Let's take it swiftly on over to Julie Heimann who's got some fresh news, breaking news and consumer sentiment as well. Yeah, consumer sentiment coming out better than estimated from the University of Michigan's October preliminary reading 59.8 is that reading 58.8 is what analysts had been, economists had been estimating it's also an increase from the prior month. They've heard conditions whoo, up better than estimated 65.3, economists weren't even looking for a reading above 60, their expectations though are lower. So people that feel good now but they don't expect that they're going to continue to feel good. 56.2 is that expectations number. The one year inflation number expectations ticking up to 5.1% and the five to 10 year inflation expectations ticking up to 2.9% are pretty fascinating here and also kind of in line with what we have been hearing right from corporations as well. So kind of a confirmation that just as Jamie Dimon said today, consumers are in good shape right now right. They're feeling good right now. The consumer balance sheet is in decent shape. People are spending. It's what's happening next that people are worried about. Yeah, exactly. To continue to uncertainty over future trajectory of prices, economies, financial markets around the world indicating a bumpy road ahead for consumers that all kind of laid out within the commentary on this as well, sauce. Yeah, just an interesting report and I would say just strange, shortened to the point better than expected. Doesn't really, I would say, job with the retail sales report but nonetheless a good read on the consumer. Welcome, Reid, for the consumer ahead of the start to the holiday. Shopping season, but let's get back under earnings season, which is now officially in full swing results from the JP Morgan city, Morgan Stanley and of course Wells Fargo. David Allison runs point on the Hennessy large cap financial fund. David, market has seemed, at least initially seemed to like some of these big bank earnings. Do you think that enthusiasm is justified? Well, I think the stocks have been down a lot. So the fact that they're up a little bit tells me that the world didn't come to an end again. So I think the stocks have been really bad. And so the fact that they're rebounding is sort of a sigh of relief. I think generally the fundamentals are good. I mean, obviously the margin is expanded because rates are moving up and there are primary beneficiaries of that. But what you're not seeing is any real credit deterioration. So you've had a massive move in rates. You've had a massive move in the market that has gone down that's taken money away. Sentiment is not great on Wall Street. And yet you don't really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession and the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,2,2022-10-14 14:04:37
3296," really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession in the end of the world that seems to be the talk every day. Yeah, I mean, the end of the world trade can at least from what I've been told. Only be right once, and you hope that we don't reach that point. But when you think about some of the activity, even that we're seeing here on the day as well, David, as the markets have slipped back into negative territory, there we had a moment ago, all three major averages in negative territory. After beginning the day, pretty strong, and what seemed like would be another add on to yesterday's momentum, even though it was a whipsaw day yesterday, as you kind of look into the rest of this quarter, what would you need to see in order to have some confidence that a bottom had been set in during this fourth quarter, going into what economists are expecting in a recession at the midpoint sometime, 2023? Well, my general broad thoughts are that we've had a pretty good move in rates. Two years ago, I think the two year was like 15 basis points, and now it's 4 plus percent. So I think we're through the bulk of the rating increases, meaning we're not going to go to 8 or 10% on the three-month T-build. That's my opinion. I think what we're heading into now is an earnings issue for all of the companies, not all of them, but enough of them. Obviously, the financials aren't seeing any earnings issues. There's concern that there will be that rates will go up, credit will kick in, loan demand will decline. And I think it would be interesting to see what happens the next couple of weeks as the non-financial start to report and tell you what's happening away from the financial economy. Again, the banks came into this downturn, very strong, very conservative. They haven't made, they don't want to make bad loans. They've got plenty of capital. They're benefiting from the rise in rates in the NIM. So this group is not really indicative of what's happening out there in the marketplace yet. Well, there are some hints of it, right? If you look at this, David, in JP Morgan, for example, yes, net interest income doing fantastically. But if you take out net interest income, revenue actually didn't do as well. They're raising their provisions for credit losses. They're seeing a decline in lending already. How much worse do you think some of those indicators, even if the banks are going to get worse? Well, I don't, you know, it's, I guess, is an investor in these stocks to be completely honest. I am looking forward to credit troubles. I am looking forward to higher rates. I am looking forward to the market getting very concerned about the health of the banking industry, because that's going to generate the opportunities for me to buy the better names and outperform on the way up. So, you know, that's the raw truth of what I do is, you know, I don't want what we have now to continue, because I can't really compete with the other companies in the marketplace that grow. They create new products. We need cycles for this industry to really make money for investors. And my hope, again, I've been doing this for 40 years. You know, I'm hoping we have a downturn. I'm hoping we have a recession. I hope we have higher non-performers that create lower stock prices that I can buy as the economy recovers, the Fed, if it's and all that stuff. Okay, so David, tell us. So what are the better names then? What are the ones that you're looking to get cheaper? What are the ones you're most excited about getting cheaper in this kind of tumultuous period? Well, the ones that are going to have credit problems, and I don't think the bigger companies are going to have that. They've just been too conservative, they're too liquid. So the smaller banks, the mid-tier banks, maybe not the real small ones, where they've made loans, the loans to deposits are higher, they don't have as much liquidity. If credit kicks in on a negative thing, then they'll hopefully go down a lot more and I'll be able to buy them. But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,3,2022-10-14 14:09:12
3297," or now be able to buy them. But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get better. There's no reason for the stocks to go up. So we need things to go wrong for this group to get really attractive. And right now, the first eight, four, five companies that have reported, everything's great. Non-performers are OK. Lone growth is OK. Yeah, they're preserving here and there. But they're just being super conservative. And I would do the same thing. So we'll see what happens. But I think you'll see more issues with the economy in the non-financials for the next couple of months. I think that the struggle, the real challenges in the world is not the financial system. It's away from the financial system. David Wells Fargo is a top 10 holding in the fund. Does that company frustrate you? They had a couple I would argue, two good come back quarters to kick off this year. They come out here this morning. I would argue, expense is still high. It announced a charge. The home business under pressure, auto is under pressure. What do you make of that name? Well, again, it's a large cap fund. So I'm not going to own a $2 billion bank. So you have to own something big. But the valuation is reasonable. They've got a great historical franchise. They've had some management issues for the last four or five years, which have been very frustrating, not quite as bad as CityCorp. But certainly, they've had some struggles. And the valuation is just too cheap to ignore. And the embedded franchise value of those deposits is just too large and too powerful. And you're seeing the benefit of those deposit franchises now in higher net interest income. Just while we have you here as well, David, there's an interesting tidbit within the consumer sentiment survey that had come out just a moment ago. And particularly as we think about the consumer and the higher net income consumer as well, if you see them start to be impacted to the same kind of detriment, maybe not the same detriment. But as they're citing here negative influence on their personal finances, the highest in five months, what does that start to spell out more broadly about where consumer mindset in the economy is trending towards? Well, presumably, the Fed is doing, or is making things happen the way it wants to have them happen, meaning they're slowing the economy down. And that's showing up in certain things. Obviously stock prices are down. Home prices have stopped going up 2% a day. So I think the issue here is who's going to really feel it more. And I just don't believe that the financial, the large financial companies, the banks, are going to feel the real bite of this recession, at least not yet. It's going to be the other companies. It's going to be the companies that have reported, even you look at Nike and you look at, those companies are going to hurt a lot more than the banks are. The banks since 2008 have been in a box, they've been regulated, they've been forced to be liquid, forced to be conservative, forced to have tons of capital. And now that's paying dividends for them, in a sense that they're not seeing the struggles. So you're not really seeing what's happening yet in the economy. And I think the financials are not a good example of that yet. And so I think the numbers you're seeing are going to impact the non-financial a lot more than the financial come. David Allison, who was point at the Hennessey large cap financial fund, good to see you. Have a good weekend. Thank you. You too. All right. Thanks. All right, before we head to break, we're keeping an eye on two stocks. First out, Morgan Stanley, the analyst Ben, Swinburn, defending Spotify with an overweight rating inter-earning.

3298," All right, coming up, Y'all, it's Jennifer, Sean Barter has an exclusive interview with San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley. You won't want to miss it. We'll be right back. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Jennifer, Sean Barter. Well, on the back of that hot CPI report that showed a core reading, rising to the highest level in 40 years, investors are wondering what this means for the Fed. And if they'll get more aggressive here to weigh in is Mary Daley, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. President Daley, welcome back to the program. So wonderful to have you. It's wonderful to be here. I look forward to it. So I want to kick off this conversation and get your reaction to that CPI report and whether it changes the course of policy for you. If we look at the reading on inflation, it appears to be actually moving in the wrong direction, right? We saw core inflation, which excludes those volatile energy and food prices rise 6.6% last month up from 6.3 in August in 5.9 in July. Do you still see the Fed funds rate rising somewhere on the order of 125 basis points this year, or does the Fed need to get more aggressive on the back of this report? Sure, and you know, the CPI is one part of the dashboard of indicators we look for. It's an important one and it does show the data not cooperating. It was a very disappointing report, but I would offer it wasn't that surprising, right? We would hope that inflation would start to come down faster, but I was prepared for it to just be sluggish in its response. It's a lagging indicator. So what I'm also looking at is what's going on in the inputs to inflation are demanded supply showing any signs of coming back in balance. And here I would offer two things that you see the labor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,5,2022-10-14 14:17:56
3299," What's going on in the inputs to inflation are demand and supply showing any signs of coming back in balance. And here I would offer two things that you see the labor market cooling. It's still very strong, but it's cooling. You also see housing demand cooling. So the housing market is softening. And then today's retail sales report, which had showed flat spending is really another sign that we're getting some cooling. And that we will eventually feed through to inflation. And so my own sense is that we went in, I went into this, intermeeting period, if you will, thinking that we needed to continue to raise rates to further restrict the economy. And we'll have to be data dependent about what actual rate hikes we take, because we have domestic conditions, but we're also working in a global economy. And there's a lot of uncertainty and risks out there. And we have to think about those in the context of exactly what we do. But there's literally no doubt in my mind that we need to put more restrictive stance of policy in the economy to further get demand and supply and balance so that consumers don't have to worry about such high inflation month after month. So given that you think this is a bit of a lagging indicator and you do see some signs of cooling elsewhere in the economy, does this keep the Fed basically on course for what's been set out for the next couple of meetings or what's your sense there? Well, let's go back to the summary of economic projections, lovingly called the SEP. And that often isn't it is stale right after it's produced. But in this case, I think that's a really good guide post from our last meeting about what the path of policy is likely to look like. And then it's all about how do you get there? What's the path? And the SEP, if you remember it, it came out between four and a half and five percent rates as the best estimate of what rates would be at the end of next year. And it also said that we could get up into the fours into restrictive territory by the end of this year. And I still think that's a reasonable, really reasonable way to think about it. And I'm quite certain that some digital restriction is going to take place. And I do know that that's right for the economy. We are tightening into a strong economy. And so we need to bring it back down to something that looks a lot more sustainable in terms of the pace of growth. OK, so then to be clear, 125 basis points higher on that, but, but, but funds rate this year. And then looking at a peak of around four and a half to five percent next year still seems to be the run of play in your mind. Is that correct? Well, what I would say, Jennifer, and I just want to be crystal clear. I know people would like us to write down the exact numbers for the rest of the period. But there's too much uncertainty for that to be prudent for us. We need to be data dependent, extremely data dependent. So clearly the domestic data are pointing to further rate hikes. And I'm very supportive of continuing to put restrictions in place. I see the SEP is a good starting point and guide post for people to say that's generally where the Federal Reserve will be heading. That's consistent with my own views. But I also want everyone here listening to recognize that we're not on a preset course. We are a data dependent fed. And if more is necessary, we'll take it if less is necessary, we'll adjust. But we're not talking about at this point in my mind, you know, pausing or stopping. Nor are we talking about, you know, changing our overall strategy because the data are coming in about like we would expect. Monetary policy, actually the lag inflation is a lagging indicator. It is a hardship that continues to print so high. And I am very focused on that hardship. And I'm very mindful as my context tell me all the time that we want to make sure that price increases, that inflation doesn't become embedded in psychology. And that's why you'll hear me say again and again, we are resilient as an FOMC as a fed at restoring price stability. Even that you said monetary policy operates with a lag, you still think he would raise up to about four and a half, five percent and then, Oz at that point in 2023. Well, I think that's exactly the question we have in mind and why there's a big difference between what rate you get to and then holding it that you holding the economy in a restrictive stance of policy also continues to bridle it. So we'll end at a rate that we think is appropriate in in terms of where to stop and look around. But we still need to get the rates up in order before we ever do that and they'll go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,6,2022-10-14 14:22:06
3300," ended a rate that we think is appropriate in terms of where to stop and look around, but we still need to get the rates up before we ever do that. And then we'll go to what I would think of as what I call oftentimes a raise and hold strategy where we raise it. And then we let that sit for a while. But we are always even in that reason hold piece adjusting to the economic conditions as they come in. We are not on some sort of course that can't correct if the economy needs more, bridal or needs less bridal, but really that's how I think about it. Get you between four and a half and five is the most likely outcome and then raise to those levels and then hold at that point for some period of time. You said there is a narrow path to engineer a soft landing for this economy. There is a window for that. You think it is possible. That said this week we heard that the IMF downgraded its global outlook. It says the worst is yet to come and it warned about over tightening from global central banks and the possibility of precipitating an unnecessarily harsh global recession. At the same time we also heard from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond, who believes we could see a recession in the next nine months or sooner, given the impact of inflation on the consumer. They also said in their earnings report that they're setting aside 800 million for loan loss reserve. My question is where do you pin the odds of a recession in the next day six to 12 months. It's fascinating to me that we continue to be asked mostly by the media and others that about recession. But when I'm out in my context of nine western states that travel all over the United States, I'm not hearing signs of recession. I'm hearing signs that we'd like to grow more but we can't find workers or consumers saying when is inflation going to go away. My life would be great if we didn't have such high inflation. People have plenty of jobs opportunities. We still have a strong labor market. We have good consumer spending, even though it's flat. It's still people are spending. People are doing things that they want. I also point to one more data point that you didn't mention yesterday. I believe the conference board came out with their CEO survey and those CEOs 98% expected some sort of a slowdown. But they all, you know, what I remember from the report that was really meaningful and it's consistent with what I hear when I talk to business contacts workers, community groups is that people expect the slow down to be there, but they expected to be short lived and not very deep. That's a very different landing. That would I in my mind is the soft landing we're trying to achieve. We need to slow GDP growth substantially to get us back in demand supply balance. The labor market needs to cool further we're adding over 200,000 jobs per month in the last report. And that's another 100,000 over what it takes to just keep things study, you know, then just absorb the new entrance that come into the labor market. So clearly we're running fast demand and sluggish supply. Those things have to come back into balance. The feds tool, while it's blunt, it does directly affect the strength of demand and we're committed to bringing demand back in line with supply. You mentioned that business executives expected there is a recession. It would be a milder one. How deep of a recession is the fed willing to tolerate as you try to quell inflation and bring it down and frankly as a recession, what's needed to really get inflation under control? You know, that's not how I think about my work. Actually, we have a dual mandate full employment and price stability. My job as I see it is to treat those like they are for most people those things are related. They don't want only one or only the other. And so our job is to ensure that we can get a balance of both get jobs. Everyone who wants a job can find one, even if it takes a little bit longer as the unemployment rate moves up, they're still going to find a job and inflation comes back down to something closer to 2% in next year, you know, something closer and then gets to 2% in the course of the next two years. Those are critical things for us to achieve. And so I'm not thinking of it in terms of recession. I do think of it in terms of cooling the economy so the demand and supply come back into balance and Americans can go to bed at night and get up in the morning, not worried about whether the prices they paid a day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,7,2022-10-14 14:26:18
3301," cooling the economy so the demand and supply come back into balance and Americans can go to bed at night and get up in the morning, not worried about whether the prices they pay today are no longer going to be there tomorrow and they're not going to be able to afford the basic things they need to have their lives and livelihoods. I do want to ask I do want to ask you about one other economic scenario since inflation has proven pretty sticky and if that does expect below trend growth this year for the next couple of years as your hiking rates to pull the demand side of the economy. What's the risk that a stack flationary environment could emerge and how would the committee approach that. Well, so again, I think of stack flation that's a it's frankly a big scary word but look at the consumer sentiment that came out today there it's it's rose and then the future expectations slow to course for for for growth but that's consistent with what the economy needs. I think of what we're doing now as bringing inflation down so that we can have a durable expansion and we know that durable expansions are the ones that are best for the labor market best for all the groups that we care a lot about and that high inflation is a tax a regressive tax that's literally eating away at the lives and livelihoods of Americans we're able to bear it so when I think of that I think of slower pace of growth delivers lower inflation puts us back in balance gets us in the best position to grow once again at trend and I don't have any data right now that suggests that that's not possible. President daily want to thank you so much for your insights so appreciate it and hope to talk with you again soon. I look forward to it. Thank you so much. Thanks so much that's Mary daily president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve bank will be right back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,8,2022-10-14 14:30:05
3302," Welcome back to Yahoo Finance, everyone. U.S. retail spending came in flat in September. However, consumer sentiment coming in above estimates, even as Americans' expectations for inflation, they worsened. For more, on the state of the economy, we have Stephen Rashido, who is the Mizzouho America's chief U.S. economist. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, just help us break down the market reaction that we've seen over these past two days to some of the economic data that really factors in everything from prices that consumers are paying to the sentiment from consumers right now. Well, I think when you're looking at the overall economy in this environment, you have to keep in mind, too, thanks. One thing is, if the economy is showing more resilience than people had expected, given the pace of Fed rate hikes, that's number one. But we often forget that they've only been tightening since March of this year. So it's what, seven months into the process and the shortest possible lag between monetary policy and economic impacts of six months. That's the shortest possible lag. It's a long and durable lag, and it tends to be sometimes to the much longer lag. So the fact that we're continuing to see inflation remaining stubborn on the upside and we're continuing to see a more resilient underlying economy, always back into the fact that the labor market has not had any major significant change. And this is the critical issue. The labor market continues to be a critical piece of the equation to get inflation down and to slow the pace of underlying economic activity. And in an environment in which we're dealing with a real labor market shortage, it's really hard to do this. And therefore, there's going to be much more additional rate hikes coming down the pipeline from the Federal Reserve. Steve, I don't know if you were able to catch it, but we just had San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley on and she gave a range of potential rates where they would like to go potentially 4.5% to 5%. If we reached that 5% level, is the US economy still growing and by how much? Well, again, I actually have a higher terminal rate at this particular juncture than President Daley has and that's not surprising. The SEP issue was quoting, did not take on board the latest inflation numbers or the latest retail sales numbers or for that matter, the latest we clean unemployment claims numbers. And the answer to your question is the economy could still be growing because we're going to be there by the end of this year and early next year. So it might not be into the real recessionary environment until we get into the second quarter of 2023, given the underlying resilience in the economy. So the answer is we're going to have to see higher rates than are currently discounted in the marketplace and higher rates than she's discussing in her commentary a few minutes ago. Steven, it's Julie here. We've had a lot of folks come on the show and say the Fed is not quite looking at the right indicators and that that means there is this big risk of overshooting, but it sounds like you think the Fed should be even more aggressive or will end up being more aggressive here. So what indicators are you watching right now is sort of giving us a good snapshot of what's going on? Look, and watch the weekly initial unemployment claims numbers. They are the best real-time measure that we're looking at in terms of labor market. And what we're seeing is, yes, people may be losing their jobs, but they're getting alternative jobs very quickly and not showing up either in the claims numbers or showing up in the continuing claims numbers. The labor market is the key here. And given the fact that we have a real labor shortage, this is the battle that the Federal Reserve is fighting against. And this is the battle that they have to win before they can get any declines of inflation that are going to be considered sustainable on an ongoing basis. And until we get there, we're not, one of those things we're going to know when we get there, we're not going to be able to forecast it ahead of time. So all this analysis that we're doing about what the terminal rate should be really has to be viewed against the live input of data coming in, which is why people at the Fed like price, you know, a unit of data that no one is going to see in favor of this from underground numbers has to say, unfortunately, it can't be moving down, there's none. And, those, the empieza notices, those are the summit numbers that we're going to get",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,9,2022-10-14 14:35:40
3303," The rate should be really, you know, has to be, has to be viewed against the live input of data coming in, which is why people at the Fed, like President Daly, are telling you, we're data dependent. And what we see so far is nothing has really changed. That would change our view with regard to monetary policy. And I tend to agree with them as well. Steve, you said in your notes to us that the, by the dip strategy here is misguided. What is misguided about it? And is it still, for those who are asking themselves, should I be buying this dip? Is the answer from your perspective still no? And the answer is yes, it's still no. And the reason for this market's don't really yet discount what's going to come. There are going to be corporate failures. There are going to be banks that have significant problems. There is going to be economic pain that comes about as a result of what the Fed is doing. But the Fed really has no alternative, which is the other thing. So people seem to think the Fed has an alternative. There is no alternative to what they're doing. Allowing inflation to get embedded in the system is a long-term problem that is going to require even more pain down the road. So the Fed's prescription is take your medicine now, get it over with, and let's get it done with. And I think they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing. And I think people keep on wanting to look through to the other side of this story. The problem is this other side of this story could be further out in the calendar that investment horizons are set to. And that's the real reason why it's misguided. Stephen Reciutto, a Mizzouho America's chief US economist, always good to get some time with you. Have a good weekend. You too. Have a great weekend. Home Depot, co-founder Bernie Marcus slams the body of administration in a chat. I had with him about his new book. We'll have that interview next.好不好 mü'm gym Masters M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,10,2022-10-14 14:39:56
3304," I'm Deepo Coffounder, Bernie Marcus. Had some choice words for the Bonn administration in my exclusive chat with him on his new book called Kick Up Some Dust. He also reflected a bit on starting home depot during a period of high inflation. If you don't read history, you don't know history. We're right back where we started and we opened up during the Jimmy Carter days and in the flash, she was 20 percent, interest rates was 20 some odd percent and people were struggling. Manufacturers were struggling. We opened up in the middle of this and fortunately because of the capital market, we had cash. So we had to pay our vendors ahead of time. We paid vendors the day they delivered the product, which is uncalled for. I mean, it just doesn't happen. But we want to keep them in business. And I can tell you, there are hundreds of manufacturers who are major manufacturers today that we kept in business those days by paying our bills quickly so they can have the cash to buy product to keep the people working. And it was not an easy time. But here we are all over again. We don't learn less. Inflation is killing us. People are struggling. You know, a gallon of gas versus putting food on the table is not a place you want to be. But our customers now have that. It's unfortunate. We just still learn. Just to learn. Do you feel as though the economy doesn't feel like the same economy that it did back in 1979? Well, it's, it was easier. It was easier now to fix it than it was then. He caught or didn't have the tools. You know, he had all these people kept captive in Iran. He had, he opact really against him. And if you remember oil and gas rationing was pretty horrible. You had numbers and you couldn't get gas if you didn't have a certain number. Well, we have a president that just doesn't believe in that. We're sitting on tons of oil and gas and he doesn't allow us to drill. It's, it's, it's basically stupid. I can't come up with another word. It's stupid. And we will continue to suffer this. This inflation and our people will continue to struggle with high prices as long as he maintains this, this facade of climate control versus allowing us to do the things that we should be doing. I don't know. People live on a different planet. I think I, I feel one day I wake up in the morning and say, where the hell are they coming from? I don't understand it. What, why are they defending, not drilling when in fact climate change, you could put them off over a period of time and do it over the next 30 years, 40 years and do it intelligently, but not slam down on it and kill everybody today. So it's hurting everybody today, not good. I know you're a big free market guy, Bernie, I mean, that's how you created or helped create Home Depot. I do you mentioned, you mentioned capitalism a couple minutes ago. Do you think capitalism is under attack in this country? Oh, yes. It's under attack in universities. You have professors who are socialists, what teaching is to the young people. And we had a poll at one point that was very frightening because it showed that almost 50% of the young people would vote for socialism over capitalism. They just don't know. They get to their hearts. They don't get to their brains.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,11,2022-10-14 14:43:28
3305," people would vote for socialism over capitalism. They just don't know. They get to their hearts, they don't get to their brains. And unfortunately we have a whole group of people growing up today where they think in terms that socialism is good for America whereas in fact capitalism is what puts food on the table. It's allowed people to grow, allow people to develop economics and independence and they don't get it. When they get it it's like so many friends of mine say that their kids were socialists. I'll put till they got their first job and they took all money out of their paycheck to pay taxes and all of a sudden they became capitalist. So that may be the story. Always an entertaining, entertaining chat with Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus again, author of the new book Kick Up Some Dust. All right coming up going viral TikTok plans to build US fulfillment centers will break down what this means for the popular social media app next. Let's get down to business with a look at some other headlines we're watching now. SpaceX's Starlink satellites have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine's military since they arrived last spring. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was said earlier this month that the operation has cost SpaceX $80 million and will exceed $100 million by the end of the year. But now he says this company cannot donate more Starlink Terminal to Ukraine's army or continue funding the ones it has already has. It's asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill which he says would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,12,2022-10-14 14:47:43
3306," Pentagon to pick up the bill, which he says would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year, could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine-Southern Kursan region Vladimir Saldoy told residents on Thursday to take their children and flee. Asin Moscow is losing its grip on the territory claims to have annexed following shelling from Ukraine. Saldoy was saying on telegram that the target that the missiles hit our hotels, residential houses, markets. There are lots of civilians. A departure of civilians would be a blow to Russia, especially due to the area's strategic importance. United Airlines looking to boost its fleet of wide-body jets, the airline operator studying offers for Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus's A350. It's been in talks with the plane-makers for months, according to Bloomberg. CEO Scott Kirby told pilots at a Denver training session that the airline is planning a triple digit order with multiple wide-body models being considered. The shares of the cloud computing company Nutanix have been surging today, that's after reports the company could be seeing takeover interest from being capital. Right now, it's uncertain what prospects actually exist for a deal, but the acquiring company would likely have to pay a big premium to Nutanix's nearly $6 billion market value. The shares of 24% right now, Brad. All right, thanks so much, Julie. Well, TikTok is doubling down on e-commerce, the popular social media app looking to expand its footprints in this space by building fulfillment centers in the U.S. Yeah, we'll finance this. Kelsey Barbario joins us now with the details. All right, what do we need to know about this? It looks like, yeah, they're trying to compete with Amazon. What's going on? So, honestly, it looks like, according to reporting from Axios, we've got them filling out job list. They've got jobs listed. I'm so sorry. I am a little nervous to be here with you guys. Thank you. No, so Axios did some reporting that it looks like there are job listings up on LinkedIn for about a dozen different jobs for fulfillment centers that are going to be international. So, it looks like they're going to be getting into the e-commerce business a bit. And now, TikTok has a lot of people shopping on their platform as it is. They've got about 23.7 million people that are looking to make at least one purchase likely this year. That's according to insider, I believe. But no, so we've got, yeah, there's a ton of people. There's so much opportunity there, and they're really trying to get into that and take some of that market share from companies like Amazon, who have got Amazon Storefront, which is really popular on TikTok, and like to know it aboard style. Yeah, interesting here. And at the same time, there's all these things that TikTok is getting into that we know about, right, or that are reported upon. And one of them is that there would be some sort of QVC-like shopping feature. I mean, I know live shopping is kind of this big and growing thing, but it seems like it hasn't totally reached critical mass. Is there already a lot of live shopping on TikTok happening? I wouldn't say the QVC style that it sounds like they're trying to get into. I know that Facebook did something similar to this before. And now it looks like they're trying to make a partnership with TalkShop Live. There's nothing official there yet, but that could be something that's pretty big for them. I do know that they were testing this also in the UK and in Asia, and it wasn't very successful. I think that one of the big problems there is that a lot of people that are purchasing things from creators like the authenticity factor of it. They like feeling like it's just a creator going about their regular life, making videos about the things that they enjoy. And so I think if you kind of take away that natural element of it, there might be a problem. So I know they had issues getting creators on board in those other markets, so it would be curious to see how that happens here. I mean, I always set up a ring light in a camera when I'm doing my plant, dead duties, and now it's a... Of course. Of course it's authentic, right? I mean, but this is a big deal because TikTok reported they went through a round of layoffs in July. What does this new kind of e-commerce push really tell us about the future of the company here? Yeah, like you said, they started off with about 1,500 employees here in the US in 2020, which is pretty strong. They've been going at a pretty great clip ever since then, but then as of July, they did pull back and say that they were going to halt a little bit of their hiring. But I think that's just kind of following suit with what other tech companies are doing at this point. They're looking at the economy and they're not really sure what's going to happen. But I do think that a lot of their revenue right now is coming from add dollars. And so I think that they're trying to find a way to diversify the way that they're making their money and they see so many people, millions of dollars, if being spent through these affiliate networks, like StyleLink and RewardStyle, and they just... They want to get a little piece of that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,13,2022-10-14 14:52:38
3307," By the way that they're making their money and they see so many people like millions of dollars of being spent through these affiliate networks like StyleLink and Reward Style and they just they want to get a little piece of that. Right. It's all about making this advertising kind of element really attractive for the marketers out there especially knowing that they're looking for conversions. That's why all these platforms are trying to make it more shoppable. We'll see what that looks like within Tiktok. Would you buy anything on Tiktok? Oh I buy things on Tiktok. I'd be buying anything off to you. Yeah, okay. Oh yeah. All right well, I'm behind the curve here. Thanks so much for joining us here in Studio. Yeah, we'll find in Sizzone, Kelsey Barberio. Coming up everyone, Julie's got this week's winners and alluzers on the other side of the bring. from red hot inflation data to volatile market swings. We've seen it all this week, and Julie's got some thoughts here. It's time for our winner and loser of the week. All right, so where should we begin, Julie? Let's start with the winner. Let's start with positive, right? Because maybe because I have a little more to say about the loser of the week. The winner of the week, actually, if you look in the S&P 500, the best performer on the week is Moderna. Hey. And Moderna is down again today, and it's been down quite a bit this year, something like 47% and 48%. But it did have a positive week, up about 12%. Because the big question surrounding Moderna has been what next? Now that it proved the viability of the mRNA platform, not just it, but of course the Pfizer-BiannTech vaccine for coronavirus as well, well, how then was that platform going to be used? And we got one sign of that this week, when Moderna signed on with Merck, that the two are going to try to make an mRNA-based cancer vaccine. Now it's early stages, but this is one of the early concrete signs of what we're going to then see from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,14,2022-10-14 14:57:30
3308," RNA-based cancer vaccine. Now, it's early stages, but this is one of the early sort of concrete signs of what we're going to then see from it. So that was one of the winners. I saw it the week after the stock has been a loser this year. Soz. It is about some losers, Julie. What do you got? OK. I got one big loser for you. And that, unfortunately, for those in the UK is quasi-quarteng, who is the now resigned fire, depending on how you want to put it. Chancellor of the checker over there, who had been really closely allied with Liz Truss. And he came out with a letter today talking about his resignation. Of course, he was really the architect, along with Truss, of their big mini budget, which, among other things, was going to change the tax structure that came at a fire for proposing a tax structure on high earners, for example, a reduced tax structure. He sent his letter today. The economic environment has changed rapidly since we set out the growth plan on 23rd September in response together with the Bank of England. And excellent officials at the Treasury. We've responded to those events. And I commend my officials for their dedication. The economic environment changed because of this plan coming out. So it's just to come out with a statement like that. Yes, the conditions continue to deteriorate in the UK in terms of inflation going higher, just like it is here in the US. But it's a little disingenuous to say the economic environment has changed rapidly when you were one of the architects of that economic environment changing rapidly. In other words, seeing really a plunge in the British pound, for example, and a lot of pension funds in the UK becoming stressed. And then the Bank of England having to step in and help them with some easing to the system. So quasi-quartone, sorry for him, loser of the week. Yes, loser of the week there. You mentioned depending upon who you asked, whether it's fired or resigned. If it's the BBC, they say, well, the Bricks, they say SACT, according to the BBC. He was SACT, indeed he was. All right, everybody. Hope you have a great weekend. A kick off of Jeeta will continue our big bank discussion on the back of those earnings reports with speed capital management, bills meet. And don't forget on Monday are all markets summit happening. Monday the 17th, featuring interviews with CEOs from Target, General Motors, Microsoft. You don't want to miss that. It will be a full day of very big stuff. And have a great weekend in the meantime.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,15,2022-10-14 15:01:33
3309,". Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Big banks kicking off earnings season this morning with JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Wells Fargo and city leading the way. We're going to break down the numbers with speed capital management, CIO, built need in just a few minutes. Oil prices down as global recession fears and waiting demand outweigh concerns over supply. The global head of energy at KPMG joined us this hour to discuss the repercussions of the recent OPEC plus decision. China braces for a historic party congress president Xi Jinping expected to secure an unprecedented third term but concerns about a slowing economy could rain on his parade. But first let's do a quick check of the market action on this Friday. Another choppy session on our hands here after the historic turnaround rally that we saw yesterday. You see all three majors right now in the red. The Dow down 42 points the S&P 500 down 29 and the Nasdaq down 129. Result season kicking off with some big banks announcing their Q3 numbers this morning and that is the focus of our show JP Morgan was the headliner topping estimates thanks to higher rates. Those CEO Jamie Diamond once again pointed to hurdles and headwinds on the horizon. Let's bring in Bill Smith, speed capital management, CIO, bill. This is kind of the super bowl for you, right? You've got all the big banks reporting today. It certainly feels like if you look at somebody like JP Morgan, we're kind of back to the discussion we had a few years ago. Last year we were talking about low loss reserves being pulled back. Now we're seeing an increase there because the concerns on the horizon around the economy. Yeah, it's so interesting that after all the work that's been done, these banks have been way more capital than they need even during a sharp recession. It's all set up that way. So you've taken the worst of the downside out of the risk associated with these companies because they have a wide mode that they have the deposits of the largest adult population group, the millennials because they have the best mobile banking apps. And now over the next 10 years, those millennials are going to be outstanding customers on the lending side, what they call the liability side in the business. And then the second picture you got from these reports is Wall Street is stinking and Main Street is doing well. Elaborate on that one for me. Well, trading and IPOs and all that kind of stuff is disappearing as a profit center. And at the same time, the average person in the United States is seeing their wages go up quite a bit. So it looks like the have-nots are going to win for a while. And that could be true of the next entire next decade, which is the way that the 1970s were where we had inflation that the have-nots were getting better bargaining position from a labor standpoint. And capital for the most part was treated very poorly unless it was invested in something that benefited from inflation. Yeah, I mean, let's talk about that bit more, Bill. I mean, JPM, one of those names that you do own. Obviously, we looked to these bank earnings for any kind of color on where the economy is headed. And yet, there still does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between where sentiment is and where actual spending is. And we kind of heard that from JP Morgan today when they said they haven't necessarily seen a significant pullback in consumer spending. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,16,2022-10-14 15:05:19
3310," has certainly seen a significant pullback and consumer spending. Yeah, that's a great point, a great question. So about 80% of what goes on in the United States economy goes on regardless. Just go back and look at 07 to 09 and you'll realize that 80% of what goes on always goes on. It's that 20% of variable GDP that the recession hits, right? So if the economy contracts 4%, it means 20% of the 20% that's variable got hit. And so we feel the pain, right? Because people live a lot in that variable part of their life, not in the fixed part of their life. So that's where the concern is, but from an investor standpoint, a company is worth the net present value of the future income stream and the future cash flows. And 4% less for a year in a 20 year time continuum doesn't really change the net present value of a business very much. And that's where people make all their mistakes. They sell their stocks because of recession because they're going to get less 4% less affection from the economy. They don't do that with their spouse. They certainly don't do that with their spouse. Bill, another sector we've been watching really closely is housing and we got some color on that front from some of these bank earnings in terms of where mortgage rates are right now. Home lending originations, at least with Wells Fargo, down nearly 60% year over year at JPM, that was down 71%. How much worse do you think things are going to get on that front? Well, they've lost all the stupid stuff. You know, the people buying four houses and flipping. You know, all that stuff is going away, all the fluff. And I think Stuart Miller, the head of Lenard, said at best two weeks ago on his earnings call, he says, we're going to manage our way through this difficulty in the next 12 months so that we come out on the other side with dramatically larger market share. We own the largest home builders because over the next 10 years, there's 92 million millennials. They were seven years slower than other age groups getting started buying houses and they will buy houses the next 10 years. And that happened in the 70s with high inflation rates. We had the biggest home building boom of the last 60 years in the 1970s with sky high mortgage rates. So that sounds like you're not so cynical moving forward. I mean, you're not a cynical some others who've said that, you know, these higher rates are really going to accelerate some of the losses we've seen on that side. No, you're talking to a guy whose first mortgage was 13.5% in 1983 on a state buydown. We were anxious to get it because we had one child one on the way. That's why we like you, Bill. Some context there, right? Historical context, important. Let's talk a bit strategy right now. I'm you sort of alluded to some of these names that you think would be good buys right now. Obviously, you know, sort of the traditional thinking has been that with these big banks, especially, they could benefit on the back of higher rates. There's the macro story sort of weighing on that as well. Which one of these names you think is best positioned to write out some of the choppiness we're likely to see over the next several months? Well, we have owned Bank American JP Morgan since 2012. And if you think people are skeptical of them now, you should go back and relive 2012, right? I mean, people didn't know whether they were going to survive. Remember, we had the C-Car meetings and the Fed would give them a hard time and wouldn't let them buy back their stock when it was cheap and wouldn't let them pay dividends and so forth. So this tribulation compared to that tribulation is peanuts for these folks. They're way overcapitalized. They're super strong. So we like Bank American JP Morgan. They are the largest deposit banks to millennials because they have the best mobile banking. And now they're going to get to have them as people that borrow money for necessity purposes. And by the way, that's a powerfully positive influence in the economy. And then we love American Express because they're the favorite credit card of the millennials who, despite the fact they're getting married in record numbers this year and going to have kids in the next five years, we'll still drag those little kids all over the place on exotic travel with the travel points they get on our American Express card. And I hear you chuckling, you're probably a customer. Yeah. Just laughing at the context here. Well, we love to have you on the show.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,17,2022-10-14 15:09:54
3311," the travel points they get on our American Express Card. And I hear you chuckling, you're probably a customer. Yeah. Just laughing up the context here. Well, we love to have you on the show. Really appreciate your time today. Bill Smith, Speed Capital Management, CIO. Thank you. Well, retail sales remaining unchanged in September or missing, economists forecast of a 0.2% rise. To help break down the report, let's bring in Yahoo finances in as fray, a big data week for you this week. Retail sales, what do we see? Yeah, that's right. And so keep in mind that retail sales also, they are not adjusted for inflation. And remember that retail sales include many categories, like groceries, like vehicles, furniture, et cetera. But two interesting points from this report. First of all, excluding gasoline and auto, is retail sales grew by 0.3%. And also what's interesting is the weakness in some of these categories that we've seen. So electronics fell, furniture fell, also auto sales, those came in weak. So these are some big ticket items. And you could say that, for example, with electronics, well, a lot of people during the pandemic were buying electronics. And now they're using services more and going out more so they don't need more of that. Furniture, you know that the housing market is slowing down. So you would see a slow down in furniture sales as well. And auto sales, well, auto prices have gone up too much. And so perhaps this means the consumer is really pulling back. Another big story we're watching, and not in the US across the pond here, UK Chancellor, Acquasi Quarting, ousted by Prime Minister Liz Trot, just 38 days after taking that role. Obviously, this on the back of that initial proposal on the tax cuts, which I think by all accounts was quite disastrous in the rollout. But what can you more can you tell us about the market reaction that we've seen on the back of this? Yeah, so we did see the pound falling. We saw a bond yields being volatile. A 30-year yield of 11 basis points, the 10-year yield of six basis points, Prime Minister Trot saying that the U-turn for this corporate tax cut basically, that this is going to reassure the markets. Because we know what the markets did when these tax cuts were announced. And she said parts of the mini budget just went too far. This is to reassure those markets that were going well. I think it's also to save the bond market as well. Yeah, put one too far, kind of putting it mildly, when you look at the market reaction on the back of that. That's certainly a story we'll continue to watch. And that's thanks for that. Thank you. Well, deal making in the grocery space, leading to some big stock moves, shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Both moving to the downside here. After the second largest grocery agreed to buy Albertsons, the deal is valued at $24.6 billion with Kroger buying shares of Albertsons at a 16% premium to its closing price Thursday. The boards of both firms unanimously signed off on the deal. It still needs approval from regulators. And you see both of those stocks taking a hit today. Kroger down about 3.5% Albertsons down nearly 7%. Coming up, bearing the lead, oil supply concerns dominate after OPEC plus cuts. But isn't it demand we should be watching a signs point to recessionary cliff edge? We talk energy on the other side. Thanks for revisiting this. I'll see you later all the way. Dear fellows, Mr. Thompson and Len Luckler.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,18,2022-10-14 15:14:38
3312," way. Well, the follow-up from the OPEC Plus decision to slash supplies continues. President Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is, of course, a long-time Washington ally. The move by the oil-producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for U.S. consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all-important midterms here. The U.S. says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina May, or KPMG's global head of clients and markets. Regina gets a talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet, you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC Plus cuts decision was first made. So, I mean, what does that suggest in terms of, you know, where the real fears are at the end of the day? Is it about a potential global recession and is significant pull back in demand? Well, I think the market reacted to the headline of the secure of 2 million barrel per day cut. When the reality is that OPEC is producing 3.5 million barrels per day lower than their stated production photos. So, I saw it more as just a realization, an acknowledgement of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have spare capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw over the summer. Now the price is coming back down to earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures are where there's a lot of uncertainty. China still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. You know, we're worried about a recession. So, I think that's brought the price back down. But we saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks. And I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection. Specifically in the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC Plus decision saying essentially look despite this announcement of 2 million barrels caught a day. At the end of the day, most of these OPEC members do not meet their quotas. I mean, what's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision? Well, I think that the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait and the UAE. So those are parts of the world that do have spare capacity. And when I visit the region, you know, you hear different things from the different executives. So that was what the real cut was. But the EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023. So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have been looking up at.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,19,2022-10-14 15:18:57
3313," US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023. So I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter, and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting, and we see demand continuous spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price. Let's talk about where those prices could move. I mean, you pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party Congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. But you said we're still talking about a tight supply here. So when you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter? I'm worried a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC plus was trying to do. It's sure the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on. And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically sort of the political environment and all of this, but it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia, Slash, Russia, OPEC and the U.S. You've got the Western European countries and pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how's the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get? Well, I think, Eki, the same that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt the climate agenda is huge and we are facing a climate crisis. But the world was focusing more on number four. There's almost like a maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization your previous gifts talked about the 70s. I'm a child of the 70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago and hopefully we do a better time this time around. Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of clients and markets, Regina Mayer, good to have you on today. Well, coming up, the final frontier, Elon Musk, Warren SpaceX can't help Ukraine indefinitely. So the question here, could the crucial Starling terminals be pulled? And if they stay, who pays? We'll get into that on the other side.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,20,2022-10-14 15:22:51
3314,"... We'll space access saying it can no longer pay for critical satellite services in Ukraine. And it's asking the Pentagon to pick up the tab. And according to reporting at a CNN, Musk appears to have confirmed the report in a tweet, writing in part, strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors and space launching communications, Lockheed and Boeing, who get over $60 billion. Now, the same CNN report, reference SpaceX figure shared with the Pentagon. Take a look at this. 85 percent of the 20,000 starlinked terminals in Ukraine were paid for or partially paid for by countries like the U.S. Poland or other entities. Who also paid for about 30 percent of the internet connectivity. Now, SpaceX says that costs about $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. Musk has said there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine to break it all down. Let's bring in Praz, Supermanian, and Praz. The reason we're talking about this, some context here, is that earlier this year Elon West started seem to apply that we're doing this good thing where we're going to be donating starlink that this was all being paid for by SpaceX. That's not necessarily the case in this story out of CNN, really does point to the cost of operating it, who's footing the bill, and what this means ultimately for the future, because Ukraine has really come to rely on this for connectivity. From what I understand, it's a huge part of their operations against Russia. They need this connectivity. You know, when we first heard about Musk donating the starlink service, we thought this was free. They were actually out of their pocket, sending them the actual terminals and paying for the service, but it turns out, it looks at 85% is inputted by the U.S. and actually Poland paying a lot for this terminal. So a little surprise there. Also the odd timing, it's like Musk also kind of noting the fact that after he put out that supposed controversial peace plan, and then the Ukrainians were... Queen Russia and Ukraine, which seemed to suggest that he was more in line with the Russian thinking. Exactly, not so much the Ukrainian side, and then Ukrainians were upset about that, and then all of a sudden, oh, by the way, you get a pay for this, according to the CNN obtained report letter that they sent to the defense department. So like I said, odd timing here. It's sort of a strange sort of... I really don't understand why Musk would even put out this sort of image that he's actually donating this stuff in actual... Actually, actually he was not. It's not a cheap service. SpaceX is not a charitable organization. It is a company that's trying to be profitable, and it's cost a lot of money, so I understand that part. SpaceX worth 120 billion valuation. Musk worth 200 billion personally. So I think it's hard for people to sort of kind of round out the, hey, we're going to... You need to get paid for the service when the actually you guys are actually worth. I've got a lot of money. Musk obviously never wanted to stay silent, especially on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,21,2022-10-14 15:27:35
3315," I think it's hard people to sort of kind of round out the hey we're going to you need to get pay for for the source when you actually you guys are actually worth a lot of money. And Elon Musk obviously never wanted to stay silent, especially on Twitter when he's been getting a lot of pushbacks since that report came out from CNN last night. What have we even hearing from him today? Well, we saw today, you know, I mentioned that from late last night about how, hey, the LEO connectivity is a very expensive business, it's not cheap, we are digging out of our own pockets to do this, so don't expect us to pay for this going forward. We're talking about 120 length of the entity of the year and then I think 300 to 400 million through next year. So it is not cheap, you know, SpaceX is trying to get their model off the ground, so I totally understand that. So that's what he's saying right now, but I think you sort of caught in the cross here, is it of do you support Russia or Ukraine and why are you actually kind of debating this right now? The grand scheme of things, now that we kind of know that the numbers in terms of, you know, what the connectivity, the service itself is going to cost, how significant is startling to the future of SpaceX? Because this is something that, you know, it's been getting a lot of attention because this is a real use case in Ukraine. They have to your point really come to rely on this service, but in the grand scheme of things for SpaceX, how big is startling? I believe it's, it was supposed to be a big component of their profitability, it's a service that they can offer, not only is it 4,500 for that high end terminal service, but also it's 50 bucks a month for families and other people to use that in places like India, for instance, like they want to deploy that there. It is a big part of their sort of mission to kind of not only just send elevators into space with rockets, but also to sort of connect everyone through the world through global satellite internet. So it is a big part of that story and a big part of that profitably component, but I guess right now it's still not fully profitable. Okay, something to watch there. According to Elon Musk. According to Elon Musk, always according to Elon Musk. Elon Musk, thanks so much for that. We're continuing the never ending saga between Elon Musk and Twitter. Court documents and SEAL Thursday revealed that Elon Musk is under federal investigation for actions connected with his $44 billion dollar Twitter acquisition. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan Alexis. What how many days ago were we talking about how well the deal is probably going to get closed and here we are talking about another investigation. What is this specifically? Well, that's a big part of the story of all the around. Okay, so it could be investigations plural because of the way that this filing is phrase. Now why are we learning about this? It's because Twitter is asking for the judge in the Delaware case, the dispute over the acquisition that's currently stayed, the trial is stayed, not the case going forward. And asking for the judges help saying we want must to turn over the communications that his attorneys had with federal authorities. The way they specifically phrase it is they want those communications concerning Twitter and the Twitter transaction. Twitter wrote to the judge saying that Musk, the way they phrase it is presently under investigation by federal authorities for his conduct concerning the acquisition. They want to say that they want those documents specifically because they bear upon key issues in the litigation. Now there's no further details about what exactly that conduct is. Twitter says Musk's attorneys, Quinn Immanuel, had turned over about 1700 documents that they said were privileged and therefore could not be read by the other side. But Twitter is saying no among those documents are these draft communications from his lawyers with these authorities. One being a May 13th email sent to the SEC, a draft to the SEC rather, they actually dispute why there's not the final communications with pertaining to these documents. The second one is a slide presentation for the FTC. So they want those documents. They want to dig a little bit further into those investigations. Now we do know though that Musk was suspected to be under investigation because of the way he handled the acquisition altogether. We know that back when he was acquiring the Twitter stock and when he passed that 5% threshold going to 9% stake in Twitter, we know that he filed late with the SEC. And we also know that he filed the wrong document which was for passive investors instead of active investors. So at a minimum we should expect that the SEC would want to look into this. Really quickly, what does this mean in terms of the timeline for a potential acquisition? Getting completed? How is this going to complicate the process? Yeah, you know, I don't think necessarily that this particular issue will push out if there is going to be a trial and you further. The parties have had contentious issues every step.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,22,2022-10-14 15:32:00
3316," early that this particular issue will push out if there is going to be a trial at any further. The parties have had contentious issues every step along the way. And certainly these discovery fights are to be expected. Absolutely, each party is going to fight hard to make sure that they don't have to turn over to the other side something that they don't want to see. Yeah, good point. There are no real surprises at this point after all the back and floor. Thanks so much for that. Well, coming up, setting the tone, JP Morgan beats the street. It's the higher rates. But Jamie Diamond wants to get points to economic headwinds. Who's in the eye of the storm? I'm going to look to some big reports on deck next. Well. In a group of men who have never published yet, you can never really say the truth. Earlier on Yaku Finance, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly joined our very own Jennifer Schomburger to talk about the latest CPI print and the Fed's policy. Take a listen to what you have to say. We will have to be data dependent about what actual rate hikes we take because we have domestic conditions, but we're also working in a global economy. And there's a lot of uncertainty and risks out there. We have to think about those in the context of exactly what we do. But there's literally no doubt in my mind that we need to put more restrictive stance of policy in the economy to further get demand and supply imbalance so that consumers don't have to worry about such high inflation month after month. We're joining us now to talk about the impact of the Fed's policy. We've got Tom Hanlon, senior investment strategist at US Bank, wealth management. Tom gets to talk to you today. Let's pick up on that point that Mary Daly just made. She insists the Fed is still data dependent. The data suggests in her words that restrictive policy needs to continue. Is that how you see it? Oh, sure. And thanks for having us on. Yeah, the CPI print yesterday. So core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy at a 40-year high. And then today you have the consumer sentiment indicator from University of Michigan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,23,2022-10-14 15:36:09
3317," CPI print yesterday, so core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy at a 40-year high. And then today, you have the consumer sentiment indicator from University of Michigan, where consumers are asked where they see inflation, and that actually ticked higher, which is not the direction the Fed wants to see. So I think that the member, Daley, is representing that the data continues to suggest that the Fed needs to continue to tighten to bring inflation back under control. The data may suggest that the Fed needs to continue tightening control. But, Daley also in that interview said that this concern about that tightening, and how aggressively they're moving leading to a recession, a hard landing, so to speak, doesn't necessarily jive with what she has heard personally. So she talks about going out on the road, speaking to business owners who aren't necessarily asking about a recession, saying, yeah, they're concerned about higher prices, but we're worried about hiring. We're worried about other issues. I mean, what do you make of this disconnect that we continue to hear between this fear of, you know, those like Jamie Dimon saying there was a big recession on the horizon, and then others were saying, well, that's not really the prime concern, though. Yeah, I think it's just a difference in where we are today, to where we may be in 2023. So certainly, if you look at employment, that doesn't suggest that we're in a recession right now. There's still 10 million job openings and unemployment remains low. And the consumer remains in pretty healthy shape, and we still have a lot of savings that accrue during the pandemic that they're able to drop on as we get toward the holiday season. I think that the question is, at what point do federal reserve rate hikes start to eat into both consumer spending and business sentiment in the form of lowering investment in future gains? So, I think the question is, what does this look like not necessarily today, but in 2023? And there is the potential that the Fed continues to tighten into this slowing economy, and potentially do end up in that type of recession. It's not necessarily our base case today. I think that's what you're seeing in terms of capital market volatility, which is how far will the Fed have to tighten to get inflation under control? What rate will that do to consumer spending and business investment? Let's talk more about the volatility. I mean, yesterday we saw what was an incredible turnaround, rally, a huge swing, and today we saw, by the way, yesterday coming on the back of what was a stronger than expected CPI print. Here we are today talking about a dip in the other direction again. What do you think is behind this choppin-as? Yeah, so the initial market reaction on the CPI print yesterday was down, and you reach levels that technicians or other market observers suggest that maybe reached this oversold condition where program buying started to kick in, and then as the stocks market started to recover, perhaps you started to get more people participating at upside. It was a pretty high volume day yesterday, so that suggests that there was a lot of participation in it. But again, when you go back to the fundamentals, when you go back to what's going on in the economy, and you go back to the fears about inflation and what the Fed needs to do, today was just one more data point that let you know that inflation isn't yet anywhere near the Fed's target rate, and the Fed's going to have to continue to tighten policy. Is this kind of chopping-as continuing? You think moving forward here as we look ahead to the next FOMC meeting? Yeah, I mean, we think it sets up as a pretty news heavy year as we call it here in the fourth quarter, so you've got two Federal Reserve meetings, one in November, one in December. You've got the midterm elections and setting up in the first couple of weeks in November, and then you have, you know, still has more CPI prints and other economic releases, and we're just getting started on third quarter earnings and the corporations. This will be a key focal area as well, is what is corporate America seeing in terms of the outlook? Is it as visible as they thought it was in previous quarters, or things starting to get cloudy in terms of the four looking outlook? So these are the things that are going to play into now until the rest of the year. We think that sets up for a fairly choppy capital market and equity market going forward. Tom Hanlon, US Bank wealth management senior investment strategist, appreciate your time today. And shift your attention to the labor market and UF employers appear to be thinking twice before laying off workers. At least that's what our chart of the day suggests. This data coming from Axio Siding Fred shows a historically low level of layoffs and unemployment in the economy as things stand. All this has to be a persistent fear that we are inching toward a sharp slowdown. The spike you see is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,24,2022-10-14 15:40:10
3318," of layoffs and unemployment in the economy as things stand, all this amid persistent fears that we are inching toward a sharp slowdown. The spike you see is, of course, down to the mass layoffs during the peak of COVID in 2020, which may serve as a warning not to pull the trigger too soon this time around. We're not saying it's down to so-called labor hoarding, but it's certainly one of those theories that have been making the rounds for some time. Coming up, attention turns to Beijing. China's National Congress begins on Sunday, a mammoth gathering that will solidify the leadership of President Xi Jinping. But will it trouble the economy and zero COVID policy overshadow the event? That's our next. Let's meet soon! It is time now for this week's bi-denomics. The last CPI report before the midterms was grim reading for Americans and the administration after another stubbornly high number, President responded by saying inflation would be worse under Republicans. Morning consults, latest polling track or tell. The story illustrating the president's popularity or lack of it among voters in 45 out of 50 states. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman. Rick we're so close to the midterms here. How much are we to make of another data set that points to inflation remaining high, the impact of that on the elections? Well, it's a big data set in a really important one. There was some hope among Democrats toward the end of the summer. Gas prices were coming down by a lot. President Biden's approval rating was ticking up. Some surveys showed that voters were feeling better about Democratic control of Congress. There was some hope that maybe Democrats actually would be able to buck the usual trend of the midterm elections and hold on to both countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,25,2022-10-14 15:44:24
3319," better about Democratic control of Congress. And so there was some hope that maybe Democrats actually would be able to buck the usual trend of the midterm elections and hold on to both houses of Congress. But for that to happen, they needed basically everything to go their way during the last few weeks leading up to the midterm elections on November 8th. And everything is not going their way. I mean, what Democrats really needed was gas prices to continue going down, but also consistent improvements in inflation. And we just haven't had that. So inflation peaked at 9% over the summer. And there was some hope that by now we would be below 8%, and maybe even below 7%, but we're not. We're down to just 8.2%. So inflation is very stubborn. And so far, all the federal reserve interest rates heights, interest rate heights that have been going on since March, have not had any notable impact on inflation. Now, they will have an impact on inflation, but there's a lag. And this timing is just not going to help Democrats. So I'm seeing a lot of political analysts who are saying this latest inflation number from September, basically, ISIS it for Republicans, they seem very likely to regain at least one house of Congress in the midterms. And that means they'll be able to block Biden's legislative agenda. We'll find out just a few weeks out from that all important midterm election. Rick Newman, thanks so much for that. GM. We'll say with big political events, China is set to kick off a historic National Party Congress this weekend. The country's struggling economy should have be a key focus in the face of President Xi Jinping's ongoing zero-COVID policy. Data today shows consumer prices in September rose. At the fastest pace, they've gone since April of 2020. It's certainly hard to overstate the importance of the event. The National Congress happens only once every five years. It outlines the broad priorities for the nation. More importantly, there are suggestions. The overall mission statement will pivot from a long-held focus on economic growth to security. The future structure of the Rolling Party will also be determined. China watchers eagerly awaiting details on the next premiere. He's traditionally part of the all-important standing committee or a Politburo and the nation's second most powerful man the big takeaway president Xi is poised to win a third term, making him the most powerful leader of China since Mao Zedong. Let's dive deeper into this big kickoff with Nargiza Saljanova, she's a Rodeum Group China Practice Director. Nargiza, you have put out this very interesting annual report the China Pathfinder that really takes a closer look at where China's economy is right now. All eyes are going to be on that third term or at least the president securing that third term. What is that likely to mean for in terms of how the economic policy shifts for China? That's right, as you said. The 20th party Congress means everyone is trying to really define what is the future of China's economic policy. And what the China Pathfinder project which we have worked on in partnership with the Atlantic Council shows us is that China's capture of one has really stagnated. Not enough to undo some good progress that they've done since their WTO accession, but in areas from open-est investment to market competitiveness, we see a pause or in some cases a rollback. And as we know, the role of the state has been surging in many regards in every part of the economy and society we have seen parties intrusion, increasing which really sends a warning and a caution to foreign investors, to domestic companies, what to expect coming out of the party's Congress is on everyone's mind. So it's where it's sort of looking back to where we were a year ago. China was growing at an annualized rate of 8%. Now you've got the World Bank forecasting 2.8% growth, many major banks have come out and set 3% in 2022. Well, what is the pivot that's likely to come out of this party Congress, or is there one given that number one, the president has doubled down on the zero-COVID policy? But number two, I mean, we have really started to see a reckoning in the real estate sector. And the real estate sector is, I think, the core issue for us to focus on, right? Delivering up to 25% of China's economic growth. And there's no...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,26,2022-10-14 15:48:50
3320," And the real estate sector is, I think the core issue for us to focus on, right? Delivering, you know, up to 25% of China's economic growth. And there's no substitution for that. The government has not been really able to set up new drivers of growth, which will take China forward and able to deliver the same kind of growth that China and observers have been able to enjoy. There has not been a proper resetting, even with all the downgrades, and we've seen them coming down and down and down through the entire year. A couple of important things to watch out for, right? And this is going to be true for both China's domestic audience and external audiences. What happens with zero COVID? Nothing has disrupted China's economy as much to going to the core of China's society as zero COVID policy. And it's really unlikely that there's going to be a real kind of aggressive shift unveiled at the party congress. That's really the time to use a reset and retrench, but looking forward, what happens? It's going to be a much better situation for China if there is a stronger signal that the policy is going to be stopped, rather than kind of a fudging and slurring its way through a kind of gradually declining to that. Another really important consideration to watch out for is the new crop of leaders being appointed into key positions. Every appointment is going to give you the reliance of whether it points to further consolidation of power by Xi Jinping and a further retrenchment, or will technocrats be at the reins once again and be allowed to put in place more policies which stabilize China's growth, which put it on a more sustainable path and push reform forward. Another really important thing to pay attention to is what happens with a greater unveiling or a greater emphasis on what common prosperity actually means. As we know, that's an important policy that Xi Jinping has put his personal and premature on. And Chinese officials have been at teens to say that there is not going to be a massive redistribution, but it isn't really clear how common prosperity is going to play out. Norgisa, I'm thinking back to just how much the message from the top down has shifted over the last five years since this last party Congress. We were talking about President Xi talking about quality growth, not growth at all costs, also talking about raining in debt. It feels like he sort of put that aside. He's certainly a bigger focus, at least that's the expectation moving into this. You think President Xi is willing to put security front and center at the expense of a slowdown in the economy because that has sort of moved hand in hand in terms of foreign direct, foreign investments coming in. Company saying, rethinking their presence in China. Where's the priority here, you think, for the next five years? So we have to be careful here, not to over general rise. Every all governments and all politicians, Chinese officials are able to have multiple levers that they pull depending on the need and depending on their core priorities. But it is certainly true that political considerations and in any case of security considerations have been overriding a lot of the economic priorities in recent years. We've seen this manifest that in China's relationship with some of its external partners, for example, the way that the comprehensive agreement on investment with the EU was really undermined by the decisions of Chinese policy makers and their emphasis on policies which the EU officials just found intolerable. What does this ultimately mean for companies that are still doing business in China? Investors, I mean, you point out in your report itself, there's increasing questions about whether China is investible. Right. I think, regardless of what happens at the 20th Party Congress, China faces a prolonged period of week or a growth. And this is because even if Chinese officials really decide to sort of go all in on a new aggressive reform package, tangible structural changes will take years to be realized.

3323," sites. I just want to get your reaction to the headline figure and the fact that we've seen still some of the persistence in inflation nudging higher and showing up in prices. No doubt about it. So I think what really scared the markets here was the strength in the core inflation readings in particular. You mentioned we have rents going up pretty rapidly. This was the largest month over month rise in rental inflation since June 1990. And we know that the Fed is very focused on the slow moving stickier parts of the inflation process. A lot of things tied to the service economy which has been rebounding. And we have to keep in mind that a lot of these numbers tend to follow the business cycle with long and varied lags. So in particular sticky core inflation measures like rents will tend to follow the economy by five quarters. That means the strength here could simply be a reflection of how the economy was doing 15 months ago. And that's really what has these market prices in a bit of a squeeze. And that's that the Fed is reacting very aggressively to backward looking information. A lot of the forward looking measures of inflation have really come down sharply. But the Fed is overlooking that and they are hitching their policy moves to deeply lagging indicators. And the economy is caught in the cross crosshairs of that. So Mike, what are those forward looking indicators that you are taking your cues from when you're saying maybe we're seeing a little bit of positivity coming on the inflation front. And then what you're saying implies that the Fed is indeed making a mistake here. Yeah, I think they are on the cusp of going too far and way too fast. I think there was some justification for them moving aggressively when the rate hikes started. But to persist now with these 75 base point rate increases with an inverted yield curve and with residential real estate hitting the skids, I think is a mistaken strategy. But in particular, the sensitive forward looking price level indicators that are moving lower in a dramatic fashion commodity prices in a big bear market, they ran up dramatically for two years on the front edge of the inflation process and the Fed ignored it. The dollar has soared in a historic fashion. Bond market inflation expectations where investors are putting their money on the line have come down dramatically. And let's not forget how this whole inflation process started with the huge explosion of the Fed's balance sheet of big rise and broad money. A lot of expansionary fiscal policy. All of that is going into reverse gear now. And I mentioned residential real estate a moment ago. That's where the the V shaped boom really started in terms of the whole recovery process. So everything that has been on the front edge of the boom in the inflation process has rolled over very sharply. And yet the Fed is acting in an aggressive manner looking in their rear view mirror. Well, then the Michael, how do we get inflation down? And this is the Fed's gig. Their sole purpose is there is to among many other things full employment and get inflation under control. If they're not out there being aggressive, who does that fall to? Do we have to look at the bottom administration to finally do something? Yeah, it's this is the Fed's responsibility in terms of inflation. At least the portion of inflation that's due to strong demand and by our calculations that's most of it. But the Fed also needs to be forward looking. If they were forward looking, they wouldn't have put the monetary stimulus on as long as they did. They would have been sooner to tighten policy. And there would be less of a risk of overshooting on the other side, which is exactly where we are now. So I would seem to me that they could improve policy by looking forward, by incorporating some of those forward looking indicators into their process. So they should really be slowing down the pace of hikes now, not reacting in a belated panicky fashion to deeply lagging indicators. That is a prescription for an accident. At the same time, you know, you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,30,2022-10-14 16:06:00
3324," laid-it panicky fashion to deeply lagging indicators. That is a prescription for an accident. At the same time, Mike, you know, you, one has to sympathize sort of, right? Like, you see this alarming number, right? And there is the perception that the Fed has to act on this. Of course, you're not the only one with this message. We are seeing now and hearing from an increasing number of economists who are saying something similar to what you are saying. What we convinced the Fed to listen? In the past, we have sometimes seen dramatic things happen in the market that have then convinced the Fed to act, perhaps belatedly. How would that kind of a scenario play out? Well, I mean, I think the setup here is we're going to need to see some softness in these lagging indicators, or at least some of the coincident information. Pay rolls were very strong in September. So that didn't do the trick. This core inflation data has been strong. And so we're really going to need to see the momentum there break to the downside. I think that is coming. I'll give you another forward indicator that was peaking six months ago. The ISM prices paid index. Typically, there's about a six month lag in terms of when that's showing up in the inflation meetings. And so if you go back to six months ago, we are basically at the high for 2022 there. And now we're off very sharply. So over the next three to six months, I think we're going to get some better news on inflation that may not be soon enough to save the economy from a recession with the Fed likely to keep going pretty aggressively here. And then in the near term, and then the discussion right before I came on was about, you know, these peak policy rate expectations now are pushing towards 5%. That's well above the rates across the whole treasury yield curve, which, you know, to me means if that happens, we will be going into a recession. Inflation will fall very sharply in a recession. And then the Fed will be backtracking and cutting rates in an embarrassing fashion. Mike, for consumers who wake up this morning and see the headline number and then also see the market reaction, there's also the reality of how they think about their own spending. Does this change any household spending even knowing just how much we're paying for everything from groceries to some of the other necessities and even some of the discretionary items that we still continue to buy? No doubt about it. I mean, the labor market has been very strong in resilience. So that's sort of been the saving grace. But these, you know, this inflationary backdrop has certainly been an irritant to households. And we can see that in a lot of weak confidence data. So far, that hasn't been enough to stop the economy in its tracks, but we have the Fed tightening very aggressively. And that will hit the economy with a lag. Over the last seven months, policy rates have gone up 300 basis points. And in real terms, if we use inflation expectations, which have been falling since March, a 400 basis point rise, that is the most rapid rise in short-term interest rates that we've seen since the early 1980s going into a very deep and very long recession. So I think households, unfortunately, here are also caught in the Fed's crosshairs because the tightening is likely to keep going until it kills the labor market. Though kill inflation, but they're going to end up killing the labor market with it. Oh, all right. So brewing here, Mike, thank you so much for being here with your analysis.

3325, you you it is Thursday October 13th here in New York City on Brad Smith with Julie Hyman and Brian Saasie an ugly day on Wall Street after another red hot inflation report CPI month of a month coming in at four tens of a percent in a move higher the economic data keeps on coming jewels over to you for some housing news as well right now 6.92 percent Brad that is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage that data just coming out to us from Freddie Mac 6.92 percent by the way is the highest going back to April of 2002 all of this of course goes back to the Fed raising interest rates and also has already had ripple effects throughout the housing market putting pressure on pricing putting pressure on demand and affordability we've been watching these mortgage numbers very very closely because obviously they have really ratchet it up the monthly cost for people who are taking out a 30 year mortgage in order to buy a house so we've got that number we've got that CPI number all of it pointing to continued inflation at least for now but now are joined by someone who has has her eyes on potential deflation that of course is Kathy Wood our our Invest Founder and CEO and you recently wrote an open letter to the Fed where you warned about deflation we talked to Michael Darda of MKM at the top of the show where he said the Fed is making the mistake of looking at backward looking indicators what should the Fed be looking at Kathy when it's trying to really assess what is happening with inflation sure hi Julie and Brian well if you look at what's happening in the pipeline what you're seeing in terms of commodity prices are some very serious declines both from their peaks and year over year now so that is sort of we would say that's upstream inflation that is heading towards the PPI and then ultimately the CPI so we've got gold prices and in fact I looked at them yesterday I had thought that the last two years gold had been trading within the 1700 to nearly 21 hundred dollar range and that's true it has and it has broken down this is a really good leading indicator of inflation what caught my surprise yesterday was looking at where gold was in 2011 it was roughly this level so you can say from since 2011 more than 10 years we haven't had a big burst in a big breakout in the gold price and and that is informing our decision here gold is a leading indicator of inflation and it has not broken out it is breaking down and then the second thing that we're looking at is the inventory glut around the world and especially in the United States it looks like some of the best supply chain managed companies in the world have over over ordered they ignored their automated enterprise resource planning systems so ERP systems and double ordered triple ordered so that Nike for example its sales were up only three and a half percent globally last quarter and yet it's inventory is up 44,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,32,2022-10-14 16:14:22
3326," Nike, for example, its sales were up only 3.5% globally last quarter. Yet its inventories were up 44%. In the United States, they were up 68%. If you look at it in transit, they're up 85%. That's just one indication. We're seeing lots of inventory overhangs. Even online sales are suffering. Amazon just had its second prime day. And it showed no increase, which is really from a year over year, which is telling us that either units are down or prices are down. So I think the CPI that we got today is a lagging indicator. It always is a lagging indicator. And we're seeing a lot of prices in the pipeline that are falling. So, Kathy, let's talk about what this means for the Fed. And your open letter to the Fed, where you urge them to consider some of what you're talking about right now. The market after today's data is now more fully pricing and not just a 75 basis point increase at this upcoming meeting. But at the one after that as well, do you think the Fed should be done? Do you think they should even raise 75 basis points at this upcoming meeting? Or do you think they should stop here and give some time for their increases to make their way through the economy? Yes. As we're thinking about this question, we compare what Chairman Powell is doing to what Chairman Volcker did in the late 70s, early 80s, when he was fighting an inflation problem that had been building for 15 years, Vietnam War, Great Society, Closing the Gold Window. That was a real inflation problem that built up over 15 years. This inflation problem has been 12 to 15 months by the time the Fed started addressing it. And we think it's much more a function of supply chain imbalances, caused by COVID, and then again, by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. These are very, very different circumstances. So what the Fed has done this time around is it has increased interest rates. If they go another 75 basis points, which is very likely on November 2nd, they will have increased interest rates from 0.25 to 4%. And that's a 16 fold increase. What did Volcker, in the early 80s, he took interest rates from 10 to 20%. That's a two fold increase after consumers and businesses had gotten used to dealing with inflation and working around it over 15 years. This is a real shock to the system. And I do believe we will see the ramifications. In many ways, we're seeing housing shutting down. And I think we're going to see a lot of other activities shutting down as well. We believe we're in a recession. And we believe this recession now will be sustained. And if we see an increase in GDP, it's probably because either inventories are continuing to increase or imports are coming down as companies try to unwind their inventories. Kathy, so do you see a severe recession? And then how long do you think this bear market will continue? Well, what's interesting, I think many people are coming around to the idea that we're in a recession or we're going into a recession. The first two quarters with real GDP growth negative to us means we're in a recession. And now that many people are worried and are beginning to see recession for us far as the eye can see, we are looking at this recession a little bit differently. We think it's going to be a function of this massive inventory overhang and that it's going to be a serious inventory correction. But it's not going to be anything like we saw in 0809. That was a systemic financial problem caused by the mortgage and financial meltdown. We don't think this is the same thing. So now that many economists are starting to agree with us that we're in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit too alarmist. If this is just an inventory.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,33,2022-10-14 16:19:01
3327," or in a recession or going into a recession, we feel that they might become a little bit to alarmist if this is just an inventory recession. And I think the Fed will have a lot to do with whether or not it is. This is a shock, though, to the system. And this idea that we have an inventory overhand, we think it's going to get bigger as consumers pull back, low saving rates, 3.5% versus 8% where it was before COVID. And so we'll see. We think this holiday season is going to be pretty tough. And so as you kind of read your shopping list for that holiday season, Kathy, when you think about some of the kind of ways that equity valuations are starting to price in that recession to the best of their ability, is there a big buy that you now kind of think through or evaluate going into the end of the year here? Well, you have to consider the source here. And our focus, our sole focus, is on disruptive innovation. And we also believe that innovation solves problems. We had a tough time going into COVID with our kind of strategy. And then we had a boom in our strategy during COVID, because guess what? We needed the genomic revolution to help sequence the coronavirus and figure out tests and vaccines. And our kinds of companies helped with that. We think with supply chain issues and with the food and energy prices caused by this shock, this Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that once again, innovation is going to help solve these problems. Electric vehicles, there's an accelerated consumer preffership towards electric vehicles, like Tesla, because of oil prices. And we think there's no stopping that trend now. And in terms of food prices, we do believe that gene editing is going to help us figure out how to produce crops in areas that are less fertile than the Ukraine, the bread basket of Europe, with less water, less fertilizer, less pesticide. So we're going to continue to see the miracles associated with the genomic revolution. But our other strategies as well, whether we're talking about robotics, solving the labor shortage, energy storage, I mentioned electric vehicles, pulling us away from oil consumption, artificial intelligence, which is going to help every company become more competitive if they use their data and combine it with other data in effective ways. And then blockchain technologies, which is going to take the middleman out of a lot of businesses, and take the cost out of a lot of businesses, helping us to solve this inflation problem. So again, consider the source. We think innovation solves problems. It certainly gave us an appreciation of that. During COVID, our strategy was high flying. And we think we have even more problems right now. So stay tuned.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,34,2022-10-14 16:23:15
3328," you Natalie Lec Shima. Kathy, this economic shock that you talk about in large part at the hands of the Fed, does that cause a shock to one of your long-term holdings in Tesla in terms of the stock price and also the company's financials? Well, certainly all stocks are experiencing difficulty in this environment as the market tries to understand how far the Fed is going to go and how deep this recession is going to be. So, Tesla, as I mentioned, is a solution to the problem. It's very interesting. If you look at gasoline demand this summer in the United States, it dropped below COVID levels, the worst of COVID, and it dropped to levels that we have not seen since 1997. That's real demand destruction, and it couldn't have happened. We do not believe without electric vehicles at the margin taking huge share from traditional automobiles. So, if we had to be concerned about an industry, it would be the traditional auto industry, we think that gas powered vehicles are going to be obsolete within the next five to ten years, and the traditional auto industry has to figure out a way to migrate into electric vehicles and into the next big phase, which we think Tesla is leading, the autonomous taxi platform phase. So, lots of changes here. Traditional industries are in harm's way as innovation pushes through accelerated by some of the turmoil out there. Cathy, when we last talked back in the spring, I believe it was just at the beginning of the Elon Musk Twitter saga. Now we are maybe getting to a little bit of closure in that case, but I would post you the same question that I asked you then, because a lot of time is elapsed in different events have happened. Are you at all concerned about Musk's attention wavering now that it looks like he is in fact going to be taking over and likely at least having a pretty heavy hand in running Twitter? Well, we are prolific users of Twitter. Our gives away its research. We give away our research not when it's finished, but as it's evolving. And our most prolific platform, social platform out there, is Twitter. I'm kind of excited to see what Elon will do. I actually think he'll work closely with Jack Dorsey and maybe open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent, and I think add more value to that ecosystem. You don't think it'll be a mess if that happens? It'll just be sort of a free-for-all where it's tougher to find commentary of value. You know what's interesting about Twitter and what we found this? We have a lot of debate around our own strategies. We can filter that debate ourselves so we can unfollow people if we think there's bad behavior, but that's our choice. And we can follow those people who we think are moving discussions, whether it's about innovation or the economy, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,35,2022-10-14 16:27:53
3329," whether it's about innovation or the economy, moving discussions along. So I think there's a lot of wisdom out there. And we're kind of sick of the nonsense that we see on some of these social platforms. And Twitter, I think, is going to give us more tools to filter out the nonsense and get right down to business. I certainly would like to filter out a lot of the nonsense sometimes on Newark Addy. I want to ask you more broadly about our converse and your funds. I was looking at art K in particular and the fun flows that we have seen, which were seeing sort of bigger swings to the up end to the downside. Earlier in the year, they've gotten a little more muted as of late. You talk a lot about your three to five year time horizon, which I think makes sense. But I wonder how long, how patient investors are going to be, particularly in an environment where they are seeing losses, not just in our K, but in lots of other areas as well. Yes. And I think one thing that helps our clients is our research. And they see that it's first principles research. We have the long term time horizon. And we're seeing spectacular exponential growth opportunities. And not only one by one, the various platforms I just described, but the convergence of those platforms. So one ask her feeding another. And I think many of our clients understand that they're short innovation, truly disruptive innovation. If you own the NASDAQ or the NASDAQ 100 right now, and you look through that index, this is not the index that I grew up with. In the 80s and 90s, when we were looking for innovation, we'd go to the NASDAQ. But if you look through the NASDAQ now, and especially the NASDAQ 100, what you see are 25% of the names touching disruptive innovation, the rest of them are kind of me too. They look like other indexes, the fangs, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla would be our only overlap. And then you look further and more deeply into these indices. And you see names that you'd never expect to be there. Food and beverage, utilities, rails, brick and mortar retail. These are not innovation companies. And so what we've done at ARC is we are pure play innovation. And we'd like to think we are what the NASDAQ used to be in the 80s and 90s. And it used to be a very productive place to invest with a long term investment time horizon. So I think our sharing our research, and our pointing out to investors, look, what you think you own in innovation is not what it used to be. And what ARC is doing is really back to the future. We're all about investing in the future as opposed to indexes, which are more about past success. Those companies that have been extremely successful have risen to the top of these indexes. But if we're right in these five platforms that involve 14 different technologies are going to disrupt the traditional world order, then investors need to get to the right side of change. And one of the other things that we do, it's one of our missions and values, is to educate. That's why we give our research away. And we want to educate not only investors, but parents and grandparents about how the world is changing, and how radically it's changing, and how it's ever more important to get, especially students, on the right side of change, so that they can enjoy these incredible growth opportunities and not be disrupted by industries that will be sunsetting, shall I say? Kathy, a three to five year time horizon means not only kind of mid-term or recession-proofing your companies. You're not just recession-proofing your portfolio. You're also kind of mid-term-proofing your portfolio. You're a general election-proofing your portfolio. And so, you know, Eric, how do you go about identifying disruptive innovation that then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda? Well, we have a six-metrics scoring system.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,36,2022-10-14 16:32:01
3330," then doesn't get disrupted by public policy or political agenda. Well, one, we have a six metric scoring system, very much focused on innovation. One of the scores is thesis risk. Thesis risk has a lot to do with government policy. And so in the, in the early days of arc in 2014, 15, we were thinking, okay, government may be very concerned about the safety of autonomous vehicles. But as we've moved through these last eight years, what we've seen, thankfully, is the government and regulators in particular very focused on data. And what does the data say? The data says that most fatalities and accidents, 85, almost 90% of them are caused by a human error. If we take the human being out of the equation, then we're going to save up to 35, 40,000 lives in the United States, the fatalities per year, and up to 1.25 million around the world. So that is a noble goal. And we've been very gratified to see the regulators looking at the fatalities in Tesla's vehicles and informing us that for the most part, most of those fatalities were caused by human error. And for the second, that people who are driving Tesla vehicles are much safer thanks to the various automated driving capabilities now. Up to 40% safer than in most other cars. So we're very focused on what governments are studying in terms of the data. And if they stick to the data, innovation typically solves problems and makes the world a better place. Really, always a treat to get some time with you. Kathy Wood, ARC, Invest Founder, and see you. Always nice to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Appreciate the time. Thank you, Ryan. Julie as well. Thank you. America has long run on Duncan, but a change in the company's rewards program has some loyalists rethinking where they go for their a Java run. Let's talk more about all things Duncan and what's on the menu here with Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Scott, great to get some time with you coming to us from inside a Duncan location. Curious on what you're seeing in traffic? There's so much economic cross-currents coming at consumers right now. What does that breakfast day part look like? Yeah, and first of all, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and can't wait.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,37,2022-10-14 16:36:08
3331," So much economic cross currents coming at consumers right now. What does that breakfast day part look like? Yeah, first of all, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and can't wait to talk about our new loyalty program, Duncan Rewards. In terms of traffic, you know, been listening to your segment all morning on inflation and everything that's going on with the consumer. We feel really good about the breakfast segment. We feel really good about our brand and how we stand tall. People need their coffee and their breakfast sandwich to start their morning. So we've seen really strong results for our brand in the last couple of months. Scott, full stop. I was critical to changes in the Rewards program, but it's coming from a place of love. I have to dunk an app. I go to dunking all the time and a lot other people seemed to have caught my vibe. Have you looked at what you made here and are making any changes now to respond to consumers? Yeah, so and I know it comes from a place of love from you, Brian. Absolutely. Here's what I would say. We rolled out our Duncan Perks program in 2014 and we haven't made any changes in the last eight years. And we went out and we talked to our core users and we said, what do you want from a program? And they said they wanted three things. They wanted more variety because in the old program, you could just get a beverage. They wanted more flexibility. And we've now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves. They can buy a sandwich for their family or a whole meal for the soccer team. And they said they wanted recognition. So big users like you want to be recognized and we now have a boosted status. And so we've put those three things in place. We're really excited about this new program. We gave out four billion free points in the last three days. And the response has been overwhelming with positive. Okay, fair enough. That's good to hear. But the birthday drink is the industry standard. Like I know I would like to get a free birthday coffee until I ultimately dropped dead and six feet on your, I mean, do you think you'll bring that back? So we're talking about that for sure, Brian. But one thing we did do is, well, we did take that piece away. What we added is come in either the day before your birthday, the day of your birthday or the day after, get three times points, points that won't expire as long as you come a couple times a year. And you can actually get something besides just a beverage. You could get a donut, you could get a sandwich, you can get avocado toast, a lot more flexibility, which is what our guests wanted. So you're really monitoring some of the taste profiles, the trends on what consumers are moving towards in their purchases for anything from lunchtime to starting off the day. So where are you still seeing the most traffic at what point in the day to really make some of the menu decisions and changeovers there? Yeah, we're certainly a morning day part business. So 70% of our business happens before 11 a.m. And honestly, when COVID happened and we had that shutdown, we were all very nervous when the commute was not happening. But people shifted their behaviors a little bit and they came to us a little later in the morning and they came for a couple beverages, maybe to share with their spouses while they're working at home. But really, the trend that's happening is all around ice beverages. And we invented ice coffee. We're a leader. Whether it's ice coffee, whether it's cold brew, our new refresher line, it's all about ice beverages and great attachment with snacking items to that. Hey, Scott, it's Julie here. I mean, I gotta say it's like, I guess I want to know a little bit more about the whole recession, spending patterns, et cetera, because you sound super positive. And I'm just wondering what signs if any you see a of trade down, for example, of a drop in traffic of any kind of sign that, you know, the anecdotal and data pain that we are talking about every day if you guys are seeing any evidence of that. Yeah, we do see some of it. And here's what I'd say anecdotally. What happens in our business is when things happen like fuel prices or you see other spikes in inflationary environments, people pull back a little bit and maybe they stop coming quite as frequently to a Duncan or some other restaurant. But especially with Duncan, I think after a couple days or a week, people realize they need their morning Joe to get started, right? They need their coffee to fuel their day and we've seen it come right back up. And I think uniquely positioned for us, Duncan, it is a value offering, right? So we've got great products, both beverage and food at a great price point at the speed of Duncan. I think that's an unmatched combination out there. Scott, I go to my local Duncan every Saturday. It's just a ritual I have. And every time I'm in line, why don't you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,38,2022-10-14 16:40:57
3332," Duncan, I think that's an out there. Uh, Scott, I go Duncan every Saturday, I have and every time I'm in line, launch a huge in the morning, which is a good thing I'm sure, but everybody's buying coffee notably ice coffee. How big a percentage is donuts now on your business? And what does that menu look like? Yeah, donuts are about 20% of our product mix right now. You're right. Ice coffee is the future of the day. And I think that last year was the first year we sold more ice beverages than hot beverages. That's what the next generation of consumer wants. They want these ice cold beverages. They want highly colorful products that they can share on Instagram. But I will say our donuts. No one does donuts like we are. We are obviously a national and a global leader on donuts. You got to come try our spider donut, which we just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out. We just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out for Halloween. We just rolled out for Christmas. And when it comes to the first year, we have a number of donuts. I think we're going to have one more time that I don't have. As you've got more people returning either to office or to schools that breakfast was that's continuing to brew and and heat up. What's Duncan's positioning in that breakfast the digital value. So through our app, we're going to have the ability to have laser focused offers that go right to you and what you want and give you incredible value in our program. And then the last thing I'd say is we've got it through our app our ability to order ahead. So Brian, when you see those long lines, you download the app, order ahead, it'll be ready when you get there and the crew will hand it to you and you'll be off and running for your busy day. Scott, I just I need the birthday drink back. I'm going to dunk it anyway, lad. I'm going to get off of here. I'm going to dunk it on your birthday. I just need the birthday drink back. Please, please. Brian, I'm going to come deliver coffee to you personally on your birthday. I'll take that April 4th. There we go. Done deal. Duncan, President Scott Murphy. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Appreciate it. you you you. We're going to talk to Wall Street plenty. Let's just speak to Main Street for a minute who's just confused because we get a we get a bad inflation print. We get a good reaction from the market. We get a great job report. And the market through the opposite. Tell Main Street what to make of today. Yeah. Well, first off, thanks for having me on a day where things are green. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,39,2022-10-14 16:45:37
3333," and the market through the opposite, tell Main Street what to make of today. Yeah, well, first off, thanks for having me on a day where things are green. Actually, something to talk about here. That's nice, nice change. But just today, we had the disappointing number, obviously markets were lower, but you look at what happened, we just corrected 50% of the overall bull market that we had off those 2020 lows, okay? 3,500. That's a normal type of retracement. So we found some buyers there, wasn't shocking. The VIX, the fear gauge. It didn't, surprisingly, didn't spike massively higher this morning. And then that would be a clue. The obvious market knew something and the rally came on. Last thing for Main Street, the people are really worried. Believe me, you're not the only ones confused. This year is very confusing for a lot of people. But think about this. In June 16th, we made those lows 200 approximately, 200 stocks in the S&P made a new low. Just yesterday, we made new lows less than 80 stocks, made 52 week lows. What does that mean? Price is making new lows, but less stocks are. That Main Street, everyone listening is an improvement. That's how major lows conform. There's less stocks going down, and that's a real positive sign. Well, Ryan, speaking of that positive sign, the Dow up over 3% S&P not too far behind, NASDAQ up over 2.5%. Do you think today's gains does this rally that we're seeing have legs? Yeah, we think it does. I mean, there's lots of ways we can look at this, right? I mean, I mentioned the VIX. You look at sentiment polls. We're near some of the most bearers we've seen, guys, since major lows, March 2009, March 2020. Expectations are so low. It's not like things are great. Believe me, we're going to see this earnings season how corporate America is looking. Roptimistic earnings are still going to justify this economy growing. But expectations have just simply gotten so low. And let's not forget this. Look at the last 17 bear markets, six of them bottom in October. Believe me, it could be random, maybe not. October is more of a bear market killer. The worst two-starth year ever, other than this year, this is the third-war start, 74 in 2002, all right? Bottom in the first two weeks, two weeks of October. Did we just do it again? Believe me, tune in and watch later. But we think we're optimistic that we can have another pretty good low in October. And in those regular fourth quarter strong seasonals that take place in a midterm year can take over. And we can have a pretty good size rally the rest of this year before the year is all set and done. And Ryan, how about the fact that it's a midterm election? Yeah, what are investors hoping for in this sort of environment? Yeah, great question. So let's put it this way. I think gridlock, right? You don't want too much power one way or the other. And you look at the way the election, how it might swing. You know, you know, the incumbent party that won the presidency, tends to lose some seats. But we don't think there's going to be too much power one way or the other. And that could be what matters. But for the average investor listening, just know this. We say do not invest in your politics, right? Just invest in the fundamentals. But think about this. If you looked at what the S&P did, the day of the midterm elections, go back to World War II, all right? One year later, the S&P was higher every single time, up 14.1%. So whatever happens, markets hate uncertainty. Get that election out of the way, the uncertainty out of the way. Then markets tend to do pretty darn well. Last point on this, the second year of a new president. So this year, historically, extremely weak. Believe me, this year's weaker than we expected. At the same time, this isn't abnormal to see weakness the second year of a new president. And things get a lot better that third year. And the economy can keep growing in our view. It should lead to pretty good size gains into this year and into next year. Don't get me wrong, man. We love to see the rally. We love your positivity. You know that. But if I said dinner on the S&P being higher in one month, then it is today, you'd say what? And that's an awful thing. Where are we going for dinner is what I would say. What I mean. OK. Some more expensive. Yeah, good steakhouse. No, I'm going to hire. I mean, believe me. So let's put it like this. October and November are the top two months in a midterm year. We talked about some of those things. I know we know inflation's high. But overall, this beach ball is really low, right? Really, really low. Once you let go, and that momentum go up, we think this time next month, you can buy me a steak. I'll come to New York. And we think the S&P is going to be a decent deal higher. I'd be happy to buy you dinner, man. If I lose this bet, and that is a bet, it's on tape. Is there anything that you see then that tells us inflation might be cooling? Yeah, I mean, believe me, this number is disappointing. Yesterday's number is disappointing. But yes, you look at some of the individual surveys, like rents. Rents are actually down month over month last year. The government data doesn't show that, because government data takes like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,40,2022-10-14 16:49:56
3334," supporting yesterday's numbers Yes, you look at some of like rents rents are actually government data doesn't show like nine months for to get cars and really start government data doesn't show that is real time when it comes potential positive just look around commodity prices have come back significantly some shining potential bright spots in a really dark see when it comes to inflation but at the same time what's priced in and what's not the market is pricing in massive inflation massively higher rates the fed is not infallible this time 15 months ago the fed saw one rate hike this year all right I'm not calling them out I'm just saying that's what it was six months from now I doubt if the feds will be nearly as hawkish as they are right now. When you take a look I guess what we're going to see play out in the markets over the next several weeks a big earnings with some of the bigger banks we heard from Pepsi earlier this week they were actually able to weather the sensor in environment high inflation very well what are some areas or do you think do you spot any trends just in terms of companies that are best position to weather some of the downturn that we could see even though you you have a pretty optimistic outlook here yeah that's a great point so earnings coming up right energy is supposed to have massive earnings growth we know that but the number two is industrials industrials so see over 20% you over your earnings growth you don't usually have a recession when that happens and you look under the service at industrials on a relative strength basis versus yes and p500 industrials are breaking out to like one and a half of your highs on a relative strength so to see industrials that strong under the service with small calves with gin violated the June lows with health care hanging in there with regional banks actually making new highs in relative strength things are perfect we get it but these are some shining lights and some some positives that are under there and industrials to me is a really good looking group that could be a big one or this earnings season so Ryan then for investors watching this wondering what to make of this period between now and November how should they be viewing the market where are the opportunities yeah kind of hinted at some of them so we like value over growth still your industrials your energy you know those materials I mean those those some groups still look pretty good to us we haven't liked big cap tech for a while more neutral at best I just look at this multi-year running growth right in technology some of these names still look kind of top heavy honestly so we like kind of small caps look pretty good in value those are some areas we still like just big picture this big bear market that we've had we think you know this time six to twelve months or down it's cliche to say but there are some really good opportunities and honestly look at small caps small caps are historically cheap relative to large caps that's another positive we think there all right lots of great stuff a big thank you Ryan Dietrich for joining us this afternoon have a good one you all right well that CPI print is the big story of the day",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,41,2022-10-14 16:53:48
3335," I'm going to be back. All right, well, that CPI print is the big story of the day coming in much hotter than expected inflation rising 8.2% in September and a year or year basis. We want to bring in Vince Reinhardt, Drifus and Melon, a chief economist. Vince, it's great to see you. So certainly it's interesting when you take a look at the market's reaction, but from an economist perspective, I guess the this change your outlook at all, just where we are in the economy right now and what we could expect in the coming months. No, it just seals the deal for what the Fed will be doing in the near term 75 basis points that it's upcoming meeting in November and other 50 in December. What it tells you is that inflation, once it gets high, gets entrenched. The worrisome thing about the Consumer Price Index report this morning was core inflation. Strip out food and energy. That's growing 6.6%. That's a 40-year high. It's getting into the prices of goods and services that are sticky and sticky lives up to its name. Hard to bud, but once they start going, they have momentum and that's the Fed's problem inflation is broader based now. We know that the Fed is playing catch up and at this point they want to do too much rather too little to really get inflation under control. When you pass through some of the minutes that we just recently gone, how does that factor into some of these data points that are going to continue to come out? I think that this is the last CPI print we're going to see before the midterms. You're exactly right. That was the headline they wanted out of the minutes that were published yesterday. FOMC participants basically said you could do too much, you could do too little. There's more danger if you don't do enough. While they fred it a little bit about what it means economic activity, they were much more concerned about inflation getting embedded and inflation expectations rising. Right now, monetary policy choice is pretty easy. It's unpleasant, but it's easy because when inflation is so far above your 2% goal, they all know what to do. What they need to do is raise rates and that's what they'll be doing. They'll be doing tighter longer and just about every CEO in the conference boards suggest a mild recession next year and just about every guest on this show says the same. But Vince, is that going to be enough to drive down inflation? We're seeing earnings at least early on that show people there's no demand destruction despite dramatically higher prices. What will bring down inflation to 2% of its just mild? We get anywhere near it. Ultimately it would be the Federal Reserve that returns inflation to its goal by being willing to keep the policy rate high for a long time. I actually don't think they'll get there next year and that is because inflation is stubborn and as you say, the economy slips into a recession when the unemployment rate starts rising as inflation gets nearer to their goal, not near enough to it. They're going to have much more difficult policy choices and chances are they'll blink. They won't keep rates high enough to get inflation back to 2. They'll satisfy themselves that inflation in the neighborhood of 2, even if it starts with a 3, is sufficient progress to ultimately get to their goal. And Vince, you've been in the room before you've been part of the very similar types of discussions. What do you tell us? What do you think the conversations are like now inside the Fed when we do get a print like today's? So I think it's a combination of what I alluded to earlier. A lot of unanimity when inflation is so high, the urge to tighten is across all FOMC participants. But you're beginning to see them put markers down about the next fight. And the next fight is next year when the unemployment rate is rising, when the economy is in recession, some of them are going to want to slow the process down. And so underneath all that good feeling, underneath them all saying the same thing about the need to raise rates a lot in front load policy accommodation is a beginning of this showing of the scenes. Where they're worried, where there'll be a difference of opinion, where's the show up, concerns about the right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,42,2022-10-14 16:58:13
3336," of this showing of the scenes. Were there worried where there'll be a difference of opinion? Were it set show up? Concerns about arising on employment rate or recession and global economic recession. That's back on the board now, particularly this week when the IMF and the World Bank annual meetings are ongoing. They're all going to the same meetings. They're all here in the same thing. Yes, you need to tighten. You also need to be aware that everybody is tightening monetary policy and their significant risks of financial stability. And then obviously the IMF releasing their global outlook, seeing reduced growth. Also in some of the major economies expecting a slow down there, they talked about the EU, China, and the US. How do you see the fact that we're such an interconnected world now with our economies? How do you see that playing out in terms of the pressure it might put on the US economy? A lot. And it's not global monetary policy and carbon date. A coordination is actually emulation. When the Fed raises interest rates, it puts upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar. It puts downward pressure on everybody else's exchange rate, which is a force for inflation in Europe, in Japan, in emerging markets. Most central banks don't like it, and they're forced to follow the Fed up. So part of the message this week is recognize Fedors or we're all following you. That means your footprint is bigger on the global economy than you may appreciate. And that problems in the global economy will blow back to the US economy. That's the concern about next year. And as I want to close with the housing market, now mortgage rates certainly don't rise and fall dramatically with rates for more than 10 years, but needless to say another 75 point hike is probably going to take us above 7%. What do you see in the housing market? What do you think the Fed sees? It appears to be the first breaking point. So look, the Fed's got to work the tools it has in terms of the monetary transmission mechanism. There's basically two reliable features. You raise rates, you choke off housing, you raise rates, you tend to put upward pressure on the exchange rate of the dollar. That's unpleasant for people looking for homes. And it's unpleasant for our trading partners facing downward pressure on their own exchange rates. I would think that housing is going to be troubled for a while. And the place to see that is actually abroad. In the UK, where more of mortgage activity is at variable rates, you see a much more sharper contraction activity. Indeed, you see an inability to get mortgages at some point over the last couple of weeks. That's the future for the US. It just takes longer because we rely so much more on fixed rate mortgages. But as you said, fixed rate 30-year mortgages has been more than doubled in a year. And it's going up probably into the sevens next year. Indeed it appears, Sue. All right, Vince Reinhart, appreciate your time here, sir. Thank you. I'm going to give you a big ball. To be a strong, vibrant, global power, meet a strong, vibrant, advancement-factoring industry in the United States of America. I really believe 20, 30 years from now, when we look back, or maybe even 10 years from now, when we look back at COVID, and we look at what are all the lasting negative impacts, the biggest one will be what happens to our kids. Hello, everyone, and welcome to influencers on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,43,2022-10-14 17:02:25
3337," Hello everyone and welcome to Influencers I'm Andy Sirware and welcome to our guest U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gina Romando here at the Department of Commerce Secretary Romando. Great to see you. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us. Thank you. Happy New Year. Happy New Year to you. I want to jump right in and ask you about chips and the semiconductor shortage. I know this is top of mind for you and understand where things are but also to sort of ask you about the connection between the shortages of chips and these reports of very high inflation that we've seen lately. Thank you. This is a direct correlation. I mean the inflation numbers came out yesterday and you know higher I think than anybody would want to see but if you did if you get under the covers of the numbers you realize that a third of the increase in inflation is due to car prices which is stunning you know a third is due to car prices. Why is that? Because last year auto production of cars was down by almost 8 million cars, 7.7 million cars. So supply is down, prices of cars are up 20% and the reason like the single reason or biggest reason that car production is down so much is because car companies can't get their hands on enough chips and they will tell you that. If you go to production facilities of cars and trucks by the way you will see many many cars fully assembled but for chips. So it's pretty simple supply and demand you know I'm thinking back to X10 which I took 30 years ago. It's like we need to increase the supply of cars so prices will come down and in order to do that we need to increase in semiconductor chips. So there's really a direct link between the two and we need Congress to act so they can fix the problem. And so there is the chips act out there and I'm wondering where that stands right now and then how that would address this problem. Yeah so it's kind of stalled in Congress to be very honest that the Senate worked hard, got the chips act passed and I think last summer and it's been a little bit stuck in the house. Speaker says she's for it I mean she does support it but we need to move it and so why does it matter? It is essentially it's it's incentives that the Commerce Department could provide to chips manufacturers so they will make chips in America. If you ever you know have time for kind of a really scary read you should learn more about how dependent the United States is on other countries especially Taiwan for our supply of semiconductors. Like right now in the United States we make zero none of the most sophisticated semiconductor chips none of them and we get the majority from Taiwan. So apart from the fact that we need to make chips in America so we can make more cars, we do some inflation, create jobs, it's a national security issue as well. We cannot be a secure nation economically or you know nationally secure if we get 60-70 percent of all of our chips from a single company in Taiwan. So in any event Congress needs to move they need to take action now it'll send money to the Commerce Department we'll set up a program here where we work in partnership with semiconductor companies asking them to set up shop in America making chips in America. And so would this bill then prospectively help Nvidia AMD Intel micron those US companies set up fabs here in the United States which you know cost a billion dollars they're very expensive. Yeah. And also would there be money for foreign companies as well say like Taiwan semiconductor to build facilities here. Yeah so yes and yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,44,2022-10-14 17:06:39
3338," And also, would there be money for foreign companies as well, say like Taiwan semiconductor to build facilities here? Yeah, so yes and yes. Yes and yes. We need, they cost many billions of dollars as you said. I'm dating myself. I don't remember when they cost a billion, that's a lot more than that. Yeah. It's multiple billions of dollars. And look, these companies could be building more fabs or fab is just a word for semiconductor facility where they make chips. They could build them now in Malaysia, Taiwan, lower cost settings. We want them and need them to build them in America, hiring Americans to make this stuff on our shores. And by the way, yes, we hope that one's Congress does its job and gets us the money. We hope, you know, Samsung, TSMC companies that are not American, but in allied countries, will be eligible if they put their facility in the United States of America. And just one more question about that. I mean, do you think companies really get it that the supply chain, which was optimized for cost, needs to be optimized for other factors as well, like security? Yeah, I think they get it now. I think they get it now. As you say, so well said by you. I mean, there's been an obsession for decades with just in time, you know, obsession with efficiency. And we're realizing that in a world of severe climate change events where storms can take out a manufacturing facility or pandemics or other kind of disruptions, you need redundancy. You need resilience. Frankly, you need stuff near you and near your customers, not all of it in Asia. So I think that absolutely, they've learned a very painful lesson. If you talk to folks who run auto companies or trucking companies, it's been a really brutal year. I mean, like I said, their production is down so significantly they've had to layoff workers. They have whole facilities filled with half-built cars and trucks. They can't finish them just because they can't get chips. So yeah, it's been a huge wake-up call for the private sector around how to build in resiliency, redundancy, just in case to their supply chain. Does all that speak to a decline in globalism? And you're the US Commerce Secretary. And I don't know what your thinking is on that. I mean, obviously you have China on your mind as well. And they're the political considerations that impact supply chain. So what is your thinking on that? Yeah. It does. I did listen. I think globalism isn't should be alive and well. In fact, you speak of China. I mean, the president is very clear on this. We have to work with our allies as we confront the threat and competition from China. And we have to actually do a better job of that, working with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, with our allies in Europe. That being said, look, we have, the United States, over decades, has just walked. We've watched our manufacturing base wither. I mean, quite literally, just wither. We've lost, I think, 30 percent of small and medium-sized manufacturers in America have gone out of business in the past few decades. So there is a balance. We need to work with our allies. These supply chains are enormously sophisticated and global. And they should be. That was in Malaysia at the end of last year, and I visited the semiconductor packaging facility of an American company. It's sophisticated. It's huge. Thousands of Malaysians work there. That is a good thing, but we can't make nothing in America. You know, it's just, we have to, it's the balance is out of whack. We've taken a right off the ball to be a strong, vibrant, global power. We need a strong, vibrant, advanced manufacturing industry in the United States of America with the workforce who can do those jobs. And that is a critical element.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,45,2022-10-14 17:11:05

3340," And the CDC reduced its quarantine guidance from 10 days to five days. Is that helping, do you think? I think so, yes, I think so. But still, folks got to get vaccinated. Right. I want to go back a little bit to inflation, Secretary Romando, and ask you, beyond chips, are there other factors and why is this difficult to address perhaps, or what is the best way to address it besides the chip situation? Yeah. So, obviously, the primary lever with respect to inflation is held by the Fed. So Chairman Powell and his colleagues have their work cut out for them, and I trust that they will do the right thing and use the tools in their toolbox to combat inflation. That being said, the President has been very clear with us, we have to use every tool in our toolbox to help the American people and reduce inflation. So some of that is getting all these supply chain disruptions behind us, the ports, congestion at the ports has been a huge issue. We've leaned into it. It is much better. You know, the shelves were full for Christmas. But, you know, we have to put that behind us. Anything that relates to supply, again, back to Econ 101. Supply of goods has to go up to meet demand, so prices can come down. So whether that is the actions the President took around meat processing to increase supply, you know, if meat, whether that's chips, ports, anything we're doing to increase the supply of goods will fundamentally help to dampen inflation. Also, look, there are provisions in the President's billback better package that will increase the labor supply, you asked about labor before. We have to get more folks into the workforce. Women will be able to get back to work if they have affordable childcare, if they have affordable care for their elderly loved ones. Now, that's longer term. Billback better is kind of investing now for the future. But the supply matters, supply side matters. You get more folks working. We got to increase the supply of goods, so prices come down. You sound like you're using a lot of your Econ knowledge from graduate days. Were you an Econ major? I was. I think that's right. I was an Econ major. Going back. And sometimes they ask you, does any of this stuff do you ever really use it in the real world? I do. I went on to study. I wanted to get a doctorate, so I come back to it frequently in this job. Right, absolutely. You talked about billback better. Are you optimistic about it? I am optimistic. I am realistic. I am optimistic. It's going to get done. It will get done. It'll look different. Whatever the President signs. This is a prediction I'm willing to make. The final bill, the President signs, he signs, will look different than what he proposed. Will look different than what came out of the house. But fundamentally, it will be transformative. It will make these investments in climate, in workforce, in bringing down health care costs that we need. And yes, I think it gets done. Can I ask you about broadband and expanding access to broadband? You've got two fronts there, people in urban populations who can't afford it, don't have access, and then the rural population is where it's an abomination, quite frankly. Where do you stand? That's part of your remit as well, right? It is. That's a huge piece of business here at the Department of Commerce. The bipartisan infrastructure law sent tens of billions of dollars to the Department of Commerce. Our job is to use that to make sure every American has broadband. The rural, tribal, urban. You're exactly right. The issues are different. In urban areas, it's less about access and more about affordability. I was the governor of Rhode Island. There's no rural Rhode Island. It's a very, it's urban. It's densely populated. It's fiber everywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,47,2022-10-14 17:19:53
3341," And more about affordability. I was the governor of Rhode Island. There's no rural Rhode Island. It's a very, it's urban. It's densely populated. There's fiber everywhere, but it's not affordable everywhere. So in those places, we have to work harder on affordability. Also, I'm providing digital literacy to folks. In the rural areas and tribal areas, we have to lay fiber. And we have to use other technologies. Right now, it's so heartbreaking, Andy, to spend time as I've done in rural America. There is no broadband for hundreds of miles, which means you can't work from home. You can't visit the doctor with telemedicine. Your kids can't have virtual school. When tribal lands, at West, teachers would literally drive worksheets once a week to their students. So the kids could do the work on paper and then mail it back or drive it back to the school. So anyway, yeah, we have to do it. We will do it. We'll do it in partnership with the providers. At the end of this mission, every single American ought to have high speed, affordable broadband.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,48,2022-10-14 17:24:18
3342," I also want to ask you about tech companies, big US tech companies, and their struggles with the EU and my understanding and listing your help are asking for help from you. Google, Facebook, in particular, where does that stand? Yeah, so I think everybody recognizes that there is a need for changes in the way we regulate tech companies. That being said, some of the provisions being debated in the EU feel discriminatory. They are specifically designed to only affect three or four companies in the United States of America. That doesn't feel right. What I'm saying is, yes, of course, update regulations change regulations, be pro-competition, be pro-transparency, be pro-privacy, but don't just specifically take aim at four companies in the world and also just have an open ear to some of the legitimate concerns of American and American business. That must be a tricky balance to strike. They're not just four ordinary companies, right? They're pretty remarkable with huge amounts of power and then there's people like Lena Khan who have very perhaps different perspectives, perhaps, but certainly a mandate that would suggest that their power is maybe too large. And so how do you factor that in? Yeah, and by the way, that's true. The president has been very clear about this. We are pro-competition. We do believe there's legislation working its way through the House and the Senate in America right now dealing with that. That being said, some of the provisions of what the EU is considering is, as I said, there's not taking into account some of the very real concerns related to cybersecurity and privacy and security that American companies have and we're asking the EU to have an open ear to that. Right. What part of your portfolio are people not aware of Secretary Romando? It's a big portfolio. Maybe everything we have to do with oceans and climate. So 40 percent of the Commerce Department is related to the ocean and the atmosphere. 40 percent? Yeah, it's big. It's a big piece of business what we do here and that's all of course related to climate. So I spend a fair bit of my time. I was the governor of the Ocean State in Rhode Island. Ocean State, that's right. I really love it. So you know the license plates? Exactly. In the Ocean State, I grew up going to the beach, I grew up clamming, I feel we have to preserve the treasure of our coastal lands and our oceans. So in any event, I think people probably don't realize how much the Department of Commerce has to do with resiliency, climate, oceans, undersea efforts. You talk about being governor of Rhode Island. How is this job different from that job? Yeah, it's pretty different. You know, Rhode Island is a small place and you can make things happen quickly when you're the governor. So this is obviously, you know, just the building where we're sitting is gigantic and we have almost 60,000 employees just in the Commerce Department. So I'd say that is different. In many ways though, leadership is leadership. You know, you set a vision, you manage your team, you drive to results. So in that way, it's very familiar. Working with the legislatures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,49,2022-10-14 17:28:17
3343," You know, you set a vision, you manage your team, you drive to results. So in that way, it's very familiar. Working with the legislature is also very familiar for me. I enjoy it, I like it, it's part of the job. I did that as governor, I'm doing that here. Right. When you were governor of Rhode Island, you were out front back then saying that schools should stay open. I know you're not education secretary, but what are your thoughts on what's going on with their schools right now with the pandemic? I still feel kids need to be in school. You know, these vaccines are safe. That's safety, obviously, we have to keep our teachers safe and our kids safe. No doubt about it. That means good protocols, more testing. Everyone has to be vaccinated. But with those precautions, kids ought to be in school. I really believe 20, 30 years from now, when we look back, or maybe even 10 years from now, when we look back at COVID, and we look at what are all the lasting negative impacts. The biggest one will be what happened to our kids. The mental health issues, how they have fallen behind in their education. And of course, this will just, this again will contribute to the lack of equity in America, because it'll be the children who didn't have broadband, whose parents couldn't stay home to teach them, who are already a little bit behind, who are just so much further behind. So, I have religion on this topic. I also have two teenagers, and I see it. We've got to get kids in school. There is a recent article out there talking about your future and being a bright light in the Democratic Party. I wonder what your ambitions are, Secretary Armando. To get through the week. I mean, like, I have a big, big, big, big job here. We just touched on it. So, this is what I'm focused on. All right. And finally, a sort of related question, but a little different, I hope, is, what do you see as your legacy here and maybe personally? Gosh. Wow. Here, I think this, the broadband that we talked about will be, if I do it right, my legacy. This is fundamental. You know, this is, this, this, done properly. It will be comparable to any of the biggest infrastructure implementations in our nation's history. And as I look towards, like, the economy and the divide, the digital divide, and how that plays into the economic and opportunity divide, there's a huge sense of urgency around getting broadband to everyone. So, I think in this job, that'll be a big portion of it. Focus on that. Yeah. All right. U.S. Commerce Secretary, Gina Armando, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Surwer. We'll see you next time. Welcome back. You're watching Yahoo Finance Live. We've struck this the top of the 10 a.m. hour here, Brad Smith here with Julie Heimann and you're seeing Brian Sazi on screen there as well. With 30 minutes into trade, let's take it swiftly on over to Julie Heimann, who's got some fresh news, breaking news and consumer sentiment as well. Yeah, consumer sentiment coming out better than estimated from the University of Michigan's October preliminary reading 59.8 is that reading 58.8 is what analysts have been. Economists had been estimating. It's also an increase from the prior month. Current conditions, whoo, lot better than estimated 65.3. That's, economists weren't even looking for a reading above 60. There are expectations, though, are lower. So, people that feel good now, but they don't expect that they're going to continue to feel good. 56.2 is that expectations number. The one year inflation number, expectations ticking up to 5.1%, and the five to 10 year inflation expectations ticking up to 2.9%. So, pretty fascinating here. And also kind of in line with what we have been hearing, right, from corporations as well. So, kind of a confirmation that just as Jamie Dimon said today, consumers are in good shape right now, right? They're feeling good right now. The consumer balance sheet is in decent shape. People...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,50,2022-10-14 17:32:50
3344," We're done and said today, consumers are in good shape right now, right? They're feeling good right now. The consumer balance sheet is in decent shape. People are spending. It's what's happening next that people are worried about. Yeah, exactly. Continue to uncertainty over future trajectory of prices, economies, financial markets around the world, indicating a bumpy road ahead for consumers that all kind of laid out within the commentary on this as well, Sauce. Yeah, just an interesting report. And I would say, just strange, shortened to the point better than expected. Doesn't really, I would say, job with the retail sales report, but nonetheless a good read on the consumer. Welcome, read for the consumer ahead of the start to the holiday. Shopping season. But let's get back under earning season, which is now officially in full swing. Results from the JP Morgan City Morgan Stanley and of course, Wells Fargo. David Allison runs point on the Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund. David, market has seemed, at least initially, seemed to like some of these big bank earnings. Do you think that enthusiasm is justified? Well, I think the stocks have been down a lot. So the fact that they're up a little bit tells me that the world didn't come to an end again. So I think the stocks have been really bad. And so the fact that they're rebounding is sort of a sigh of relief. I think generally the fundamentals are good. I mean, obviously the margin is expanded because rates are moving up and there are primary beneficiary of that. But what you're not seeing is any real credit deterioration. So you've had a massive move in rates. You've had a massive move in the market that has gone down that's taken money away. Sentiment is not great on Wall Street. And yet you don't really see any movement in credit. So it's interesting to note how strong these banks are, even though we have this fear of recession in the end of the world that seems to be the talk every day. Yeah, I mean, the end of the world trade can at least from what I've been told only be right once. And you hope that we don't reach that point. But when you think about some of the activity even that we're seeing here on the day as well, David, as the markets have slipped back into negative territory there, we had a moment to go all three major averages in negative territory. After beginning the day, pretty strong, and what seemed like would be another add on to yesterday's momentum, even though it was a whipsaw day yesterday, as you kind of look into the rest of this quarter, what would you need to see in order to have some confidence that a bottom had been set in during this fourth quarter going into what economists are expecting in a recession at the midpoint sometime 2023? Well, my general broad thoughts are that we've had a pretty good move in rates. Two years ago, I think the two year was like 15 basis points, and now it's four plus percent. So I think we're through the bulk of the rate increases, meaning we're not going to go to eight or 10 percent on a three-month T-bill. At least that's my opinion. I think what we're heading into now is an earnings issue for all of the companies, not all of them, but enough of them. Obviously, the financials aren't seeing any earnings issues. There's concern that there will be that rates will go up, credit will kick in, loan demand will decline. And I think it would be interesting to see what happens the next couple of weeks as the non-financial start to report and tell you what's happening away from the financial economy. Even the banks came into this downturn very strong, very conservative. They haven't made, they don't want to make bad loans. They've got plenty of capital. They're benefiting from the rise in rates in the NIM. So this group is not really indicative of what's happening out there in the marketplace yet. Well, there are some hints of it, right? If you look at this, David, in JP Morgan, for example, yes, net interest income doing fantastically, but if you take out net interest income, revenue actually didn't do as well. They're raising their provisions for credit losses. They're seeing a decline in lending already. How much worse do you think some of those indicators, even if the banks are going to get worse? Well, I guess as an investor in these stocks to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,51,2022-10-14 17:37:08
3345," to get worse. Well, I don't, you know, it's, I guess, as an investor in these, in these stocks to be completely honest, I am looking forward to credit troubles. I am looking forward to higher rates. I am looking forward to the market getting very concerned about the health of the banking industry because that's going to generate the opportunities for me to buy the better names and outperform on the way up. So, you know, that's the, that's the raw truth of what I do is, you know, I don't want what we have now to continue because I can't really compete with the other companies in the marketplace that grow, they create new products. We need cycles for this industry to really make money for investors. And my hope, again, I'm, you know, I've been doing this for 40 years, you know, I'm hoping we have a downturn, I'm hoping we have a recession, I hope we have higher non performers that creates lower stock prices that I can buy as the economy recovers, the Fed if it's and all that stuff. Okay, so David, tell us what. So, what are the better names then? What are the ones that you're looking to get cheaper? What are the ones you're most excited about getting cheaper in this kind of tumultuous period? Well, the ones that, you know, are going to have credit problems. And I don't think the, you know, the bigger companies are going to have that. They've just been too conservative, they're too liquid. So the smaller banks, you know, the mid, the mid tier banks, maybe not the real small ones where they've made loans, loaned to deposits are higher, they don't have as much liquidity. If credit kicks in on a negative thing, then they'll hopefully go down a lot more and I'll be able to buy them. But right now, there's no problems in the industry. And this is the frustrating part for an asset manager. If there's no problems, there's nothing to get better. There's no reason for the stocks to go up. So we need things to go wrong for this group to get really attractive. And right now, you, the first eight, four or five companies that have reported everything's great. Non performers are okay. Lone growth is okay. Yeah, they're preserving, they're reserving here and there. But they're just being super conservative. And I would do the same thing. You know, so, you know, we'll see what happens. But I think you'll see more issues with, with the economy in the non financials for the next couple months. I think that the struggle, the real challenges in the, in the world is not the financial system. It's away from the financial system. David Wells Fargo is the top 10 holding in the fund. Does that company frustrate you? They had a couple I would argue two good comeback quarters to kick off this year. They come out here this morning. I would argue, expense are still high. They announced a charge. The home business under pressure, auto is under pressure. What do you make of that name? Well, it's a, again, it's a, it's a large, again, it's a, you know, this is a large cap fund. So I'm not going to own a $2 billion bank. So you have to own something big. But this is a, the valuation is reasonable. They've got a great historical franchise. They've had some management issues for the last four, five years, which have been very frustrating, not quite as bad as city court. But certainly, they've had some struggles. And the valuation is just too cheap to ignore. And the embedded franchise value of those deposits is just too large and too powerful. And you're seeing the benefit of those deposit franchises now in higher net interest income. Just while we have you here as well, David, there's an interesting tidbit within the consumer sentiment survey that come out just a moment ago. And particularly as we think about the consumer and the higher end, or higher net income consumer as well, if you see them start to be impacted to the same kind of detriment, or maybe not the same detriment. But as they're citing your negative influence on their personal finances, the highest in five months, what does that start to spell out more broadly about where consumer mindset in the economy is trending towards? Well, presumably, the Fed is doing, or is making things happen the way it wants to have them happen, meaning they're slowing the economy down. And that's showing up in certain things. Obviously stock prices are down, home prices have stopped going up 2% a day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,52,2022-10-14 17:41:31
3346," happen, meaning they're slowing the economy down, and that's showing up in certain things. Obviously, stock prices are down, home prices have stopped going up 2% a day. So I think the issue here is who's going to really feel it more? And I just don't believe that the financial, the large financial companies, the banks, are going to feel the real bite of this recession, at least not yet. It's going to be the other companies. It's going to be the companies that have reported, even you look at Nike and you look at, those companies are going to hurt a lot more than the banks are. The banks since 2008 have been in a box, they've been regulated, they've been forced to be liquid, forced to be conservative, forced to have tons of capital, and now that's paying dividends for them in a sense that they're not seeing the struggles. So you're not really seeing what's happening yet in the economy, and I think the financials are not a good example of that yet. And so I think the numbers you're seeing are going to impact the non-financial a lot more than the financial phone. David Ellison, who runs point at the Hennessey large cap financial fund.

Get a present at Mary Daley. You won't want to miss it. We'll be right back. There's nothing better to say. All right. Thank you.....",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,53,2022-10-14 17:46:11
3347," Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Jennifer Sean Burger. Well, on the back of that hot CPI report that showed a core reading, rising to the highest level in 40 years, investors are wondering what this means for the Fed and if they'll get more aggressive. Here to weigh in is Mary Daley, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. President Daley, welcome back to the program. So wonderful to have you. It's wonderful to be here. I look forward to it. So I want to kick off this conversation and get your reaction to that CPI report and whether it changes the course of policy for you. If we look at the reading on inflation, it appears to be actually moving in the wrong direction, right? We saw core inflation, which excludes those volatile energy and food prices rise 6.6% last month up from 6.3 in August and 5.9 in July. Do you still see the Fed funds rate rising somewhere on the order of 125 basis points this year or does the Fed need to get more aggressive on the back of this report? Sure. And you know, the CPI is one part of the dashboard of indicators we look for. It's an important one and it does show the data not cooperating. It was a very disappointing report, but I would offer it wasn't that surprising, right? We would hope that inflation would start to come down faster, but I was prepared for it to just be sluggish in its response. It's a lagging indicator. And so what I'm also looking at is what's going on in the inputs to inflation are demand and supply showing any signs of coming back in balance. And here I would offer two things that you see the labor market cooling. It's still very strong, but it's cooling. You also see housing demand cooling. So the housing market is softening. And then today's retail sales report, which had showed flat spending is really another sign that we're getting some cooling and that we will eventually feed through to inflation. So my own sense is that we went in, I went into this, uh, intermeeting period, if you will, thinking that we needed to continue to raise rates to further restrict the economy and we'll have to be data dependent about what actual rate hikes we take because we have domestic conditions, but we're also working in a global economy. And there's a lot of, you know, uncertainty and risks out there. And we have to think about those in the context of exactly what we do, but there's literally no doubt in my mind that we need to put more restrictive stance of policy in the economy to further get demand and supply and balance so that consumers don't have to worry about such high inflation month after month. So given that you think this is a bit of a lagging indicator and you do see some signs of cooling elsewhere in the economy, does this keep the fed basically on course for what's been set out for the next couple of meetings or what's your sense there? Well, let's go back to the summary of economic projections, lovingly called the SEP. And that, you know, often isn't, it is stale right after it's produced, but in this case, I think that's a really good guidepost from our last meeting about what the path of policy is likely to look like. And then it's all about how do you get there? What's the path? And, you know, the SEP, if you remember it, it came out in between four and a half and five percent rates as the best estimate of what rates would be at the end of next year. And it also said that we could get up, you know, into the into the fours, into restrictive territory by the end of this year. And I still think that's a reasonable, really reasonable way to think about it. And I'm quite certain that some judicial restriction is going to take place. And I do know that that's right for the economy. We are tightening into a strong economy. And so we need to bring it back down to something that looks a lot more sustainable in terms of the pace of growth. Okay. So then to be clear, 125 basis points higher on that, but, but, funds rate this year. And then looking at a peak of around four and a half to five percent next year, still seems to be the run of play in your mind. Is that correct? Well, what I would say, Jennifer, and I just want to be crystal clear. I know people would like us to write down the exact numbers for the rest of the period. But there's too much uncertainty for that to be prudent for us. We need to be data dependent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,54,2022-10-14 17:50:13
3348," want to be crystal clear. I know people would like us to write down the exact numbers for the rest of the period, but there's too much uncertainty for that to be prudent for us. We need to be data dependent, extremely data dependent. So clearly the domestic data are pointing to further rate hikes. And I'm very supportive of continuing to put restrictions in place. I see the SCP is a good starting point guide post for people to say that's generally where the Federal Reserve will be heading. That's consistent with my own views. But I also want everyone to hear. I'm listening to recognize that we're not on a preset course. We are a data dependent fed. And if more is necessary, we'll take it if less is necessary. We'll adjust. But we're not talking about at this point in my mind, you know, pausing or stopping. Nor are we talking about, you know, changing our overall strategy because the data are coming in about like we would expect monetary policy acts with a lag. Inflation is a laggy indicator. It is a hardship that continues to print so high and I am very focused on that hardship. And I'm very mindful as my context tell me all the time that we want to make sure that price increases that inflation doesn't become embedded in psychology. And that's why you'll hear me say again and again, we are res live as an FOMC as a fed at restoring price stability. Even that you said monetary policy operates with a lag, you still think he would raise up to about 4 and a half 5% and then pause at that point in 2023. Well, I think that's exactly the question we have in mind and then why there's a big difference between what rate you get to and then holding it that you holding the economy in a restrictive stance of policy also continues to bridle it. So we'll end at a rate that we think is appropriate in in terms of where to stop and look around. But we still need to get the rates up before we ever do that and then we'll go to what I would think of as what I call oftentimes a raise and hold strategy where we raise it and then we let that sit for a while. But we are always even in that raise and hold piece adjusting to the economic conditions as they come in. We are not on some sort of course that can't correct if the economy needs more bridling or needs less bridling, but really that's how I think about it. Get you between 4 and a half and 5 is the most likely outcome and then raise to those levels and then hold at that point for some period of time. You said there is a narrow path to engineer a soft landing for this economy. There is a window for that. You think it is possible. That said this week we heard that the IMF downgraded its global outlook. It says the worst is yet to comment it warned about over tightening from global central banks and the possibility of precipitating an unnecessarily harsh global recession. At the same time we also heard from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond who believes we could see a recession in the next nine months or sooner given the impact of inflation on the consumer. They also said in their earnings report that they're setting aside 800 million for loan loss reserve. My question is where do you pin the odds of a recession in the next six to 12 months. It is fascinating to me that we continue to be asked mostly by the media and others about recession. When I'm out in my context of nine western states that travel all over the United States, I'm not hearing signs of recession. I'm hearing signs that we would like to grow more but we can't find workers or consumers saying when is inflation going to go away. My life would be great if we didn't have such high inflation. People have plenty of jobs opportunities. We still have a strong labor market. We have good consumer spending even though it's flat. People are spending. People are doing things that they want. But inflation is the troubling thing. I also point to one more data point that you didn't mention yesterday. I believe the conference board came out with their CEO survey and those CEOs 98% expected some sort of a slowdown. But they all, you know, what I remember from the report that was really meaningful and it's consistent with what I hear when I talk to business contacts workers, community groups, is that people expect the slowdown to be there, but they expected to be short lived and not very deep. And that's a very different landing. That would I in my mind is the soft landing we're trying to achieve. We need to slow GDP.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,55,2022-10-14 17:54:34
3349," for lived and not very deep. And that's a very different landing. That would, in my mind, is the soft landing we're trying to achieve. We need to slow GDP growth substantially to get us back in demand supply balance. The labor market needs to cool further. We're adding over 200,000 jobs per month in the last report. And that's another 100,000 over what it takes to just keep things steady, to just absorb the new entrance that come into the labor market. So clearly we're running fast demand and sluggish supply. Those things have to come back into balance. The Fed's tool, while it's blunt, it does directly affect the strength of demand. And we're committed to bringing demand back in line with supply. You mentioned that business executives expected there is a recession. It would be a milder one. How deep of a recession is the Fed willing to tolerate as you try to quell inflation and bring it down? And frankly, as a recession, what's needed to really get inflation under control? You know, that's not how I think about my work. Actually, we have a dual mandate, full employment and price stability. My job, as I see it, is to treat those like they are. For most people, those things are related. They don't want only one or only the other. And so our job is to ensure that we can get a balance of both, get jobs. Everyone who wants a job can find one, even if it takes a little bit longer as the unemployment rate moves up. They're still going to find a job. And inflation comes back down to something closer to 2% in next year, something closer. And then gets to 2% in the course of the next two years. Those are critical things for us to achieve. And so I'm not thinking of it in terms of recession. I do think of it in terms of cooling the economies and the demand and supply come back into balance. And Americans can go to bed at night and get up in the morning, not worried about whether the prices they pay today are no longer going to be there tomorrow. And they're not going to be able to afford the basic things they need to have their lives and livelihoods. That's what I think. I do want to ask, I do want to ask you about one other economic scenario since inflation has proven pretty sticky. And if that does expect below trend growth this year and for the next couple of years, as your hiking rates to pool the demand side of the economy, what's the risk that a stagnationary environment could emerge and how would the committee approach that? Well, so again, I think of stagnation. That's a, it's frankly a big scary word. But look at the consumer sentiment that came out today. It's rose. And then the future expectation slowed, of course, for growth. But that's consistent with what the economy needs. I think of what we're doing now as bringing inflation down so that we can have a durable expansion. And we know that durable expansions are the ones that are best for the labor market, best for all the groups that we care a lot about. And that high inflation is a tax, a regressive tax. That's literally eating away at the lives and livelihoods of Americans least able to bear it. So when I think of that, I think of slower pace of growth, delivers lower inflation, puts us back in balance, gets us in the best position to grow once again at trend. And I don't have any data right now that suggests that that's not possible. President Daly, I want to thank you so much for your insight, so appreciate it, and hope to talk with you again soon. I look forward to it. Thank you so much. Thanks so much. That's Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. We'll be right back.

3350," [""Singatures"". In哲 association with Welcome back to Yahoo Finance, everyone. The US retail spending came in flat in September, however, consumer sentiment coming in above estimates, even as Americans' expectations for inflation, they worsened. For more, on the state of the economy, we have Stephen Rashido, who is the Mizzouho America's Chief US Economist. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, just help us break down the market reaction that we've seen over these past two days to some of the economic data that really factors in everything from prices that consumers are paying to the sentiment from consumers right now. Well, I think when you're looking at the overall economy in this environment, you have to keep in mind, too, thanks. One thing is, if the economy is showing more resilience, then people had expected, given the pace of Fed rate hikes, that's number one. But we often forget that they've only been tightening since March of this year. So it's what, seven months into the process and the shortest possible lag between monetary policy and economic impacts of six months. That's the shortest possible lag. It's a long and durable lag, then need to be sometimes to the much longer lag. So the fact that we're continuing to see inflation remaining stubborn on the upside and we're continuing to see a more resilient underlying economy, always back into the fact that the labor market has not had any major significant change. And this is the critical issue. The labor market continues to be a critical piece of the equation to get inflation down and to slow the pace of underlying economic activity. And in an environment in which we're dealing with a real labor market shortage, it's really hard to do this. And therefore, there's going to be much more additional rate hikes coming down the pipeline from the Federal Reserve. Steve, I don't know if you were able to catch it, but we just had San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley on and she gave a range of potential rates where they would like to go potentially 4.5% to 5%. If we reached that 5% level, is the US economy still growing and by how much? Well, again, I actually have a higher terminal rate at this particular juncture than President Daley has. And that's not surprising. The SEP issue was quoting, did not take on board the latest inflation numbers or the latest retail sales numbers or for that matter, the latest weekly unemployment claims numbers. And the answer to your question is the economy could still be growing because we're going to be there by the end of this year and early next year. So it might not be into the real recessionary environment until we get into the second quarter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,57,2022-10-14 18:03:21
3351," just we're going to be there by the end of this year in early next year. So it might not be into the real recessionary environment until we get into the second quarter of 2023, given the underlying resilience in the economy. So the answer is we're going to have to see higher rates than are currently discounted in the marketplace and higher rates than she's discussing in her commentary a few minutes ago. Steven, it's Julie here. We've had a lot of folks come on the show and say the Fed is not quite looking at the right indicators and that that means there is this big risk of overshooting. But it sounds like you think the Fed should be even more aggressive or will end up being more aggressive here. So what indicators are you watching right now is sort of giving us a good snapshot of what's going on? Look, and watch the weekly initial unemployment claims numbers. They are the best real-time measure that we're looking at in terms of labor market. And what we're seeing is, yes, people may be losing their jobs, but they're getting alternative jobs very quickly and not showing up either in the claims numbers or showing up in the continuing claims numbers. The labor market is the key here. And given the fact that we have a real labor shortage, this is the battle that the Federal Reserve is fighting against. And this is the battle that they have to win before they can get any declines of inflation that are going to be considered sustainable on an ongoing basis. And until we get there, we're not... Two of those things we're going to know it when we get there. We're not going to be able to forecast it ahead of time. So all this analysis that we're doing about what the terminal rate should be really... It has to be viewed against the live input of data coming in, which is why people at the Fed like President Daly are telling you, we're data dependent. And what we see so far is nothing has really changed that would change our view with regard to monetary policy. And I tend to agree with them as well. Steve, you said in your notes to us that the... By the dip strategy here is misguided. What is misguided about it? And is it still for those who are asking themselves, should I be buying this dip? Is the answer from your perspective still knowing? And the answer is yes, it's still knowing. And the reason for this markets don't really yet discount what's going to come. There are going to be corporate failures. There are going to be banks that have significant problems. There is going to be economic pain that comes about as a result of what the Fed is doing. But the Fed really has no alternative, which is the other thing. See, people seem to think the Fed has an alternative. There is no alternative to what they're doing. Allowing inflation to get embedded in the system is a long-term problem that is going to require even more pain down the road. So the Fed's prescription is take your medicine now, get it over with, and let's get it done with. And I think they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing. And I think people keep on wanting to look through to the other side of this story. The problem is this other side of this story could be further out in the calendar that investment horizons are set to. And that's the real reason why it's misguided. Stephen Rosciutto, a Mizzouho America's Chief US Economist, always good to get some time with you. Have a good weekend. You too. Have a great weekend. Home Depot, co-op down to Bernie Marcus, slams the body of administration in a chat. I had with him about his new book. We'll have that interview. Next. Martha picked up the opportunity of Kitas.

3352," tow), I'm Deepo Co. Founder Bernie Marcus. Had some choice words for the Bonnett administration and my exclusive chat with him on his new book called Kick Up, Some Dust. He also reflected a bit on starting home depot during a period of high inflation. If you don't read history, you don't know history. We're right back where we started and we opened up during the Jimmy Carter days and inflation was 20%, interest rates was 20% to some percent. And people were struggling. Manufacturers were struggling. We opened up in the middle of this. And fortunately because of the capital market, we had cash. So we had to pay our vendors ahead of time. We paid vendors the day they delivered the product, which is uncalled for. I mean, it just doesn't happen. But we want to keep them in business. And I can tell you, there are hundreds of manufacturers who are major manufacturers today that we kept in business those days by paying our bills quickly so they could have the cash to buy product to keep their people working. And it was not an easy time. But here we are all over again. We don't learn less. Inflation is killing us. People struggling. You know, a gallon of gas versus putting food on the table is not a place you want to be. But our customers now have that. It's unfortunate. We just don't learn. Just don't learn. Do you feel as though the economy doesn't feel like the same economy that it did back in 1979? Well, it's it was easier. It was easier now to fix it than it was then. He caught her didn't have the tools. You know, he had all these people kept captive in an Iran. He had, he opact really against him. And if you remember oil and gas rationing was pretty horrible. You had numbers so you couldn't get gas if you didn't have a certain number. Well, we have a president that just doesn't believe in that. We're sitting on tons of oil and gas and he doesn't allow us to drill. This is the rocket device. I Now have someone in your friends in your city.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,59,2022-10-14 18:12:41
3353," Now, we have a president that just doesn't believe in that. We're sitting on tons of oil and gas, and he doesn't allow us to drill. It's basically stupid. I can't come up with another word. It's stupid. And we will continue to suffer this inflation, and our people will continue to struggle with high prices. As long as he maintains this facade of climate control versus allowing us to do the things that we should be doing, I don't know. I have people live on a different planet, I think. I feel one day I wake up in the morning and say, where the hell are they coming from? I don't understand it. Why are they defending, not drilling, when in fact climate change? We could put it off over a period of time and do it over the next 30 years, 40 years, and do it intelligently, but not slam down on it and kill everybody today. So it's hurting everybody today, not good. I know you're a big free market guy, Bernie. I mean, that's how you created or helped create Home Depot. Do you mention capitalism a couple minutes ago? Do you think capitalism is under attack in this country? Oh, yes. It's under attack in universities. You have professors who are socialists, who are teaching you to the young people. And we had a poll at one point that was very frightening because it showed that almost 50% of the young people would vote for socialism over capitalism. They just don't know. They get to their hearts, they don't get to their brains. And unfortunately, we have a whole group of people growing up today with a thinking in terms that socialism is good for America, whereas in fact capitalism is what puts food on the table. It's allowed people to grow, allow people to develop economics in independence. And they don't get it. When they get it, it's like so many friends of mine say, their kids were socialists. I put till they got their first job and they took all that money out of their paycheck to pay taxes. And all of a sudden, they became capitalist. So that may be the story. Always an entertaining, entertaining child with Home Depot, Co-founder Bernie Marcus, again, author of the new book, Kick Up Some Dust. All right.

3354," I do know that they were testing this also in the UK and in Asia and it wasn't very successful. I think that one of the big problems there is that a lot of people that are purchasing things from creators like the authenticity factor of it. They like feeling like it's just a creator going about their regular life, making videos about the things that they enjoy. And so I think if you kind of take away that natural element of it, there might be a problem. So I know they had issues getting creators on board in those other markets. So it would be curious to see how that happens here. I mean I always set up a ring light in a camera when I'm doing my plant dead duties in the house. Of course it's authentic, right? I mean but this is a big deal because TikTok reportedly they went through a round of layoffs in July. What does this new kind of e-commerce push really tell us about the future of the company here? Yeah like you said they went they you know they started off with about 1500 employees here in the US in 2020, which is pretty strong. They've been going you know at a pretty great clip ever since then but then as of July they did you know pull back and say that they were going to halt a little bit of their hiring. But I think that's just kind of following suit with what other tech companies are doing at this point. You know they're looking at the economy and they're not really sure what's going to happen. But I do think that you know a lot of their revenue right now is coming from add dollars. And so I think that they're trying to find a way to diversify the way that they're making their money. And they see so many people like millions of dollars at being spent through these affiliate networks like style link and reward style. And they just they want to get a little piece of that. Right it's all about making this advertising kind of element really attractive for the marketers out there, especially knowing that they're looking for conversions. That's why all these platforms are trying to make it more shoppable. We'll see what that looks like within TikTok. Would you buy anything on TikTok? I think so. I have you buy anything on TikTok. Yeah, okay. Oh, all right. Well, I'm behind the curve here. Thanks so much for joining us here in studio. Yeah, we'll find it in Celsipar Barbario. Coming up everyone, Julie's got this week's winners and all losers on the other side of the brick. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,121,2022-10-14 18:25:57
3355," From red hot inflation data to volatile market swings, we've seen it all this week, and Julie's got some thoughts here. It's time for our winner and loser of the week. All right, so where should we begin, Julie? Let's start the winner. Let's start with positive, right? Because maybe because I have a little more to say about the loser of the week. The winner of the week, actually, if you look in the S&B 500, the best performer on the week is Moderna. And Moderna is down again today, and it's been down quite a bit this year, something like 47-48%, but it did have a positive week up about 12%. Because the big question surrounding Moderna has been what next? Now that it proved the viability of the mRNA platform, not just it, but of course the Pfizer Beyond tech vaccine for coronavirus as well, how then was that platform going to be used? And we got one sign of that. This week, when Moderna signed on with Merck, that the two are going to try to make an mRNA-based cancer vaccine. Now it's early stages, but this is one of the early sort of concrete signs of what we're going to then see from it. So that was one of the winners of the week after the stock has been a loser this year. Soz. And this was some losers, Julie. What do you got? Okay. I got one big loser for you, and that unfortunately for those in the UK is Quasit, Quarteng, who is the now resigned fire, depending on how you want to put it, a chancellor of the checker over there, who had been really closely allied with Liz Truss. And he came out with a letter today talking about his resignation. Of course, he was really the architect, along with Truss, of their big mini budget, which among other things was going to change the check structure that came out of fire for proposing a tax structure on high earners, for example, a reduced tax structure. He sent his letter today. The economic environment has changed rapidly since we set out the growth plan on 23rd September in response together with the Bank of England and excellent officials at the Treasury. We've responded to those events. And I commend my officials for their dedication, the economic environment changed because of this plan coming out. So it's just to come out with a statement like that. Yes, the conditions continue to deteriorate in the UK in terms of inflation going higher, just like it is here in the US. But it's a little disingenuous to say the economic environment has changed rapidly when you were one of the architects of that economic environment changing rapidly. In other words, seeing really a plunge in the British pound, for example, and a lot of pension funds in the UK becoming stressed, and then the Bank of England having to step in and help them with some easing to the system. So quasi-quartong, sorry for him, loser of the week. Loser of the week there. You mentioned depending upon who you asked, whether it's fired or resigned. If it's the BBC- Oh, it's a shit out. You can't put that out. Well, the bricks, they say, sacked according to the BBC. That's it. That's it. All right, everybody. Hope you have a great weekend. A key cove, Jeeta will continue our big bank discussion on the back of those earnings reports with speed capital management, bills, and don't forget on Monday are all market summit happening. Monday, the 17th, featuring interviews with CEOs from Target, General Motors, Microsoft. You don't want to miss that. It will be a full day of very big stuff. And have a great weekend.

3356," Welcome to Yahoo Finance Live. It is 11 a.m. here in New York City. I'm a Kiko Fujita. Here's what I'm watching at this hour. Big banks kicking off earnings season this morning with JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Wells Fargo and city leading the way. We're going to break down the numbers with speed capital management, CIO, Bill Sneed in just a few minutes. Oil prices down as global recession fears and waiting demand outweigh concerns over supply. The global head of energy at KPMG joined us this hour to discuss the repercussions of the recent OPEC plus decision. And China braces for a historic party congress, President Xi Jinping, expected to secure an unprecedented third term, but concerns about a slowing economy could rain on his parade. But first let's do a quick check of the market action on this Friday. Another choppy session on our hands here after the historic turnaround rally that we saw yesterday. You see all three majors right now in the red, the Dow down 42 points, the S&P 500 down 29 and the Nasdaq down 129. Result season kicking off with some big banks announcing their Q3 numbers this morning. And that is the focus of our show JP Morgan was the headliner topping estimates thanks to higher rates. Those CEO Jamie Diamond once again pointed to hurdles and headwinds on the horizon. That's bringing Bill Sneed, Sneed Capital Management, CIO, Bill, this is kind of the super bowl for you, right? We've got all the big banks reporting today. It certainly feels like if you look at somebody like JP Morgan, we're kind of back to the discussion we had a few years ago. Last year we were talking about low loss reserves being pulled back. Now we're seeing an increase there because of the concerns on the horizon around the economy. Yeah, it's so interesting that after all the work that's been done, these banks have way more capital than they need even during a sharp recession. It's all set up that way. So you've taken the worst of the downside out of the risk associated with these companies because they have a wide mode that they have the deposits of the largest adult population group, the millennials because they have the best mobile banking apps. And now over the next 10 years, those millennials are going to be outstanding customers on the lending side. And if the world does get much tan we want to look back on the accepted share basic building order all that you will see outside. So we let them think too much about what we're looked at.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,123,2022-10-14 18:36:31
3357," population group, the millennials, because they have the best mobile banking apps. And now over the next 10 years, those millennials are going to be outstanding customers on the lending side, what they call the liability side in the business. And then the second picture you got from these reports is Wall Street is stinking and Main Street is doing well. I'll elaborate on that one for me. Well, trading and IPOs and all that kind of stuff is disappearing as a profit center. And at the same time, the average person in the United States is seeing their wages go up quite a bit. So it looks like the have-nots are going to win for a while. And that could be true of the next entire next decade, which is the way that the 1970s were where we had inflation, that have-nots were getting better bargaining position from a labor standpoint. And capital for the most part was treated very poorly unless it was invested in something that benefited from inflation. Yeah, I mean, let's talk about that bit more, Bill. I mean, JPM, one of those names that you do own. Obviously, we look to these bank earnings for any kind of color on where the economy is headed. And yet, there still does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between where sentiment is and where actual spending is. And we kind of heard that from JPMorgan today, when they said they haven't necessarily seen a significant pullback in consumer spending. Yeah, that's a great point and a great question. So about 80% of what goes on in the United States economy goes on regardless. Just go back and look at 07 to 09 and you'll realize that 80% of what goes on always goes on. It's that 20% of variable GDP that the recession hits, right? So if the economy contracts 4%, it means 20% of the 20% that's variable got hit. And so we feel the pain, right? Because people live a lot in that variable part of their life, not in the fixed part of their life. So that's where the concern is, but from an investor standpoint, a company is worth the net present value of the future income stream and the future cash flows. And 4% less for a year in a 20 year time continuum doesn't really change the net present value of a business very much. And that's where people make all their mistakes. They sell their stocks because of recession. Because they're going to get less 4% less affection from the economy. They don't do that with their spouse. They certainly don't do that with their spouse. Bill, you know, another sector we've been watching really closely is housing. And we got some color on that front from some of these bank earnings in terms of where mortgage rates are right now. Home lending originations, at least with Wells Fargo, down nearly 60% in year over year at JPM. That was down 71%. How much worse do you think things are going to get on that front? Well, they've lost all the stupid stuff. You know, the people buying four houses and flipping, you know, all that stuff is going away, all the fluff. And I think Stuart Miller, the head of Lenard, said at best two weeks ago on his earnings call, he says, we're going to manage our way through this difficulty the next 12 months so that we come out on the other side with dramatically larger market share. We own the largest home builders because over the next 10 years, there's 92 million millennials. They were seven years slower than other age groups getting started buying houses and they will buy houses the next 10 years. And that happened in the 70s with high inflation rates. We had the biggest home building boom of the last 60 years in the 1970s with sky high mortgage rates. So that sounds like you're not so cynical moving forward. I mean, you're not, you're not a cynical some others who've said that, you know, these higher rates are really going to accelerate some of the losses we've seen on that side. No, you're talking to a guy whose first mortgage was 13.5% in 1983 on a state buydown. We were anxious to get it because we had one child one on the way. That's why we like you, Bill. Some context there, right? Historical context. Important. Let's talk a bit strategy right now. You sort of alluded to some of these names that you think would be good buys right now. Obviously, you know, sort of the traditional thinking has been that with these big banks, especially they could benefit on the back of higher rates. There's the macro story sort of weighing on that as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,124,2022-10-14 18:39:40
3358," Obviously, you know, sort of the traditional thinking has been that with these big banks, especially, they could benefit on the back of higher rates. There's the macro story sort of weighing on that as well. Which one of these names do you think is best positioned to write out some of the choppiness we're likely to see over the next several months? Well, we have owned Bank American JP Morgan since 2012. And if you think people are skeptical of them now, you should go back and relive 2012, right? I mean, people didn't know whether they were going to survive. Remember we had the C-car meetings and the Fed would give them a hard time and wouldn't let them buy back their stock when it was cheap and wouldn't let them pay dividends and so forth. So this tribulation compared to that tribulation is peanuts for these folks. They're way overcapitalized. They're super strong. So we like Bank American JP Morgan. They are the largest deposit banks to millennials because they have the best mobile banking. And now they're going to get to have them as people that borrow money for necessity purposes. And by the way, that's a powerfully positive influence in the economy. And then we love American Express because they're the favorite credit card of the millennials who, despite the fact they're getting married in record numbers this year and going to have kids in X-5 years, will still drag those little kids all over the place on exotic travel with the travel points they get on our American Express card. And I hear you're chuckling. You're probably a customer. Just laughing at the context here. Well, we love to have you on the show. We really appreciate your time today. Bill Smith, Speed Capital Management, CIO. Thank you. Well, retail sales remaining unchanged in September or missing. Economist forecast of a 0.2% rise to help break down the report.

And so keep in mind that retail sales also, they are not adjusted for inflation. And remember that retail sales include many categories like groceries, a like vehicles, furniture, etc. But two interesting points from this report. First of all, excluding gasoline and autos, retail sales grew by 0.3%. And also what's interesting is the weakness in some of these categories that we've seen. So electronics fell, furniture fell, also auto sales. Those came in weak. So these are some big ticket items. And you could say that, for example, with electronics, well, a lot of people during the pandemic were buying electronics. And now they're using services more and going out more so they don't need more of that. A furniture, you know, that this housing market is slowing down. So you would see a slowdown in furniture sales as well. And auto sales, well, auto prices have gone up too much. And so perhaps this means the consumer is really pulling back. Another big story we're watching and not in the US across the pond here. UK Chancellor, quasi-quarting, ousted by Prime Minister Liz Trost just 38 days after taking that role. Obviously, this on the back of that initial proposal on the tax cuts, which, you know, I think by all accounts was quite disastrous in the rollout. But what can you more can you tell us about the market reaction that we've seen on the back of this? Yeah. So we did see the pound falling. We saw a bond yields being volatile. The 30-year guilt of 11 basis points, the 10-year guilt of six basis points. Prime Minister Trost is saying that the U-turn for this corporate tax cut basically that this is going to reassure the markets. Because we know what the markets did when these tax cuts were announced. And she said parts of the mini budget just went too far. This is to reassure those markets that were going wild. I think it's also to state the bond market as well. Yeah. Put one too far kind of putting it mildly when you look at the market reaction on the back of that. That's certainly a story we'll continue to watch. And that's thanks for that. Thank you. Well, deal making in the grocery space, leading to some big stock moves, shares of Kroger and Albertsons. Both moving to the downside here. After the second largest grocery agreed to buy Albertsons, the deal's valued at $24.6 billion with Kroger buying shares of Albertsons at a 16% premium to its closing price Thursday. The boards of both firms unanimously signed off on the deal. It still needs approval from regulators. And you see both of those stocks taking a hit today. Kroger down about 3.5% Albertsons down nearly 7%. Coming up, bearing the lead, oil supply concerns dominate after OPEC plus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,125,2022-10-14 18:44:06
3359," A hit today, Krugger, down about 3.5% Alpertzens down nearly 7%. Coming up, bearing the lead, oil supply concerns dominate after OPEC plus cuts, but isn't it demand we should be watching a signs point to recessionary cliff edge to talk energy on the other side? squaredHyun from 7.0S Or the follow-up from the OPEC Plus decision to slash supplies it can be used to present a Biden has suggested a review of the relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is of course a long time Washington ally. The move by the oil producing group stands in direct conflict with Biden's goal of ensuring lower prices for US consumers. And this coming just weeks before the all important midterms here. The US says the Saudis presented no market basis for the cuts. Let's get to Regina May or KPMG's global head of clients and markets. Regina gets a talk to you today. Let's start on that comment that we got from President Biden saying there's no market basis. And yet you look at where oil is trading right now. We're right back below the levels we were at when that OPEC Plus cuts decision was first made. So I mean what does that suggest in terms of where the real fears are at the end of the day? Is it about a potential global recession? And a significant pull back into demand? Well I think the market reacted to the headline of the figure of two million barrel per day cut when the reality is that OPEC is producing three and a half million barrels per day lower than their stated production photos. So I saw it more as just a realization and acknowledgement of what's actually happening on the ground. The one thing that was important was the Saudis are starting to signal that they don't have their capacity. But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw in the summer. Now the price is coming back down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,126,2022-10-14 18:48:59
3360," But I think we understand more of the supply side constraints because that's what we've been living with for the last few months and some of the peak pricing that we saw in the summer. Now the price is coming back down to earth because I think, as you mentioned before the break, the demand side pressures are where there's a lot of uncertainty. China still not come back fully online. There's lots of concerns now about what COVID could do over the winter. We're worried about a recession. I think that's brought the price back down. We saw a nearly 20% jump in WTI just in the last two weeks and I think it's coming back down to a more realistic price projection. Specifically on the supply side, we had so many oil analysts come out on the back of that OPEC plus decision saying essentially look despite this announcement of 2 million barrels caught a day. At the end of the day, most of these OPEC members do not meet their quotas. What's the realistic number we should be looking at in terms of how much comes offline as a result of this decision? I think the real number that I was looking at is about 800,000 barrels per day because I just looked at what the reductions were from Saudi, Kuwait and the UAE. Those are parts of the world that do have spirk capacity. When I visit the region, you hear different things from the different executives. That was what the real cut was. The EIA is forecasting that the US is going to exceed 2019 production into 2023. I think the world is starting to get a little more comfortable that we have the supply that we need, especially if we face into a reduced demand environment. If we see a really severe winter and we don't see the recession that folks are expecting and we see demand continue to spike, then we're going to see a lot of upward pressure on price. Let's talk about where those prices could move. You pointed to some demand concerns there, especially coming out of China. We're all watching to see what kind of messaging comes from this party congress over in China from President Xi specifically on the economy. You said we're still talking about a tight supply here. When you say upward pressure, how much more upside do you see going into the winter? I'm worried a lot about a potential big spike in the winter. If we have a really, really cold winter, that's where I think we could see prices back close to 100, maybe even in triple digits. But I'm hedging against that. I really think the prices are closer to where they should be. I've said WTI and Brent should be in the 80s. That was what OPEC plus was trying to do is shore the price back up because they saw the market potentially overreacting to some of the demand concerns and not paying enough attention to the supply. So I think that's in part what drove their 2 million barrel per day headline cut, which is just making transparent to the rest of the world what was actually going on. And Regina, I know you can't speak to specifically the political environment in all of this, but it does feel like there are increasing lines being drawn geopolitically when you think about what happened between Saudi Arabia, Slash, Russia, OPEC and the US. And you've got the Western European countries in pushing their sanctions as well against Russia. I mean, at the end of all of this, wherever that end may be, how is the oil market going to look? I mean, how fragmented do you think things could get? I think I keep the same that has always surprised me is there's four fundamentals of how countries and markets need to manage energy. And that first and foremost is energy security. Second is affordability. Third is reliability. Fourth is sustainability. No doubt the climate agenda is huge and we are facing a climate crisis, but the world was focusing more on number four. There's almost like a Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you don't have the energy that you need and it's not affordable and it's not reliable, then governments and policymakers need to get very heavily involved. And so that's how I would characterize what we're seeing today is the realization your previous gifts talked about the 70s. I'm a child of the 70s. I remember long gas lines during oil embargoes. We're relearning the lessons from decades ago. And hopefully we do a better time this time around. Yeah, a lot of people kind of drawing parallels looking back in time and history right now with so much going on at KPMG's global head of clients and markets, Regina mayor. Good to have you on today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,127,2022-10-14 18:52:29
3361," I'll be looking back in time in history right now with so much going on. KPMG's global head of clients and markets, Regina Mayer. Good to have you on today. Well coming up the final frontier, Elon Musk, Warren, SpaceX can't help Ukraine indefinitely. So the question here, could the crucial Starling terminals be pulled? And if they stay, who pays? We'll get into that on the other side. Well, SpaceX is saying it can no longer pay for critical satellite services in Ukraine. And it's asking the Pentagon to pick up the tab. That's according to reporting at a CNN. Musk appears to have confirmed the report in a tweet, writing in part. Strange that nothing was leaked about our competitors and space launch and communications, Lockheed and Boeing, who get over $60 billion. Now the same CNN report, reference SpaceX figure shared with the Pentagon. Take a look at this. 85% of the 20,000 Starling terminals in Ukraine were paid for or partially paid for by countries like the U.S. Poland or other entities, who also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity. Now SpaceX says that costs about $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. Musk has said there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine to break it all down. Let's bring in Prague, it's supermanian. And the reason we're talking about this, some context here, is that earlier this year, Elon Musk sort of seemed to apply that we're doing this good thing, where we're going to be donating Starling that this was all being paid for by SpaceX. It's not necessarily the case in this story at a CNN really does point to the cost of operating it, who's funding the bill, and what this means ultimately for the future, because Ukraine has really come to rely on this for connectivity. And what I understand is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,128,2022-10-14 18:56:40
3362," to the cost of operating it, who's funding the bill, and what this means ultimately for the future because Ukraine has really come to rely on this for connectivity. From what I understand, it's a huge part of their operations against Russia. They need this connectivity. When we first heard about Musk donating the Starlink service, we thought this was free. They were actually out of their pocket, sending them the actual terminals and then paying for the service. But it turns out, it looks at 85% is inputted by the US and actually pulling paying a lot for those terminals. So a little surprise there. Also the odd timing, it's like Musk also kind of noting the fact that after he put out that supposed controversial peace plan and then the Ukrainians were... Queen Russia and Ukraine, which seemed to suggest that he was more in line with the Russian thinking. Exactly, not so much the Ukrainian side and then Ukrainians were upset about that and then all of a sudden, oh, by the way, you get to pay for this. According to the CNN obtained report letter that they sent to the defense department. So, I guess at odd timing here, it's sort of a strange sort of... I really don't understand why Musk would even put out this sort of image that he's actually donating this stuff in actual actuality was not. And it's not a cheap service. Like, SpaceX is not a charitable organization. It is a company that's trying to be profitable and it's cost a lot of money. So I understand that part. But guess what, SpaceX worth 120 billion valuation. Musk worth around 200 billion personally. So I think it's hard for people to sort of round out the, hey, you need to get paid for the service when the actually you guys are actually worth. I've got a lot of money. Neil and Musk obviously never want to stay silent especially on Twitter when he's been getting a lot of pushbacks since that report came out from CNN last night. What have we even hearing from him today? Well, we saw it today. I mentioned that tweet from late last night about how, hey, the LEO connectivity is a very expensive business. It's not cheap. We are digging out of our own pockets to do this. So don't expect us to pay for this going forward. We're talking about 120 million through the end of the year. And then I think 300 to 400 million through next year. So it is not cheap. SpaceX is trying to get their model off the ground. So I totally understand that. So that's what he's saying right now. But I think you sort of caught in the cross here. Is it do you support Russia or Ukraine? And why are you actually kind of debating this right now? In the grand scheme of things, now that we kind of know that the numbers in terms of, you know, what the connectivity, the service itself is going to cost, how significant is Starlink to the future of SpaceX? Because this is something that, you know, it's been getting a lot of attention because this is a real use case in Ukraine. They have to your point really come to rely on this service. But in the grand scheme of things for SpaceX, how big is Starlink? I believe it's, it was supposed to be a big component of their profitability. It's a service that they can offer. Not only is it 4,500 for that high in terminal service, but also it's 50 bucks a month for families and other people to use that in places like India, for instance, like they want to deploy that there. It is a big part of their sort of mission to kind of not only just, you know, send elevators into space with rockets, but also to sort of connect everyone through the world through global satellite internet. So it is a big part of that story and a big part of that profitably component, but I guess right now it's still not fully profitable. Okay, something to watch there. According to Elon Musk. According to Elon Musk, always according to Elon Musk. Pros, thanks so much for that. We're continuing the never ending saga between Elon Musk and Twitter. Core documents and SEAL Thursday reveal that Elon Musk is under federal investigation for actions connected with this $44 billion Twitter acquisition. That's bringing Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan, Alexis, what, how many days ago were we talking about? How well, the deal's probably gonna get closed. And here we are talking about another investigation. What is this specifically a lullaby round? Okay, so it could be investigations plural because of the way that this filing is phrased. Now, why are we learning about this? It's because Twitter is asking for the judge in the Delaware case, the dispute over the acquisition that's currently stayed, the trial is stayed, not the case going forward.

You can see the Dow off just around 337 points Nasdaq moving to the downside off nearly two and a half percent S&P just below a 3600 off nearly 2% today in terms of some of the other broader movements that we're seeing Russell 2000 that small cap index off just over 2%. Let's take a look at the Philly semiconductor index. We know that has been under pressure and we're seeing that a lot of people are looking at the market action. We're seeing that a lot of people are looking at the market action. We're seeing that recently this semi is falling once again today with that index off just over 3%. 10 year yield moving to the upside back above a 4% you could see the 30 year up another 5 basis points.

All right, getting you up to speed now on the shake up in the UK. The British pound falling again as Prime Minister Liz Truss replaces her finance Minister Quasi Quaritan with former health and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt. Truss today also revered the US today also reversing course on another of those proposed cuts on corporations and insisting she will stay on as Prime Minister. The Bank of England has also wrapped up its bond buying program that was in response to settle markets after all the upheaval. Of course, you'll recall the tumultuous three weeks for markets, pensions and the Bank of England itself after Quasi unveiled his mini budget. And that included a raft of unfunded tax cuts that were highly criticised. What a rollercoaster ride it's been in the UK. Alright, let's get you up to speed now on a major acquisition. The second largest grocer for even shopping for even greater markets share. Croger agreed to buy Albertsons at 3410 a share.

3364," Grocer for even shopping for even greater market share. Croger are green to buy Albertsons at 3410 a share. Deal worth 24.6 billion dollars. This merges the second and fourth biggest super market chains. Together now they employ more than 700,000 employees and more than 5,000 stores. Little context though, Walmart still has more than twice the number of US stores and employees. How are the stocks reacting? Croger shares down more than 5% Albertsons and buy the rumor sell the news reaction was way up yesterday. Down with some percent today. Both companies boards though. You dynamically approve this agreement, which will have some regulatory hurdles ahead. But again, let's take into context how much bigger Walmart is by comparison if that matters. And now for more on the markets we turn to Invesco. Global market strategist Brian levitt to break down a wild week in the markets. Brian, yesterday we get the bad inflation print. Market skyrocket today. They fall through the floor. What do you make of the last couple of days when you take it all in context? Yesterday was a bit surprising. I mean, you get a consumer price index report that's worse than expected. You would expect the usual risk off trade to move after that. And then it didn't happen. I mean, it happened briefly. Today makes more sense where you've got rates going up again. So we're pushing up short rates and equities coming under pressure. And in my opinion, that's the trade until we get the proverbial pause from the Fed. I think the market will start to sniff it out before the Fed even announces that pause. But CPI report this week suggested it's still. We're still waiting for it. And so I think today's market action makes more sense than what we saw yesterday. Hey, Brian, what do you think needs to happen in order for the Fed to pause? Well, the good news is we've got inflation expectations that are anchored. So that's good, long term. But you're going to need to see a headline CPI come down pretty consistently. And so it'll start to happen as the year progresses. I mean, yesterday's CPI report wasn't great. So if the market goes up 0.4 for the month, consumer price index. If you can 0.3 every month between now and next year, you're at 3.1% year over year. So that's the moderation. That's what the Fed's looking for. And as it happens, as the reports come in better than expectations, that's when the market is going to start to price in that recovery trade, it'll commence even before the Fed admits that they're going to pause. Hey, Brian, just in terms of that hot inflation that we did get yesterday. I think it did catch some at least on the street by surprise. Anything in that report change your view of the markets over the next month or two. Not really. I mean, we all been hopeful that inflation had been hit. It's had peaked and that's probably right. But it's, you know, it's coming down not as quickly as we would have hoped. It's pretty clear that the goods inflation story is behind us. We see the declining commodity prices. It's the thickness and shelters and rents and the bit wages. And so we know that that's going to be a little bit sickier that takes, you know, higher rates takes time to work through the residential market, but will ultimately do so. You know, so the challenge here is the feds data dependent. I wish they were using more forward looking models, because that is going to take some time. But I think it's pretty clear from all of us to all of us where it's ultimately going. So the messages in your term caution on markets were still in a contraction, were still tightening. But inflation is going to come down. And usually when inflation comes down, markets do very well. And Brian, you mentioned looking ahead, obviously, this is a midterm election. Yeah, I know you've been following some of the historical context between midterms and markets, especially with this last CPI print before the midterms. What is history telling us about what we can expect? Well, what you usually find is your two of a presidential cycle is the worst with regards to returns in year three. It ends up being significantly better. Now you could just say that that's a coincidence. But if you want to set a narrative around it or reason it, it would be that it's just one less uncertainty to weigh on the market. The most likely.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,131,2022-10-14 19:11:23
3365," You just say that that's a coincidence, but if you want to set a narrative around it or reason it, it would be that it's just one less uncertainty to weigh on the market. The most likely outcome here is a divided government. Now, it's above my pay grade to tell you which way the House or the Senate are going to go, but I can watch the polls. And it suggests a divided government, which suggests not a lot gets done. And so when you're fighting inflation, you saw this in the UK. I mean, in the UK's fighting inflation, and you get a budget deal that the market views as inflationary becomes problematic. Armit terms are going to likely lead to not all getting done. So not a lot of fiscal support, which I think the market will embrace. The biggest point I like to make to investors is that markets have gone up under all combinations of government. The economy has largely performed the same, whether it's single-party world Democrats, single-party world Republicans, divided government, politics elections don't matter nearly as much for markets as I think investors believe. Brian, you said you wish the Fed used more of a leading indicator rather than the lagging that they do generally look at. What would give, I think Kathy would, by the way, jumped up and said you got that right. But what are those indicators that you wish the Fed would look at that give them a better picture of the inflation story? Well, you've seen financial conditions tighten. We've seen the dollar strengthen pretty significantly. The yield curve is already inverted. So all of those are suggesting a pretty bad economic outcome, or at least a recession. The other thing is inflation expectations. So typically, when you're in a contraction, you start to ease economic policy. You're in a contraction and we're still tightening because we're afraid that inflation is becoming unhinged, but long-term inflation expectations are somewhere between two and a half and three percent. This is not 1974 where long-term inflation expectations were 10 percent. It's a very, very different environment. It's a unique, pandemic cycle. If I'm the Fed and I've got the bond market, 1, 3, 5, 10 inflation expectations telling me inflation's not a problem, it's going to come down rapidly. Why am I tightening so meaningfully into a contraction? This is the risk of an accident. Tighten a lot. What's the what it means for the economy before we keep doing more, but it doesn't matter what I think it's the Fed's going to do what they're going to do and we know rates are gone higher from here. So Brian, in terms of what you're seeing with the markets, what is it signaling about their expectations for recession? For those who don't believe we're already in one, what the expectations are for next year? Yeah, there's a likelihood that we'll have a recession. The major things point into a strong dollar inverted deal curve. We all get that. The question is, what does that mean for investors? We've already gone down 26, 27 percent peak to drop in the S&P 500. The average in recession times is 31, 32 percent. So we've maybe done a good amount of it, but most of the market downturn has largely been evaluation adjustment due to higher rates. The question is, what type of earnings hit you get in a recession? If you figure somewhere between 10 and 15 percent, that could take you to earnings somewhere around 180, 190. If you're willing to pay a 20 multiple on that, then markets are fair value. If in that recession, inflation stays too elevated, valuations are going to come down and we may need to see somewhat lower levels from here. For the most part, the market does a pretty good job of pricing these things in beforehand. Recession seems to be in the cards, but for longer term investors, if you focus on an peak in inflation and how that comes down over time and what that means for markets, usually a buying opportunity, even if there's near-term drawdowns and volatility to have to contend with. All right. So some vital opportunities to be had there on the cons. Invest go global markets, strategies, bright and levied. Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon. All right.

Here to discuss what this means for the economy and Fed policy moving forward, we want to bring in Austin Kool-Zi. We have Chicago professor and former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors. Mr. Kool-Zi, it's great to see you. Certainly a lot of news happening this week. We got that hotter than expected inflation print 8.2 percent retail sales out this morning. They were flat in September. Just give us your sense of the economy given that new data that we've been getting over the last couple of weeks. Yeah, thanks for having me back. I mean, I think we're in this transition period and it's a transition on multiple dimensions. One, consumers are shifting back to spending on services from spending on physical goods. Two, inflation continues to be hot. You saw core inflation coming in higher than expected, higher than the Fed wanted. And in an environment like that where the real wage is going down, salaries are not rising as fast as prices. You're going to see some slowdown on the consumer spending front. And I wouldn't be surprised if where you really start to the rubber hit the road, see it on consumer spending on durables, automobiles, and housing, the most interest rate sensitive parts. That's a good issue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,133,2022-10-14 19:18:17
3367," that the rubber hit the road, see it on consumers spending on durable, automobiles and housing, the most interest rate sensitive parts. Austin, good to see you. What do you think the likelihood of a recession is? And do you think the Fed will at some point call it a win if they get an inflation number around 3% rather than the ideal target of two? I say recessions absolutely a real possibility. As you know, the main cause of recessions, post-World War II, has been the Fed raising interest rates faster than the economy can handle. What we have to hope and for sure what the Fed is looking for are improvements on the supply side, that all the negative supply shocks that in my opinion drove a lot of the inflation in the US and around the world, that as we get out of the COVID times and maybe if the war doesn't deteriorate in Ukraine, we could start to get some positives on that side. That's how you would avoid recession and have a soft landing. But if not, I think that's absolutely on the table. And I don't think the Fed will, you would, from the public announcements, you don't see much wiggle room in the Fed saying, oh, well, if we get one month of beneficial reports, then we'll declare that our job is over here. I think they will need to see sustained slowing of inflation before they're going to think that it's time to pause. Also, what do you think of the Fed's job so far, just in terms of how much progress they have made up until this point? You know, the Fed's gets criticized from all dimensions and all sides. This has been an extremely difficult period for the Fed to navigate what to do. Not just because you have to figure out is the inflation coming from supply shocks, which raising interest rates doesn't fix or from excess stimulus and excess demand, which interest rates could, you also have this whole added bit that our recession was, look, nothing like a previous recession, the one in COVID, because it was concentrated in services. And this issue of pent up demand for services makes the normal Fed job of we apply the break to counteract how fast the economy's growing. It makes that based on no historical record. There's never been any business cycle that looked like this. So it's very hard to weigh off how many, is everybody going to go to Disneyland for two weeks this year and go out to restaurants every night of the week because they've been locked up in their houses for a year and a half? If so, then the economy might overheat on consumer spending grounds, but that's never happened before. So we really, the Fed doesn't know exactly what to do. When you see two different companies in two different sectors, I'm talking Pepsi here, who said we dramatically increase prices, we saw no demand destruction, Delta Airlines, same thing with airfare is up 43% year over year, no waning demand, record demand. What does it tell you the Fed is going to need to do in order to bring, get cost control as they call it? Well, this is back to the fundamental religious divide of, do you think the inflation and the price increases are coming from supply shocks and cost problems? Or do you think it's coming from excess demand? If you think it's mostly from excess demand, then what the Fed is going to need to do is keep raising rates to try to tamp down demand. But do you think it's supply? If you think that a lot of it's coming from supply, and the fact that you've got inflation rates of 10% in Germany, 9% in the UK, and high inflation all around the world, and there's not a single country on the planet that's below the 2% inflation target, those make you think, whoa, will the Fed be able to do anything other than generate a stagnation? So I think this is really the nugget of where we are and what we're trying to deal with. Awesome. Where does this leave jobs and all this? Because we know the Fed has said that we need to see job losses in order to get inflation under control. That, of course, has been up for debate. Where do you stand on that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,134,2022-10-14 19:22:45
3368," Awesome. Where does this leave jobs and all this? Because we know the Fed has said that we need to see job losses in order to get inflation under control. That, of course, has been up for debate. Where do you stand on that? Well, be careful. The Fed said that they need to see a cooling of the job market. But I think what the Fed is hoping is that they could reduce the number of vacancies without driving up the unemployment rate or putting people out of work. And for a couple of months, at least, they have been able to do that. The job market remains remarkably strong. And if the unemployment rate went from three and a half to four and a half, four and a half unemployment rate is still a very low unemployment rate. There are periods not that long ago where people would be saying four and a half is full employment. So I'm hopeful that the Fed can navigate this with a little good fortune on the supply shark front that they could navigate it without having a dramatic increase in unemployment. If not, if we don't get improvements on the supply side, then we're in the kind of the old fashioned environment where there's just a direct tradeoff. And if you want to get inflation to come down, you've got to administer pain. I'm sure you're always looking at the labor force participation rate, which we can stubbornly be low where it was pre-pandemic. And maybe a million of those people retired and are gone for good. How can the Fed get that labor force participation rate back to where it was? Maybe the million, million and a half back to work? Well, again, be careful. You've seen a dramatic increase from the trough upward in labor force participation. It's trending down to over a 10, 15 year period, partly because you got the baby boom retiring, partly from demographics. And then you've got the two that you got the double whammy of long COVID and people taking care of people with COVID. That's half a million to one and a half million out of the labor force. And then you've had a massive drop in legal immigration into the country. Those two things are longer term, unfortunately, than what we wanted them to be. Hopefully we can get past the long COVID part. But without returning the flow of immigration, I think we're still going to be dealing with this labor shortage type issue for some years to come. Rough road ahead. Austin Gooseby, always great to have you here, sir. Appreciate your time. Great to see you again. All right, coming up, Tesla shares are sliding as we head into the close.

3369," Triple play, the three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got plug, eutannics and Tesla. So plug, my pick plug power, tick a PLUG at the stock in the hydrogen and fuel cell maker under pressure today. As you can see, they're down about 5.5%. Now that's after warning, full year 2022 revenue would be 5% to 10% lower than the expected 900 million to 925 million that they laid out in their August call with investors. That's now dropping to between 821 and 867 million. Now this is because of timing and broader supply chain problems. And this also means that completion of some of its larger projects is also being delayed from 2022 to 2023. Now the company did say demand for the fuel cell applications and electricalizer business does remain robust. They also expect an accelerated path to profitability and positive cash flows. The stock has had some wild swings though a year to date. It's down more than 30%, but big banks are still bullish on the long term future of hydrogen. We saw Goldman Sachs predicting that hydrogen generation will eventually become a $1 trillion per year market. City Group also bullish on hydrogen fuel cells. And that's despite some of these full starts for the industry. But they see more impetus from policymakers, especially as we consider the energy crisis in Europe really putting some of these alternatives into the forefront. Yeah, Michelle. I think we can sum up what's happening with this stock today, similar to what we've seen from other companies who have guided lower, didn't meet Wall Street expectations or simply is not any room for that in terms of the market today. We're seeing that reflected in the stock price day, which shares off just around 5.5%. Ahead of today's drop, the stock had actually been doing relatively okay for the past three months. It was up 8% over the past three months through yesterday's closing price. That of course, better than the S&P's, a 3% slip during that same time. So obviously a huge headwind here for club power at least in the immediate term as a company does work out some of those supply issues that you were just talking about. All right, my play today is Nutanix. Now the cloud computing company shares a surging. I'm reports that it's exploring a possible sale after getting some takeover interest now. Nutanix is expected to target a private equity and industry players. This is all according to report from the Wall Street Journal. But this deal is far from done. We know Nutanix's market value is currently just around 5 billion. The potential buyer would likely have to pay a very attractive premium. Dave, you're looking at shares surging here. So we could get some M&A news maybe pretty soon when it comes to this player. We don't get much though in this environment. In fact, Q3 saw the worst quarter in the prior five years. It just over $500 billion of M&A activity. And there was only one quarter that was even close to that. That was Q2 2020. What happened then? Of course, the pandemic just stopped the economy and it's track. So not a real good environment for such activity. We shall see. My play is Tesla shares of Elon, ZVMaker slumping to end this week. Though it's our Goldman Sachs reiterate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,136,2022-10-14 19:31:56
3370," We shall see. My play is Tesla shares of Elon's EV maker slumping to end this week. A week though, that saw Goldman Sachs reiterate a buy rating with a $305 price target, implying 45 percent upside. We can which ARK Invest Kathy would told Yahoo Finance Tesla is a quote solution to the economy's problem. The bad news, well, it's probably the man more than the company. A Twitter filing saying, a court filing Thursday that Elon Musk is being invested by federal authorities over his conduct in the $44 billion takeover deal for the social media giant. And I'm searching for more bad news. I figured that couldn't be enough to justify 7 percent down. Analyst at Wells Fargo have lowered their price target from 280 to 230 citing waning demand for the EV. So that probably has a bigger factor on this 7 percent drop. Down 47 percent. It's been a rough year to date. That appears to be what is pushing a tough day for Tesla, Richelle. And we are seeing some other EVs falling as well. We heard from Morgan Stanley there concern that what they what they might hear from China at the Communist Party meeting might mean some of this trade rhetoric might make it a bit more difficult for the EV space. And China obviously the biggest auto market in the world. It's not really what you want to hear. If you're an EV maker and trying to either get your things manufactured there or sold there as well. Yeah. Yeah. One of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 today. Well, coming up next as a Biden administration, it was a chip crackdown on China.

3371," Chinese President Xi Jinping on the cusp of what some are calling his imperial moment. In a break from their prior two-term limit, Xi about to be given a third five-year term as Communist Party leader at the end of the major party Congress that opens Sunday. What does that mean for China? I want, and of course, for U.S.-China relations, Max Balkus, the former U.S. ambassador to China and was a Montana senator for more than 35 years. Mr. Ambassador, great to see you. Appreciate you coming on. Let's start with the latter. Headline of the Wall Street Journal reads, a China prepared for conflict with the United States. What does Xi's extended rule mean for the U.S.? I think he's going to consolidate power. We'll see that after the 20th Party Congress. Xi is very proud. He tends to be more of a Maoist than following a Deng Xiaoping who opened up China. He's very proud of China's tradition and, of course, China's rightful place in history, after all, China began thousands of years ago. He wants China to be a co-equal global power with the United States. I don't think he wants to control the United States. He wants to be a co-equal power. He wants to be respected. I think that's just been goal. So Ambassador, as we look at what's on the agenda for this conference, obviously, you have the zero-covid policy. A lot of people wondering if that's going to get lifted. And also what this is going to mean for economic growth and the strategy in China. Where are expectations for what we're going to hear? I don't think we'll see much change in zero-covid. It's hard for Xi Jinping to change. Xi's going to want to save face. It's a policy that's right thing to do, frankly, they're much bigger country than we population four times ours. Vaccines not nearly as good as ours. He doesn't have a lot of choice. Zero-covid is a, you know, the pursuit. But it's a big problem for the economy, clearly. It's disrupted supply change. It's caused the economy to suffer significantly, but he's not going to change it for a while, anyway. We're going to try to probably spend a little bit more money, showing up the basic industries in the country, instruct banks to loan a little bit more. He sees this as a major confrontation with the United States. That is when he looks at actions we take the United States, the Chip Reduction Act, and more recently, the restrictions on export controls, they're serious. They're very serious. And, frankly, if you look at the rhetoric both sides, they're pretty much similar. Each wants to compete the other, whatever competition means. We're really evolving into a Cold War, despite words to the country by the United States and China.<|zh|><|translate|><|zh|><|translate|><|zh|><|translate|><|zh|><|translate|> In fact, if you look at the rhetoric both sides, they're pretty much similar.

3372," the local economy, but exports, they're doing pretty well, but they know that they're going to prosper long when they have to focus much more on the domestic economy. They'll do what they can, in addition, they're going to really double down on chip production. I can't overefacise the importance of the recent Biden-Notspin on export controls. That's a big shot across China's, you know, Huawei's bad enough. This is much worse in their view. So the economy will suffer, but they're sure going to look and don't forget China thinks in the longer term. And I was serving in China over and over again. I was impressed with how much they think in the long term and also how proud they are and how working they are. I don't overstate it, but they are very proud working people. And we Americans, frankly, don't know enough about China. We don't spend much time over there. We don't know China. And probably that's due to quarantine restrictions that we can't go over. But if more Americans were able to spend more time in China, I think we have a little more realistic view of what's happening. Interesting. What do you think she's extended rule third term means for the likelihood of a confrontation with Taiwan? And how do you believe the United States would respond? Well, those are two different questions. Taiwan is the redest of red lines for China. It's existential. It's non-negotiable. It was once part of China. The Japanese took it over. Shanghai Shack took the nationalist over to Taiwan. It's part of China and their view. There's no question about it. They point out to our one China policy. Say, hey, you Americans, you'd agree there's one China policy. And I think she, Jim Bing, is to try to play the long game. It'd be a slimy slicing. That's very Chinese. And I was really sure learned that a little still a bit here. Step at a time. Maybe a little bit across the Taiwan straits, a little bit here. They're slowly, slowly, slowly. They wake up one day. It's like the frog in the pot of water. It's just all in macro. They're really in charge. Just like they did in the South China Sea, dumping sand on submerged reefs and pretty soon we get islands. They're slowly, slowly, slowly. That's their M.O. They needn't be able to afford to do that, but that's their M.O. They really feel, they don't believe the United States words. When the United States says, we support a one China policy. That's just words. You don't mean that. They look at Biden statements. Biden's four times. It said something that's much stronger than that. And US politicians, in the passage of the Taiwan policy act, really push more and more against that tripwire, which means that China is going to cite enough so enough. We're playing a very dangerous game in Taiwan, in my view. We should continue our policy of strategic ambiguity, but don't support Taiwan too much. We're going to get to the point where it's going to cause a huge problem with China. China is certainly playing a long game. It's got a hundred-year plan. It's certainly a very different game they're playing indeed. A big thank you to former United States ambassador to China Max Balcos. Thank you so much for joining us. Welcome.

3373,". this is the city's city. The quarter bank earnings are under way. JPMorgan city Wells Fargo all beating the streets expectations. Shares moving higher here. As you can see, Morgan Stanley on their other hand is the city's city. The city's city and Kenley on his CFRA research director of research. Ken is great to see you. Taking a look at these results JPMorgan revenue of 10% here. Morgan Stanley missing expectations. Profit of nearly 30% city profit dropping. 25% although better than what the street was looking for. It seems like Wall Street was looking for a lot of things that the US economy is resilient. The consumer is healthy. Business loans are going on. Of course, investment banking activity has really no-stied from last year. The stocks were a lot this morning, but they have really faded this afternoon because the real issue is that they have a lot of things that they have to back performance. Some further weakening of the consumer. It hasn't happened yet in terms of delinquencies or bad loans. But the banks are adding some reserves. Again, today's results is a good picture of what happened from July to September. The banks are going to be going down to 50 basis points and then 25. So, rates do matter. It will create some demand destruction. Unfortunately. So, Ken, within the banking industry, what do you credit JPMorgan doing so much better than some of these other banks? Well, Wall Street also did well. And the real thing is that when you have rising rates, it drives higher net interest income, widening spreads, you can just sit and sit and sit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,141,2022-10-14 19:54:14
3374," The real edge of the beauty of banks is that when you have rising rates, it drives higher net interest income, widen spreads, you can just sit back and so long as there's a loan activity, you're going to show higher net revenue. Unfortunately, that probably will not be the picture in 2023 because loan activity is going to subside for both consumer and commercial and industrial loans. So that really is what was expected. We did get that fourth quarter probably will be a decent quarter, but again, every time you raise rates, it's really squeezing the U.S. economy more than before, and that's what the Fed has to do to get inflation under control. Can one thing that you mentioned in your note that stuck out to me was JP Morgan's head count, and actually went up 9%. We haven't really seen the reduction in head counts at the bank yet. As you talk about this uncertainty over the next several months, potentially a potential downturn here, what do you think that head count will likely look like? Do you think we're going to start seeing some reduction? Well, it's a great issue, and JP Morgan, 9% increase in global head count. A lot of that is investing in technology, software, taking on the disruptors of Fintech, maybe something from blockchain. But again, you get these senior management around the table in November. There's probably going to be some tactical cutbacks in investment banking, because the book's not going to be there in the fourth quarter, and the pipeline, even if you say it's there, it's not likely that we're going to see some V-shaped rebound in the first quarter of next year. I've been covering the capital markets for a long time, and this unfortunately is going to be a stretch, where it's just going to be tough. And Ken, as we're looking at shares of Morgan Stanley under pressure today, you still have a buy opinion on it, and you have a price target of $90. What is the base case there? Yeah, the base case. So we downgraded Goldman Sachs a month ago from strong by the whole. We kept Morgan Stanley as a buy, and our view was it was trading at a discount to names like BlackRock and Schwab. They're the leading and wealth management that got a high recurring revenue from wealth, but they still have an investment banking business. So it's not our best buy rating, but we're going to state the course. They also have the most dry powder for buybacks, and they had the most room from the Fed stress test last June. So I like what James Gorman and Morgan Stanley are doing, but I'm fighting uphill because the investment banking equity debt underwriting is not likely to be much better in the fourth quarter. MNA probably will take up a debt. Well, so let me be keeping in mind that thank you for joining us with your insights. Ken, Leon, CFI research director of research. Have a good weekend. Michelle, let's take a look at the strong dollar. You've heard it mentioned numerous times. It's a head one for the economy. It's a big challenge facing corporate America. And here is why the strong greenback, while it gives Americans more purchasing power overseas, it also means that US exports are more expensive for foreign citizens. Now the company's most at risk are those dependent on international sales that can take a chunk out of their bottom lines. Money made overseas when it was when it's translated back into dollars, lessons of value given at the current exchange rates. Now it gives foreign competitors an edge here making it more difficult for US companies to remain competitive with those local alternatives. Now Microsoft and Nike, IBM, Deer, AdV, Netflix, just some of the companies to recently warn of the risks that the strong dollar poses to their business. And we know that it's going to be a very common theme on earnings calls this quarter. Since roughly get this 40% of S&P company sales are actually generated abroad. Now to put this in perspective, let's take a look at the dollars jump. Here we were at the beginning of the year below 90. You can see the jump up of nearly 17 and a half percent. Now we're trading right above 113 just off the highest level that we were at in about 20 years. Now in the past year, let's take a look at the dollar versus the euro. And as we pull up this chart on a one year basis, you can see a 19% jump in terms of the strength of the dollar.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,141,2022-10-14 19:54:51
3375," Last year, let's take a look at the dollar versus the Euro. And as we pull up this chart on a one-year basis, you can see a 19% jump in terms of the strength that did the dollar versus the Euro. And taking a look at the British pound, you can see it up just around 22%. The dollars gained in the third quarter was actually the biggest quarterly jump that we've seen since 2016. Bank of America expects the dollar strength to shade 5% to 6% off earnings for S&P companies. In the third quarter, technology and materials, those are the two sectors that they say are most at risk. All right, well, coming up, a hearing and disgrace to get their nose at founder, Elizabeth Holmes, big to get a new trial is about to begin. We've got those details for you next. zur temporale Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Now be sure to tune in to Yahoo Finance's All Market Summit on Monday, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. Power out CEO Bob Bakish and Film and TV producer Jerry Brockheimer, that just two of the many industry leaders who you'll be hearing from. You won't want to miss it. Just a few minutes, hearing is scheduled to begin. The ongoing legal saga surrounding Theronos founder Elizabeth Holmes. Yahoo Finance is Alexis Keenan here. This is hearing is part of Holmes bid for a new trial. What's ahead? Okay. So today is a hearing that got moved up. It's at 4 p.m. It's just about to start. And it's a set of the document requests that Holmes has made against Adam Rosendor for as a former laboratory director for Theronos and testified for the prosecution at her trial. She wants some documents because she's got another hearing coming up on Monday that's a big deal and that's her motion for a new trial. She wants to toss out that old conviction for counts of criminal fraud. She's facing 20 plus years in prison on each of the counts that she was convicted on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,142,2022-10-14 19:58:15
3376," Well, and that's her motion for a new trial. She wants to toss out that old conviction for counts of criminal fraud. She's facing 20 plus years in prison on each of the counts that she was convicted on. So what she wants to do on Monday has everything to do with what's going to happen in a little bit here today. But big deal is Monday. She wants a new trial and she wants the judge to say, we're going to have a redo. And that basis that she's making for that redo, she says that Rose Endorf visited her partner, Billy Evans, unannounced after the trial and sort of wanted to apologize for his testimony. And according to Evans, according to Holmes, partner, that Rose Endorf said that the government made his testimony about conditions at Therno sound worse than they actually were. So what we're going to hear is there's judges going to ask, did you testify truthfully at him, Rose Endorf, or did you not? But look, he's facing perjury if he goes ahead and says, I testified untruthfully. Right. So you're leaning in which direction here? So this is a really big bar to reach for any criminal defendant who's already been convicted to get a new trial is a tough road. So it's not looking like chances are so good for Holmes. But look, we have to listen to what the evidence brings. We have to see if he somehow comes in and recants any of his testimony in any little sliver. I didn't want to put my finger on the scale, it had a feeling that's where he really was. Yeah, your feeling was right. Alexis Keenan, good to see you. Thank you. All right, coming up, we're just counting down to the closing bell on Wall Street. Stick with us here on Yahoo Finance Log. Here's a wedding showcase. We're just a few minutes away from the closing bell for the week for that. Let's bring in Yahoo! Finances and there's for it to break down the market action. Hey Anis. Hey Richel, and it looks like we're going to close near the lows of the session. This was a big week. We had the CPI print earlier this week. We had retail sales today, also bank earnings. The down right now down 1.3% the NASDAQ down more than 3% the biggest loser out of the major averages. And the S&P 500 down 2.4% for the last five days the S&P is going to end in negative territory. The NASDAQ also ending in negative territory. Looking at the sector's consumer discretionary is the biggest laggard today. It's also the biggest laggard for the week as I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,143,2022-10-14 20:01:57
3377," Hasdak also ending in negative territory. Looking at the sector's consumer discretionary is the biggest laggard today. It's also the biggest laggard for the week as I pull up the five-day chart here followed by technology. And inside consumer discretionary is Amazon in Tesla. Take a look today at the charts for today. Amazon down 5%, Tesla down more than 7% set to close. About 50% below its November closing high. We've also got Apple that's down more than 3%. A lot of red is what we're seeing on the screen on the NASDAQ 100. And over on the Dow, we only have Verizon that's barely in the green, JP Morgan also in the green. In fact, I'm going to pull up the bank stocks here. And you can see a mixed picture. Here's a closing bell for today. And that wraps up a wild week here for the markets. Again, at least for the day, all three of the major averages ending in the red. You can see right there on your screen right around the lows of the day, Dow off 390, 2 points. S&P off just over 2% than NASDAQ. Look at that. The worst performer of the three off just over 3%, all 11 of the S&P sectors closing in the red today. Big of losses. Consumer discretionary, energy and material. All right. Well, let's bring in Melissa Brown, contigo managing director of applied research. And we also have Sylvia Jablonski, Defiance ETFs, CEO and CIOs. Sylvia, let me start with you just in terms of the wild action that we saw this week. It's back and forth. You want to look any further than yesterday's action. After we got that hot inflation print, initially we sold off and then the start and the markets actually spiked. What do you make of the action that we saw? I should agree to see you. I think that this is all sort of par for the course in terms of what we're seeing in the markets. So there's just too much uncertainty right now. So this range ground volatility, whether it's quick pullbacks that feel pretty meaningful and impactful or quick pops that feel pretty meaningful and impactful, I think that the market just doesn't have any kind of steady footing here. And really it's the same old story. We have all three indices in bear market territory. Inflation is sticking around a little bit longer than we would have liked it to. And that means that the Fed and us waiting to hear the news of every great hike is going to stick around longer than we wanted to. And I think that until we sort of get some confidence that the Fed is either going to pause for some period of time or that we see inflation trending downward for a series of reads. I think that we'll kind of see this range ground volatility for the next few months. Yeah, of course, to hold your breath for a pause at this moment. Melissa, you say investors are likely to react strongly to bad news, potentially ignore downplay good news. How in the world than to explain yesterday at S&P snaps a six day losing streak on the heels of a bad CPI print? It is a difficult move to explain. I think we were looking at not relatively low trading volume. And I think it's just that investors, they're getting sick of being negative. They're getting sick of being bearish. And so perhaps yesterday they just decided to say, okay, when market's down a lot already, let's come in. But then today they got punished for that. So tomorrow, Monday, will that happen again? It's hard to say, but with that negative sentiment, again, I would expect that bad news to lead to much bigger downturns. Then good news will lead to downturns. So in Sylvia, in terms of the outlook, that obviously the Fed is not going to be taking its foot off the pedal any time soon. When do you see the opportunities in this sort of environment knowing that volatility is going to persist until we get the Fed to pivot at some point? Yeah, I think it's important to think about which investor we're kind of talking to and what his or her strategy is. So if you're a longer term investor, and I'm going to say three years is sort of the bottom line there, and you plan to hold even beyond that, then a consistent strategy of dollar cost averaging into your favorite quality stocks that have gone from 22 to 15 multiples.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,144,2022-10-14 20:06:20
3378," into your favorite quality stocks that have gone from 22 to 15 multiples, but probably it's a wire span than that and are down to the tune of 20 to 50 percent. Maybe even a wider span of that. I mean, this is a great opportunity for that. Could the market move on you in reverse another 5 percent? It could, but over the long run, I don't think it's going to matter because we've all been talking about this for quite some time, but since the 1950s, kind of a year out after all of this mass, you tend to see those double digit returns. So long term dollar cost averaging, great opportunity for that. In a short term, though, I think you have to be positioned in a different way. I think it's, you know, if we're talking about getting through to year end, you're probably better off holding, you know, some of the biotech and healthcare names, some of the names that are holding up, you know, Merck is one of the few stocks that has double digit returns this year. They pay a nice dividend, United Healthcare, you know, some of these names are not really impacted by recession, the aging population is continuing to increase. So there's just a good story there in terms of just, you know, safety and overall diversification. And if you're like a super short term trader, I mean, there are bare funds out there, you know, you can kind of short the blockchain crypto ecosystem, you can kind of, you know, short some of the tech and some I conduct your names in a short term. But that's sort of, I would say for a buyer or an investor that's a little more on the professional side. So long term dollar cost average is your quality companies, you know, your Apple Amazon Google's semi conductors, you know, the 5G trade things like that that'll play out over time. And the short term may be sick to defensive names like, like the healthcare names or the alternative energy space too is a good one hydrogen solar things like that. Well, so what do you make of earnings season so far because we certainly have started to get the ball rolling here. We had a number of banks report this morning Pepsi earlier this week, actually much better than what the street had been anticipating. Is this a sign that maybe earnings season isn't going to be as bad as bad as we had initially feared? Well, I don't think you can use, you know, one or two good earnings reports as a sign for what's going to happen for the entire quarter. But it certainly is better to start off the quarter with better news than it is if, you know, we were already in the hole because of some really bad earnings reports. You know, the impact of inflation, you know, you were talking about the dollar before, but, you know, we also have the impact of inflation on both the top line and profit margins that I think we're going to get a lot more clarity on what that impact is over the next couple of weeks. But certainly it's hard to imagine we're going to see a positive impact from inflation across the board. And Sylvia, to touch on the same thing on earnings, anything you learn today from the earnings, the big banks, or that you expect to learn next week when we get a glimpse at Goldman and Bank of America. Yeah, I mean, I would agree with those previous comments, you know, a couple of good reports that does not make a good earnings season just yet. It's a great start. What I would say is that I took some solace in kind of, you know, digging into the conversations behind the earnings releases today and one saying that kind of feels good in terms of worrying about, you know, will we have a deep recession? You know, we may have a recession, we may have a light recession, but when you think about the banks, you know, it's clear that they are, you know, well capitalized that, that, you know, you're not in that 2008 financial crisis sort of state of the world and companies like Pepsi, you know, even CarMax and Micron, like some of the companies that have, you know, guided lower come out with, with poor forecast, they still have great balance sheet. They still have, you know, decent revenues. They're, they're falling, but they're decent. You know, so, so I think what I take from this is that, you know, perhaps the bottom of the market comes before the economy bottoms out, but I don't think that the economy is going to have, you know, kind of like that full on recession that a lot of people are worrying about just because the company's sort of the major corporations, bleach of companies are looking a little bit too good for that to happen. All right, great stuff. We'll have to leave it there. Melissa and Sylvie have a wonderful weekend. Appreciate the time. Coming up, President Biden says there will be consequences for Saudi Arabia following OPEC plus a decision to cut oil production. Find out why the Saudis probably don't care after the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,145,2022-10-14 20:10:58
3379," This Saudi's probably don't care after the break. The US and Saudi Arabia trading accusations over oil supply cuts, the US now claiming Saudi Arabia pushed other OPEC plus nations to vote to cut oil production last week. Look at the next-day epaulure, someone's gone to the US and the Iran Central Conference and said they've been outlining the dramatic parties of Standards on the transitions would much worse. United States of favor here and there being pretty overt around it about it. So let's recall President Biden did make a pilgrimage, if you will, to Saudi Arabia over this summer. This is after he called the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a pariah for orchestrating the murder of Jamal Qashoggi four years ago. So Biden basically went over to make amends and we know he did that because he wanted Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to get prices down and help with the economic war against Russia. So Saudi clearly has been behind this agreement by the OPEC plus nations, which includes Russia, by the way, to actually cut production rather than increase production. So now Biden says there will be consequences for this. The Saudi foreign ministry, this was unusual. They actually released a statement a couple days ago saying we're pushing back against these allegations that were trying to help Russia out. These were purely for economic reasons that we want to cut production. And you've got a lot of members of Congress now, including some senators who run important committee saying we need to do something like her tail arm sales to Saudi Arabia or find other ways to basically punish them for this decision. So it's getting ugly. So then Rick, in terms of actual leverage, obviously there tends to be a lot of rhetoric when these things come up. In terms of what can actually be done, how much leverage does the US have?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,146,2022-10-14 20:16:35
3380," So then Rick, in terms of actual leverage, obviously there tends to be a lot of rhetoric when these things come up. But in terms of what can actually be done, how much leverage does the US have, either on its own or if it teams up with allies on this? The United States is a major arm supplier to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia needs those weapons because they have a militant foe right across the Arabian Gulf in Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are long sworn enemies and there has been a kinetic military action between those two nations in the past. So they need American weaponry, including things like Patriot Air Defense, missile batteries. So the United States could remove some US weapons there to help defend Saudi Arabia. The United States could also decide not to sell Saudi Arabia weapons and say, well, why don't you go to your buddy, Russia, and get weapons from them. Of course, Russia is running out of weapons because they're firing all their own weapons at Ukraine. So that's one thing the United States could do, but it might backfire in terms of the oil markets because we are just going to be somewhat dependent on oil producing nations such as Saudi Arabia because in those nations, the government decides how much oil to produce. That is totally different from what happens here. The US government cannot go to Exxon or Chevron and say, you need to increase oil production by 10% or 20%. And here in the United States, energy firms, they do not want to invest in huge fossil fuel energy projects anymore because they don't think they're going to get their money back. They know this is a declining industry. The Saudi government, on the other hand, can keep making those types of investments. So in the future, I think governments like Saudi Arabia could be even more important to fossil fuel industries than they are now. So President Biden has to think about the long term consequences of anything he's likely to do. So, on the Adelaquat Balancing Act indeed, thanks for breaking that down for us, our very own Rick Newman, have a good weekend. Well, post spreading misinformation continued to mount as midterm elections near. A new report from advocacy group the Integrity Institute tracks which platforms are amplifying the spread of misinformation the most. We are who finances tech editor Dan Howley has the details. So down who made the list? Yes, so this is a list from a nonprofit basically looking at what the kind of companies that we see is social media, giants, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, relatively new still are doing as far as spreading misinformation, not themselves but their platforms. And essentially what the result is is that Twitter is on top. And the reason for that is because of the fact that the ability to share, reach, we quickly, any kind of content that comes out is so easy. It's a click away, a tap away that it just allows this kind of information to spread this again through the Integrity Institute basically saying that, you know, that is the number one vector for misinformation to spread easily, easily, not necessarily among social platforms. TikTok also very easy to spread that because of its algorithm. And so, you know, just to give you a sense of the type of misinformation spread, it's because it gets more of a reaction from people. This is what we've heard in the past. It gets more of a reaction. People get angered by something that they see. You know, the cat litter in the classroom thing is one that's going on right now obviously. And so people see that. They think it's a wild idea and so they'll start treating it or re-tweeting it or sharing it along those lines. And so that's why Twitter is on their TikTok on the other hand because of that algorithm. Yeah, that's interesting. So I never thought about just the ease of re-sharing something on Twitter. Now, we're not going to get any reaction likely from TikTok. Is there any reaction from Twitter and anything they can do or have been discussing doing here, Dan, that might change this? Yeah, I think it really just comes down to the different companies and their stance on misinformation and disinformation. You know, there was in this report a kind of reference to what Mark Zuckerberg had put out where misinformation, the closer it gets to or the more of a red line the companies put in the sand, the more it'll start to kind of increase the spread of disinformation. Bye.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,147,2022-10-14 20:19:15
3381," or the more of a red line that companies put in the sand, the more it'll start to kind of increase the spread of this information. So when you kind of see stuff that's getting wildly out of hand, companies will put a red line there and stop allowing it to be spread. But you know, it's kind of a moving target at all times. So companies have a difficult time trying to figure out how they're going to set that up. And I think, you know, Facebook has talked about how they've worked on this, though they have pulled back as they're cutting spending. Twitter has talked about this, but Elon Musk doesn't want to have much moderation. And you know, it's looking increasing the lake. He's going to buy it, but hey, you know, it's a day of the week that ends in Y. So that could change. And you know, TikTok, as you said, we're probably not going to get much out of it, though they said they do try to tamp down on this information, disinformation. So, you know, as long as social media is out there, as long as there's stuff that's easy to spread, as long as people are easy to anger stuff that they see, we're still going to see misinformation disinformation. I mean, it's tough. It's 6,000 tweets per second. When you figure in retweets and everything else, it's like playing whack and we're trying to sort this out. A big thank you, Dan Howley there for us. All right. Well, could the iPhone be getting a new look? An analyst who thinks a foldable iPhone could be on the way joins us next. A new warning from the Centers for Disease Control about the spread of Omicron sub variants Angelic Amlani is here with the details for us. Hi, Anne. Hey, Shana. That's right. We've got some concerns about the growing spread of some of the Omicron sub variants really globally. Right now in the US, we know that's and get ready for the alphabet soup that everyone's been talking about. But the XBB is the one that, you know, oversees has been doing a lot of damage. BA for six. We saw in the US climbing a little bit. We also have another one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,148,2022-10-14 20:23:36
3382," But the XBV is the one that overseas has been doing a lot of damage. B for six, we saw in the US climbing a little bit. We also have another one, the BQ one and 1.1. And so those were two separated joined. They were about 10% of all cases right now. And so that's where the CDC is really keeping an eye. And that's where some of the concern has been coming in recent months. You've been hearing a lot about experts looking at the winter and what the concern over flew as well as surging COVID cases might look like in the pressure that hospital systems might have to face. And that's really what's coming to a head right now. We're starting to see some of these slightly more transmissible variants come through. And that's where the CDC has their warning come in. It we're not quite sure which one might cause, you know, a specific concern for the US yet, but definitely keeping an eye on these and watching and tracking those cases. Especially as we head into the cold, the colder months we want to keep an eye on. Now, Angelie, another story that we're watching, the FDA warning of a shortage of Adderall, what's happening there? That's right. So Adderall, this actually is a couple months old of an issue that is now coming to a head, a Tava pharmaceuticals, which is the largest maker of Adderall in the US, was experiencing some labor shortages. And so that resulted in a shortage of the product as well. And then it puts stress on more generic makers to have to fill the gap. And even there now on back orders. So the FDA has issued now a warning about that notification that there is there is a shortage now. Tava has said that they expect to be able to get back into production and get back into normal production by the end of the month. But those generics might not get back on track until early next year. So it really is a concerning issue right now and just something that's, you know, nothing manufacturing based, but more of a labor issue. And the story that we will continue to watch right. Angelie Camelani, thanks so much. All right, with Apple earnings less than two weeks away, there are no shortage of headlines. Tim Cook, teaming up with Goldman Sachs on bank accounts, a new mixed reality headset on the way, even a report that Taylor Swift music will be featured in Apple Fitness workout programs. Jim Suva is the sitting managing director of equity research out with the new Apple note, essentially saying you can shake it off to those reports of waning iPhone 14 demand. Yeah, I said it. You didn't your price target is 185 that implies a 30% upside. Why Jim? Well, David, it's great to see you again. It's been a long time, but to catch up now as we head into Halloween, it's really not that spooky. The markets have pulled back mostly on the increasing interest rates by the Fed. That being said, consumers, certain pockets are very weak like personal computers. Other pockets like for Apple are quite strong. When you lose or break your iPhone or your AirPods, you replace them very quickly. You don't think about it. Yes, fuel, gas, food and inflation costs have gone higher, but mobile computing and smartphones are here to stay. We believe that Apple has upside and a lot of the press reports about order reductions aren't going to come to pass. Apple actually over orders because there's usually a bottle net or a supply chain hiccup. Those will be remedied. We simply think that pull back in here on Apple warrants a good look at it from investors with a $185 target price. Jim, in that bullet point in your most recent note about the iPhone 14, you also talked about a foldable phone next year. What can you tell us about this? I guess what do you think this will potentially do for Apple's business? Is it going to lure in people that maybe haven't converted to iPhone yet? Or do you think it's just going to help uping the average selling price? Definitely, it's going to up the average selling price. But bringing in more from the Android ecosystem. Right now, there are some Android phones out there. They're doing quite well, but the average price is very, very high. People ask me mostly, what is the business use for it? Hey, it'd be great to be able to walk down the street with maps open and still be getting emails at the same time. Or for those who play video games, have a bigger screen or a split screen, we think it will be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,149,2022-10-14 20:28:05
3383," on the street with maps open and still beginning emails at the same time. Or for those who play video games have a bigger screen or a split screen. We think it will potentially bring an upgrade cycle, but we want Apple to be able to work out the crease or the fold in the phone. The last thing people want is to open a closet 300 times and start to be a hairline craft in the screen. That's why Apple is taking its time coming to market with a foldable phone. But once people start to catch on that this is what they're doing, the market will bring that forward and discount it and it will be a driver to the upside for people spending more money in the Apple ecosystem in totality. And especially for people who love the gadgets and have been looking for some innovation on the product side, not always on the service line for Apple, which they've been focusing on. That'll be a big selling point. I know you're also talking your note about what we've seen with the strong dollar offsetting some of these supply chain concerns, which is now started to ease. How much of a game changer is that going to be for Apple? You know, it's something definitely to keep an eye on foreign exchanges. Very important, but also note the COVID shutdown in the closures, whether it be in China or other parts of the world, China, India, all these other places that had to have big shutdown. That hurts Apple to front both on the product side and also on the services. The Apple stores are closed. You can't go in and get warranty. You can't get help. You can't get upgrades and you can't get additional peripherals. So simply put, we believe that internationally as COVID gets behind us, yes, FX is a headwind, but we believe that opening up a society of people getting out and going shopping more is going to be a positive for Apple. They've navigated through COVID remarkably well with the hard work of their suppliers, their supply chain and the employees themselves. Once people get back and do more, they start to break their phones, drop their phones and then look to replace them, but simply put, Apple has navigated this very well. FX is negatively impacting all the U.S. companies, but their supply chain has been remarkably impressive. Jim, want to talk some sports streaming here. Apple has the deal with major league soccer, still no deal between Apple and the NFL and this expected Sunday NFL ticket package. What is your expectation in terms of Apple making an entry into sports streaming beyond the MLS? And what do you make Eddie Q had a service to saying we were not interested in buying sports rights earlier this week on a panel in New York? And if I could just tack on one more, how significant is sports streaming for the investor story? Dave, that's a brilliant question and spot on that's important, but that's one of the pedestals they're looking at, but there's many, many, many more. Whether it be movies, whether it be artists and you started off the show by talking about some of that, there's just a lot of content that Apple wants to put on its platform. Yes, my family is on Apple TV, Apple TV, plus we watched up, we stream it. But the amount of content while it's wholesome for me and my family, the number of options is still fairly limited. Any way to increase that is a positive sports, music, artists, entertainment, lots of ways to do it. We viewed as a positive sports can be expensive. You got to do it right. You got to entertain it with people. You got to have the backgrounds, the foregrounds, the speakers, the commentators. It's live. You can't do a repeat. You can't do a retake of it. Other things like movies and contents, they're doing more and more with that. But we expect the Apple TV for it to be plus plus plus as we go down the road to be more and more. But right now it's lacking a lot. Sports is one of those things that it's lacking. And Jim, I want to ask you about this report from the information talking about Apple's mixed reality headset, perhaps offering some of this iris scanning to incorporate payments. Where do you see the Apple ecosystem going and growing? You know, that's a very forward looking question that is spot on and why people should own the stock. It's the ecosystem and the platform. Right now we've been talking about iPhones a lot. And the reality is going down the road. There's no reason why people in education or pilots or other people shouldn't be putting on AR VR goggles. And see what it's like in biology class looking inside the human body to learn. Bingo.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,150,2022-10-14 20:32:45
3384," people shouldn't be putting on AR VR goggles and see what it's like in biology class looking inside the human body to learn. Why developing countries can't get better education in medical sciences. Why to get your kitchen or your house renovated in architect, can't go in and take pictures and you put on headsets and see the different paint colors and where the appliances go. This is all eventually coming. People talk about gaming. Yeah, gaming is important for AR and VR but there's a lot of society that can really do better. You think about the home repair person coming to fix a water heater. They can put on the goggles and learn what's wrong instead of having to go out and be taught by an apprentice for two to three years. AR VR we think is going to be very big for Apple down the road. And this important platform of family of products will just add to the economics that are positive for Apple. I'm looking forward to those headsets. They may not be the first out in the market but they're typically tested and a very good experience. And that's where the magic meet. The hardware plus the software for our magical experience. And that's what Apple is all about. Jim Suga always great to have you come visit us again. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a good weekend. Thank you. Bye bye. Supermarket giant Kroger just acquired a competitor in Albert Sins. A new survey reveals how many companies are looking to make a similar move in the next 12 months. Also be sure to tune in to Yahoo! Finances all markets. Summit Monday starting at 9 a.m. Eastern Moderna CEO. Stephanie Bankel and Target CEO Brian Cornell just two of the many industry leaders joining the program. Get on one of this. Breaking news now. Nikola founder Trevor Milton has been found guilty of defrauding investors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,151,2022-10-14 20:36:29
3385," Breaking news now, Nikola founder Trevor Milton has been found guilty of defrauding investors. Prosecutors alleged the former CEO lied to investors about his electric truck startup technology something Milton denied. Milton was charged with two counts of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. George found him guilty on one count of securities fraud and both of the wire fraud counts. Well two of the largest US supermarkets are merging. We talked about this before. Kroger has agreed to buy Albertsons for $24.6 billion. Now this comes as a majority of executives find themselves altering their investment plans. As we take a look, 93% of CEOs say they've made alterations to investment plans and made geopolitical turmoil and that's according to a new survey from EY. That over half still say they expect to pursue an acquisition in the next year. Mitch Berlin, EY America's strategy and transactions vice chair joins us now. Then you talked about this being that everywhere all at once, similar to the movie, a lot of things that some of these CEOs are having to contend with. How is this affecting the landscape? What were the biggest findings in your study? Well, I think not surprising, inflation is top of mind for all the CEOs that we spoke to. We interviewed over 760 CEOs around the world and 65% of them expect their earnings to be impacted by inflation. That's really due to the input prices, which include labor, raw materials, energy and freight. There's only so much of that cost they can pass back on to the end consumer. The CEOs that I work with on a daily basis actually are looking at ways to take out costs so they can still meet their bottom line and other ways so they can reimagine their business to be a leaner, more efficient version of what they are today. So I would expect it over the next six to nine months. You're going to see a lot of restructuring and reorganizations in corporate America. And Mitch Rochelle, let the intro there with the news today from Kroger and Albert Sins in the surveys at 52% of the CEOs are still pursuing M&A. Any idea just in terms of why and I guess why they would be a little bit more optimistic than I think we would have initially thought at this point. Yeah, well the interesting thing, Sean, is that when we look at the difference between the US results and the rest of world results, the US CEOs are more bold. They know that they need to transact to transform. And they're still very bold on what's going on. They're bold on growth and they know that in order to stay ahead of the competition, the fastest way to get there is to remanate. And you said it's more about prudent deal making. What are some of the conversations that they're having when trying to determine what should be an acquisition versus say a joint venture? I think they're really concerned around not overpaying. The multiples last year were off the charts. And so what we're seeing is particularly with corporates that they're doing much more diligence and making sure they're doing the right deal now for the right price. We haven't seen a lot of private equity in the market over the last couple months. We expect that they will come back as a cost of capital. Continuous to increase. We would expect that the corporates would retreat a little bit because the deals become more expensive for them. But the private equities are still sitting on a lot of dry powder. They'll re-enter the market and take advantage of the lower valuations and that's important for them because I think there was a lot of overpayment in the last year. Mitch, one big trend that we've been following very closely, obviously, is this tightly labor market has spent a huge challenge for companies to lure in some of that top talent? Did this come up in your conversations with CEOs? And I guess what are they doing in order to attract talent to their firms? Yeah, the input costs was a big issue for our CEOs in terms of inflation. And so talent is one of the major input costs. The survey really did not touch a lot on the different things that they're doing to attract talent. But we do know that clearly it's been a significant impact. I mean, unemployment is its lowest rate in what, 50 years now, at 3%. So it is a tightly labor market out there. And Mitch, obviously, we're in a very different place than we were two years ago when the pandemic was first kicking in. In terms of our CEOs and our thinking of the pandemic and the pandemic-related issues that they're focusing on when they're trying to come up with their strategies, what were their priorities? Well, it's interesting because the pandemic is still the number one concern. I think you're earlier segment around the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,152,2022-10-14 20:41:09
3386," What were their strategies? What were their priorities? Well, it's interesting because the pandemic is still the number one concern. I was listening to your earlier segment around the CDC sort of concern around the rise in COVID. But when the CEOs are talking about the pandemic, they're really using it as a proxy for broader issues. So it's not just the health concerns that we had two years ago. It's the inflation. It's the increased input costs, labor and such. It is supply chain issues that factory shutdowns in China. Those are all top of mind for our CEO. So the pandemic was the number one concern for them. But following behind that, like eight points behind that, though, so a distant second was regulatory concerns followed by geopolitical concerns and then also climate change. Okay. Certainly lots for them to continue with a big thank you. Mitch Berlin for joining us from EY. Thanks so much. Thank you. All right. This week ended with a bang in terms of bank earnings. It continues next week. Here's what I'm watching for Monday. Bank of America reports before the open consent assessment show total revenue climbing by about 3% as rising interest income more than offsets, falling investment banking fees. Tuesday, Goldman Sachs reports before the bell. Estimates calling for net interest income to grow by 31% from a year ago. And while total revenue is expected to decline for a third consecutive quarter at the courting to Jeffries, Netflix also reports on Tuesday. The big question, will they add subscribers after two straight quarterly losses? This on the heels of Thursday's announcement that the ad tier will cost 699 per month. Wednesday, you got Tesla reporting earnings following a disappointing third quarter delivery. Volumes falling short of expectations. Thursday, snap the first of the big tech companies to report after the close and give us a glimpse of the softening digital ad market. We wrap up with Friday American Express reports before the bells to the downgraded MX to sell, warning that the possible deceleration and spending volume is not fully considered by investors. All right. Some breaking news now, the Wall Street Journal reporting that Rupert Murdock is looking to recombine newscorp and Fox corporations. Allie Canal is here with the details. Interesting this was broken, of course, by Wall Street Journal. Right. Which she technically owns. Which will be dramatically impacted by this. What are we learning? I mean, it's very interesting. It's an interesting move. A recombination, right? If you remember, in 2013, these two holdings were originally separated. The publishing side and then the TV and the film side. But at 91 years old, apparently reportedly he wants to re-emerge those entities. And if you think about the brands under all of this, obviously under Fox, you have the broadcast network along with some local television stations, 2B, which is a popular streaming service. And then newscorp is the parent company of Dow Jones. As you mentioned, the Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins, as well as some other news organizations in the UK and Australia. Now, currently, FoxCorp has a market cap of about 17 billion newscorp, roughly half of that at 9 billion. But according to the report, we're in the very early stages of these talks. It's possible. It won't happen. But maybe he's just looking at the media environment right now, because there is a lot of consolidation. We had the Amazon purchase of MGM, ViacomCBS merger, Warner Brothers discovering merger. Maybe he's reassessing what's going on in the landscape right now. It just seems. Trial balloon. Because there's going to be some major blowback, big personalities and big wigs in the media world learning they're going to be back in bed with Fox News. That's going to be... That is true. They're will be. And also just from a completely business standpoint, just taking a look at the performance, we had the one month chart up of both of the companies. But we take a look at the year-to-day chart of newscorp. It hasn't necessarily finished Trump performance for the company year-to-day. It's all 30% through a need of some help. Maybe this is something or what they see as a strategic opportunity here in order to boost the business going. Right, and that's true. And like I mentioned with the market cap too, newscorp, just $9 billion, Foxcorp, $17 billion, maybe they'll take some of that money and help newscorp out there. But that really, to me, is the only main, I guess, motivator for Rupert. Yeah. It's interesting. I was surprised to see...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,153,2022-10-14 20:45:27
3387," this court about there, but that really, to me, is the only main, I guess, motivator for Rupert. Yeah. It's interesting. I was surprised to see this report. I'm not going to lie. Well, it's something that we will, of course, closely follow here. Allie, while we have you, let's stick with the media space because Netflix. We're going to be hearing from the company next week. They report after the bill on Tuesday. The sauce gun, a bit of its momentum back over the last couple of months. But what do you think we're going to hear? Well, this earnings report is going to be very interesting because in the first time for a very long time, it's not going to be all about subscribers. It's going to be about profitability. New revenue streams. Obviously, a big one there is the advertising tear, which we got a lot of details on yesterday, after that announcement from Netflix. If you take a look at the number, so revenue expected to come in at $7.85 billion, adjusted earnings per share, $2.22. And then subscriber net additions, Netflix guided 1 million. That's roughly in line with consensus estimates. I do think we are going to see net additions this time around after the platform shed 1.2 million subscribers in the first half of the year. And I largely think that's going to be because of content, right? Like, DOMER, which we've talked about all together. That's just been crushing it week after week. And then, you know, overall, it's really all going to be about advertising. Analysts are very bullish on this. UBS raised its price target by $52 to $250 a share. Getting that ad tear could provide a 10% boost to total revenue. So that's going to be the main focus. Of course, we have those macro headwinds, potential pressure from foreign exchange. That could impact margins and revenue. But overall, I don't think really investors are going to care too much about that. They're going to want to hear about the ad. It's down the road. We're all waiting to see the impact of that ad tear. All right, Canal. Good stuff. Have a good weekend. Thanks. All right, coming up, if you're interested in buying a pre-owned Rolex, you might be able to get a deal. I'll tell you why next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,155,2022-10-14 20:53:14
3388," All right, as we wrap up the trading week, let's take a look at some of the biggest stock Movers. First up, a mega deal in the grocery space. Croger reaching a deal to buy Albert Sense for 24.6 billion. The combined company is going to employ more than a 700,000 people across about 5,000 stores. Take a look at the movement that we saw in New yesterday that a deal was imminent sense shares of Albert Sense above $28 per share. Although it looks like it was a buy of the rumor, sell the news type of deal. Also questions about whether or not this is going to be approved from regulators. I think that's a big driver in the stock price today. You see Albert Sense closing the day off just around 8.5% on a two day basis. You're still looking at a gain of just around 2% Croger on an intraday basis closing the day off 7%. All right, let's take a look at Pepsi. Now the company kicking off third quarter earning season on a pretty upbeat no here in a five day chart. You can see that shares up just around 5% the company beating up both the top and bottom lines. Also raising its guidance to find any fears of a slowdown. Sending shares up about 4% on Wednesday. Taking a look at that five day chart, you can see the pop in shares shortly after Pepsi did report. Now third quarter revenue jumping 9% from a year ago while profit expanded more than 20% Pepsi. Now sees full year revenue growth of 12% the latest raise. Mark the third time that the company is actually up to its full year forecast this year. And again, that week to date performance here was shares closing up just over 5%. All right, let's round it out with Delta now the stock jumping a third quarter profit of 695 million as higher fairs. Health offset some of those rising jet fuel prices. Now the carrier offered up beat fourth quarter guidance to noting a resurgence in corporate travel and also signs of a strong holiday rush. A bullish note from Calence sending shares up once again today. You see the second a daily basis at least closing up just around 2% that five day gain there for Delta up nearly 6% and really setting the tone from what we could see from some of those larger carriers. All right, finishing the week strong there. Well market volatility though now impacting the luxury watch market according to a recent note from Morgan Stanley. Now the finance is price to Romanian and watch connoisseur is here with the latest so price what do we need to know? Yeah, you know, Rochelle, as you can't actually buy these watches and stores, you can't actually buy them online secondhand market and that's where they're sort of getting smoked right now from a price point of view, the big three Rolex, Patek Philippe and AP, they come from about 70% of the market. You've seen their prices down at least 8%. The Rolex they tone it down 21%. This has dealers and sort of people that are collect watches, have been flooding the market recently trying to get trying to sell these Rolexes and APs and things like that as their values had kind of shot up. Now we're seeing a weakening macro environment. People are trying to sell into that and that's going to see these prices come down a lot. I do want to say though that watches as an asset are up compared to the markets since January 2021 compared that that's a few top 100 and also compared to Bitcoin. So you still have some value there but right now into Q4 especially you're going to see these prices come down dramatically according to Morgan Stanley. Luxury shopping market has shown very little demand destruction. I assume the retail market is healthy and is there never had a Rolex watch? Is there like a stock X goat as there is for sneakers? Where do you buy these? There are sites like Bob's watches and others that do sell these watches secondhand. They verify their authenticity and things alike. I think Chrono 24 also. So these actually they've taken the stock, they verify and they sell it. And those guys are seeing their stock of watches sort of skyrocket right now. So that's why we've seen these prices like Rolex, down 8%, paddock down 8%, which is kind of dramatic in the last quarter or so. But you see a move like this. I mean lots of questions about what this market is going to look like a quarter maybe two quarters from now. When you see this drop today is this something that they see as a new normal do you think? I think it has to be. There was such a run up pushing the Bitcoin kind of craze. These watches got so much. I mean the draw state owners I think is like average.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,155,2022-10-14 20:54:56
3389," As a new normal, do you think? I think it has to be. There was such a run up, pushing the Bitcoin kind of craze. These watches got so much. I mean, the Drollist Daytona is the thing is like average price, 30,000. You could buy it if you could find a retail for like 13. So that's why we're seeing these corrections happening. Probably we'll come closer back to retail. I mean, why should the second AMR could be way more than retail? It's just out of control. Yeah. Resonate with used cars for a while, right? Like people returning their these cars, they were selling over the price. I do want to say one thing. I was at the vacation recently at the Rome airport. The Rolex are walking. Just to see what's going on. They had watches on display. Can't buy. You can try them on, but you can't buy them. They're just display watches. Wow. I don't get it. No supply. Where are you going in my one if you good? No, God. He's already gone. Prowl, thank you. Have a good weekend, my friend. Appreciate that. Coming up, workers at several California-based tech companies are among the happiest with their pay. According to new report, find out which firm is at the top of the list. And we come back. Music. I want to give you an update on a story we reported earlier in the show. A federal judge has denied a request for a battle-theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes. Holmes sought documents from the company's former lab director who testified against Holmes at trial. The former lab director may have testified untruthfully at trial. The ruling is a setback for Holmes, hearing on Monday where she's asking for a new trial. We'll keep you posted on that. Well, high inflation, the possibility of a recession, there's no shortage of reasons for employees to be unsatisfied with their pay. But comparably.com compiled a list of companies where staff are the most happy with their pay. We are Adobe Ring Central and Meta, which is interesting because we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRIayi6dbGM,156,2022-10-14 20:58:40
3390," But comparably.com compiled a list of companies where staff are the most happy with their pay. The top three are Adobe Ring Central and Meta, which is interesting because we haven't heard too many positive headlines about Meta so I was surprised to see them up there. Any surprises for you in this list, Sean? You know, yeah, I would be very curious to exact date that this was taken because I don't think Meta would any longer wish I'll exactly write the in that top five, maybe not even top 20 list. I don't know. We'll see how everything plays out there. And I don't think it was any surprise here when you take a look at the top names in this list, majority of them are tech firms. And we've known that for a while just in terms of the incentives that they offer employees, the fact that they have so many benefits. One Adobe employee was cited in this survey saying that they really appreciate the child care costs. The coverage that Adobe pays for when it comes to their child care up until the age of six. So I think once you have incentives, pay equals what you think you should be making benefits, exceed sometimes what you necessarily expected. It's no surprise that these employees are very happy. I was a little taken aback by the prevalence of California firms on this list. Eight of the top 10 companies in terms of happiness were from the state of California where taxes are through the roof. So clearly they are being compensated for the high tax environment. But what you'll find underneath a lot of these companies is a satisfaction with pay transparency, which is really coming of age, we're going to hear more about that in California and New York. And when that happens, it tends to spread throughout the rest of the country. And I think that is something you're going to be hearing a lot more about in the years ahead. People need to know ballpark what the people next to them are making to be satisfied. Yeah, just clear standard. How you pay and the path to growth will show. Yes. And one thing that was interesting with the people's happiness with stock prices, and when you consider what's been happening with tech this year, the fact that that was one of the things that was considered, I thought I was very interesting. Yeah. It is very interesting. But a good group here, at least if you're in the market for a new job, you need to check out with this list.
