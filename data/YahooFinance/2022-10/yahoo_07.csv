Exactly. Good morning, Julie. So, you know, I think right now, the whole market is focused on the macro outlook. You know, what's gonna happen with the economy as a result of tighter financial conditions and high interest rates? And so, that's creating a lot of girations through not just equities but all risk assets and all market prices and so Your financials are really I think at the center of the economic outlook. You know, when people feel good about the economy, financials tend to do well when people are nervous, financials are not really a defensive area and so you're seeing that play through I think in the stocks right now and and no doubt there's some negative news and uncertainty in the market but Maybe take a step back and just talk about your what is happening longer term with these business models and and and also where they trading from evaluation perspective and so our view is that over the long term your higher rate will be positive you have to work through you know some of the you know near term uncertainty but Where already pricing these stocks so this isn't the beginning of the sell off they're already down for the most part on the big bank side 25 to 30% from their highs ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPvH7FUw7-4,2,2022-09-23 13:52:27

Hello there, I wanna start with oil prices actually because the move that we are seeing today is fairly remarkable Oil here right now down almost six% for WTI below $80 a barrel so that's the first time we've seen going below that threshold in quite some time here you have the 3 month chart four crude oil prices and this is really feeding over into what we are seeing in terms of the groups within the S and P 500 as well As I'm trying to figure out how to get us to the sectors here. I'm going the wrong direction. Apparently, here we go. As we go down to the sectors, we are seeing energy stocks really under pressure here. Energy stocks down about Right now, they were down as much as six. Four% as a group earlier in the session. So, this again, I really wanna put a fine point on this. This is the best Group of the year. We have been seeing oil prices, slide gasoline at the pump, has slid as we've talked about before for 100 straight days before pausing in that slide, but if this is any indication for what we are seeing with oil prices and energy stocks, we could continue to see a cap on gasoline prices by extension. Here's the year in nature chart. Still 28% for the year. So, really important move here that we are seeing today in energy prices is really a breakdown in the stocks. Consumer discretionary also under pressure today. That's the your date. It's exactly the inverse down 28%. And still down today and then real quick check on builder on the material stocks.

Same way to compete more with TikTok and so, Is this really going to result in people moving away from TikTok creators moving away from TikTok to go over to YouTube shorts? You know, I think that's their goal obviously. I think they're giving away what 45% of their revenue is or their ad revenue is meant to be going towards creators which is I've talked to creators who are in the creator fund for TikTok and they are not seeing numbers even close to that like for a creator to make it on their own what they're often finding is that they have to do some brand deals like they have to work From businesses if they wanna actually make a living off of TikTok.

Well Kiko it's almost impossible to know that and in all honesty none of us know what the real price points gonna be for Netflix we don't know how they're gonna market it Rising price sensitivity amongst Netflix customers and we've seen declining satisfaction at least on their most mature markets like the US and then when we look at what the other streaming companies are doing they're able to generate five to 10 Subscription pricing by 2 to 3 dollars and still generate more revenue per user because they can get $five plus an adreb new per So we got something that kinda addresses the price sensitivity and is positive for unit economics.

We were expecting that turn around to really happen at this at this meeting. But indeed another 75 and and continuing to November.

1990,"Thing for them. They will risk a recession if that is what is needed in order to get inflation down. Ultimately we think that is what will be needed and that a recession happens by the middle of next year. But it really I think from a the perspective they need to get inflation, pressures down, they need to have very clear convincing evidence That that inflation is back on a path down toward their target in order to pivot at some point where I'm more delish messaging but ultimately we don't think that that's happening this year. We think it's destroyed for next year once a recession. And there's dynamics are are far clear. Now we got some commentary or or speak I believe it was on Friday from from J Pal saying that we might be heading to a new economic normal what is that look like in your estimation And how long might it last Sure so I think we we have two things to focus on from the Fed's perspective. It's the near term how did it deal deal with high inflation, a very tight labor market, and how they get inflation back down closer to two%. That dynamic we think ultimately works its way out with a recession with a Fed tightening bar, aggressively Probably rising to somewhere between five and a half and six% and then I think there's a second Climate change policies are all likely to be supported permanently perspective I think one thing that the economies also currently dealing with is not enough labor supply. It's a key driver of high wage growth. You see firms that still need to find workers. Job openings are near record high levels. And I think those two things together tell you potential growth in the Is likely lower going forward. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpyHDEpJomQ,53,2022-09-26 17:36:26

Should help to bring down inflationary pressures but most of the goods inflationary pressures we've seen have been on the supply sign and supply constraints So I think it is something that helps the bed but I think the bed needs a lot more help than that.

They need credit spreads to be wider. And I think this is over the past several months. You know, the Fed gave a message at the From sea meeting. The market responded by really easing financial conditions and I think we we that triggered the feds eventual more hockey's response from CheerPal over the past several months particularly at Jackson Financial conditions it'll come through a number of channels the currency one is instantly one of them but I think the fed also needs to see tightening come through equity market Matt we're we're seeing discretionary names in the equities market right now get get a little bit of nibbling action as we kick off today's trading session in this week's trading do you believe that with indiscretionary there are some Resilient pockets than others that are perhaps not as directly impacted by either inventory or supply chain concerns as others because those are things that are definitely out of the Jurisdiction if you will Yeah I think you're having an economy that is is has multiple phases going on here.

You know, stocks have completed this round trip voyage and and and at their new all-time lows for the year. They rose over the summer but then have come all the way back and European stocks, you know, Andrea into a pair of market as equities rallied from mid June to mid August this year.

Well, that's hard to say. I think I think one of the concerns is are we going to get a mild recession or a deep one? I think a mild recession is probably more than priced in at this point. The question is, how much deeper is that going to go? Of course, that's very dependent upon central banks. Do they continue to push higher and higher wanting to be the poll volcars of their era until they get Policy rates into real Territory right now.

I think investors wanna focus on quality stocks across sectors not just trying to pick out a sector too that might be out performing one of the ways we've defined quality this year or what we call short duration stocks. Companies that get more of their cash flows in the near term than out over the next several years. So, that's a lower price to cash flow ratio. Those Even in the month of September. So, focusing on that is important. Second, I think high dividend payers. A very similar theme companies paying a high dividend generally a good cash flow and strong balance sheets. Those stocks have been doing very well this year. Not avoided losses but really I've only experienced about half the losses of the overall market. So, it's another theme investors wanna keep in mind. High dividend payers In every sector are outperforming you don't just have to go to those classic high dividend pairs and say utilities or or telecom you can find them even in the text sector the highest dividend pairs are the outperformers Jeffrey, do you have some cash on the sidelines right now like some of our viewers likely do? Are you putting money to work or should investors wait maybe for some of this volatility to calm down? Well I think it I I think you can use volatility as your friend if you if you've got a long time horizon you've got some cash I think dollar cost averaging into this type of a volatile market does make long term sense are they trying to pick a bottom is very hard you know increasingly we're seeing more value even in the bond market despite the sell out there with high yield bonds now yielding over nine% We've got you know divide to the US are now higher than they've been in quite some time.

All of it's supposed to come through economic growth. There's no real challenge to how they're gonna spend money and so basically, there's been a loss of confidence in the guilt market in Sterling.

We saw a massive rebound in data surprises and data expectations. Through right after the the economy started to reopen. We had a massive reflectionary trade. Because of all the stimulus we got. Now, we've seen the removal of the stimulus and some of the normalization. So, I For the next 12 months is gonna be challenging. I think the next 6 months, we still have the dollar Embedded there by 12 to 14% against specific currency pairs And Mark I just wanna quickly ask you about the new Italian Prime Minister obviously Italy the third largest economy in in Europe what are you keeping an eye on there and do you expect any shift as a result of this?

There's some economists are saying we will see significant slowing. What do you make of the fact that it has been so resilient and do we need to see it substantially slow in order to get inflation under control? Well it is an issue of supply and demand right we have more people that want to hire people than those that wanna work so that's part of the issue with the inflation and wages what I would say is we are hearing about some layoffs coming up with some companies not all companies but some and those are the individuals Have to be cautious and make sure that they've got an emergency fund a lot of cash on the sidelines to help make up for potential lost wages so it it is a little bit of a balance of two you know cities in Ascends but we'll see what happens that's that's basically what we're looking at for our clients we're telling you to be cautious to be thoughtful and almost to be Boring with where they're putting their money right now.

Yeah I think that is a best thing thing you know for example we talked about when when We're talking about how to tax billionaires more at least this is something that Democrats have wanted to do for a while and yet they're this tax plan that we had really didn't include any explicit taxes on billionaires and yet we saw you know at the top of this list for examples Amazon and Berkshire that are held largely by to a very very very mischillioners so the idea Is that if you own a corporation, it's not actually the corporation that has made worse off by taxes. It's the it can be the shareholders, it can be the customers, it can be employees, and also, so does some extent that people who own Berkshire and own Amazon. I know in all these other corporations will be made worse off and that does include a number of very famous billionaires. And in terms of the sectors that are most exposed. I know we're looking at perhaps manufacturing and some other some other sectors as well. There are certain sectors that really stand out to you here.

Jeffrey, you don't expensive work here just in terms of what companies will be affected to what extent. They will be affected.

We're all central banks are tightening in a synchronized manner but in an uncoordinated matter. And this combine tightening of monetary policy around the world We'll have consequences that I'm not sure everyone is capturing at this point. And so when you look at obviously what the feathers looking at is is backwards looking when you look at some of the CPI data and there was concern that perhaps you should sort of wait and sort of see how these things are impacting the real economy before continuing to be so aggressive what's your take on that I think all Central Banks and all policy makers right now are convinced that they need to regain control over inflation. They were all a bit late to the game in terms of tightening monetary policy in the face of what has become persistently elevated inflation and they want to regain control over the inflation and the inflation narrative. And in doing so, they will want to tighten monetary Aggressively continue doing so even if that entails some pain in the form of higher unemployment rate and has power set it below potential trend growth that means essentially that the fed another central banks are looking for a significant cooling of demand a significant tightening of financial conditions and they won't back down at Signs of an economic slowdown. If anything, that slowdown is what they want to see to hope for lower inflation.

And and sticking with the consumer in terms of where we are with supply and demand. Are we seeing any sort of leveling off at this point? Any sort of parity coming in now? We are in some sectors. We are starting to see this delicate rebalancing act taken place and as you correctly note one of the big issues right now is that there are number of sectors that are still in balanced.

In other words, some parents may argue. Well, you know, if there's any benefit, then, then, I'll accept what I think is a low risk. Another Any any risk I don't wanna risk that if if the benefit is so low. So I think I just don't think it's gonna make much of an impact anotherwise healthy young people.

They did not raise by 125 basis points at the last meeting I did not really expect Because in my mind this is a relatively davish fed So, I could bank on about 75 basis points which is what I got. The advantage of 125 basis points would have been Way ahead of the market Ahead of the curve I'm dead after they will not have to do very much. This way around they increase it by 75 the market is expecting under the 75 in November And the market will keep expecting that for a few more meetings They are going to increase even more than they would have had they given a one big move in last month Actually with that said you know we're just talking about the comments that we got from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans today about the concerns that many others have raised about moving too aggressively in too soon Obviously you weren't anticipating the 125 basis points. That's what you said. They should be doing but how big of a risk is that factor? In terms of going too quickly, when we haven't Sincerely seen Policy at least the intended impact of it take hold yet.

2060,So if you are looking for interest rate increases to come to an end or to slow down One way to do it is to have a credit event and the Fed reacts to it by saying now our job is to save the system Think about 1998 with a long term capital management which unexpectedly collapsed in the aftermath of higher interest rates earlier in the decade. Think about 2008 when Lehman brothers went down Policy shifted to ESA. And that is one of my scenarios as a possibility for the future Scenario would be that the very strong dollar Because the strong dollar reads to typically leads to financing issues and if that happens and if you have a coordinated Of supporting the dollar like we did with the plaza accord in 1985 that will be a turn around in policy as well so you need accidents to change it your knock it's not going to happen With the normal course of time Finally Shri while we're talking about the fed right now obviously we're in a global higher rate environment a lot of focus being placed on the bank of England given what has played out over the last few days the huge swing that we've seen in the pound also on the back of these tax cuts that have been propos By this new administration.

I mean, is that sort of how investors should be looking at these utility names as we go into the winter months and look at these major price likes. No i don't think so at all all of those companies profit on higher commodity prices utilities really only have their fortunes based on solid regulation and the investments that they have in their company so if the price of natural gas goes It really is a pass through from from the utility to the customer. So, it's an unfortunate situation for the customers. It also, you know, no utility likes to see bills go up. A because they don't have any benefit from it but be You know it it really it's just not good for the relationship with their customer and their and their regulator so you know again I don't I don't think you have to to worry about You know weather or not the commodity is going to to affect the the profits of these companies new certainly shouldn't be investing in utilities to say go long natural gas or or something like that These are conservative investments The you know, plenty of stocks that yield out, you know, well, over three%, have their, they're earnings growth, you know, inaccessive five% so they really the opportunity ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbqt2Pa1J9E,39,2022-09-27 16:37:16

We're out of control type one diabetes. We're even a mild illness could land them in the hospital and then thirdly the people who are immune compromise.

Instead of some controversy over having this opinion and and sharing this insight what do you think the the future outlook is for COVID vaccines are we looking at annual shots or are we still dealing with the situation where it's still pretty unpredictable? I think we have to be very good at at monitoring on a worldwide level whether there is a variant that arises that is resistant to protection against serious so so even if you've been vaccinated or naturally affected or both it doesn't matter you would still be at risk for severities and when that happens then we're starting all over again. Original yet because even though these BA four BA five variants are resistant to protection against miles east for most they aren't resistant to protection against severe disease so we're still good in that sense that original vaccine which was made against the so called Wuhan one strain which was a sprain that raised its head in in China has still worked well to protect against against ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMzGq1hnpU,38,2022-09-28 16:29:53

He also pointed to some of the novel inventions replacing intermediates with smart contracts that also require regular attention your reaction to that Yeah so that's a very interesting problem to look at right now you know the central banks give banks money to pay interest rates etcetera with crypto there's no there's no direct way to do that and they are interest generating products but they're actually I don't think the most of them are loud. I think the there's some regulatory agencies that View against that. So, you'd be interesting to see which view plans out. Building on that back to that op ed in terms of regulations you write that advanced regulations for crypto goes against the ethos but it that it would foster innovation and establish trust so my question is if the US were to come out with clear rules or regulating Would that really help riptoe blossom when we see more money funneled into the sector advancing faster adoption both on the part of corporations and consumers and ultimately does that lift us out of the crypto winter?

So, to be honest, it's very hard to tell. There's a few different prints, well, that's a few different logics here. Why is when there's high interest rate, people should want a hard cash or deposit back in your banks But the banking interest rate is nothing comparable to crippler right now with stating your general generating products And even like D five D five give you very good returns much higher than the bank and the money doesn't leave the D five protocol so the other aspect is the quick place still very much a correlated with a stock market which is actually counter intuitive But I guess today most of the crypto traders are also stock traders So when the stock market tanks and they wanna hold cash and then actually cry to market goes with it in theory they should be inversely correlated but we have not seen that quite just just yet I think it will take a couple of years to To see that. So, yeah, so it's just a few different Aspect of place very hard to predict in one shot like what are the fed policies gonna affect crypto and also yeah crypto is much more international the user based for that is much more diverse we see like in other Continents like Africa, Latin America.

The higher prices or they don't wanna wait cuz that's a new thing too. And that is not happening either. I think that this is probably not the system that is exactly ideal so we probably are just gonna have to Where it's not as if you're gonna lose customers cuz that really is the danger Auto companies as well as dealers as they're just gonna walk because someone else can offer them a car in 3 weeks and maybe at MSRP versus waiting 2 months and you know a few $1000 over on SRP Just got how much of this is because of that when we talk about the increase in cost here how much of it is because of the Consumer. Yeah i mean there's probably a few dynamics going and one is consumer driven over the years people especially in this country we've wanted larger vehicles we want more options as a result a lot of companies especially Detroit companies they shuttered their smaller car lines so that is a naturally driven the price of vehicles up and then we hit this supply short Propelled ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMzGq1hnpU,45,2022-09-28 16:59:43

Is that surprise you? Really, you know, when you look at, when you look at the numbers that the what surprising is the polling number is 70% of millennials feel they're look for support, look very favorably upon unions and that when it says surprise, I'm happy to see that.

So, you know, you know, this helps them also serve more more people faster because in the drive thru, if you're line piles up You know, people are turning away.

We can't have mortgages, you know, as as mentioned earlier up above But moving 20 basis points each day in order to have the risk of your assets classes stabilize so that's number one secondarily we need to have more certainty with respect to the bed path of future tightening and typically we see you know pretty volatile Moves in equity markets in the last couple of months leading into the fed sort of peak in the hiking cycle we're not there yet and so until we see you know more certainty with regards to a stabilization of the path of the bed hiking cycle we can't expect to see stability within equity ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iZhU71SmU,34,2022-09-29 16:13:06

What you're seeing from the consumer is a managing down in terms of their cost and so they're doing so by looking at cheaper options whether it's for food, eating more at home, At stores with bigger discounts that are you know best in class in terms of price like some of the big box retailers and and looking at you know how they they can save in terms of their discretionary spend. So I think that stocks that will do well in this environments or ones that are you know typically the trade down socks. At home stocks the big box retailers and the names that you know tend to do well in sort of risk off environments because people are really managing their cost lower and you know looking to see where they can so names that are highly discretionary like travel and leisure I think we're gonna get hit home builders I think Retailers will probably get hit as well but you know the ones that are really focused on providing essentials are the names that I think can outperform.

And it's poor countries which are for all of contribut Least to the climate crisis that are most exposed to its ill effects On that point we did get some news last week from UN Climate Week the the developed countries for long have been calling for some sort of compensation if that's the right term for the climate crisis that is envolded they would argue as a result of emissions that have been put out from major economies like the US as well as China we saw Mark come out and make some commitments on that front as well where do you stand on that in you know the US is long argue that the money could be better spent Mitigation efforts and sort of instead of just handing a blank check as they would describe it I mean where do you think Countries should be stepping in on this very issue when that humanitarian crisis you just described as already been unfolding. Yeah that's good to face this question On. The truth is that it is rich countries that have created the climate crisis. There's no doubt about that. In terms of what we need to do I'm afraid we have to do both. We have to mitigate future climate By chain decarbonizing changing taking the carbon out of energy systems in the rich world we also have to mitigate future danger by helping the poorest countries develop in a way that doesn't repeat our mistakes but we also have to adapt I'm afraid it's too late now to have a choice between ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iZhU71SmU,41,2022-09-29 16:43:20

I'm not good enough to tell you what'll happen on a day-to-day basis but I can't tell you what we're talking about with investors and that risk that we do see the market move higher in the coming quarter is very top of mine with our clients. As I said have you seen mutual funds cut risk this year we've seen cash balances among US equity neutral funds raspberry sharply we've seen hedge funds reduce their leverage I think that's the appropriate positioning to take when the fed is pushing down equities tightening financial conditions and of course the economy is slowing Where investors are hedging the risk that the market goes higher are unusually expensive so that is a major theme it's something we're talking to clients about but at the end of the day what drives We think there's effectively a ceiling on how high the equity market can go because a major equity market rally with loosen financial conditions You pretty antithetical to what the fed is trying to achieve today.

That being said, you know, I think that cryptocurrency is due tint to lead other risk assets and that they trade 24/7/. So, some people are actually looking at some analysts I've spoken to as as Babies sort of a leading and indicator that October might look better for crypto acids and potentially higher risk stocks.

Of course, the trademark bike Bike Plus and the tread but with all of that in mind you said that product is undifferentiated and too expensive so even if they do have these new partnerships only commerce front how do they eventually start to get into new homes or just get more subscribers it sounds like though you you believe that this Just going to oh. They're not going to be able to do that You gotta start with the unit economics. First, they have to produce a product that actually generates a profit and they're not doing that. So, whether or not they sell that over their website, Amazon's website, or in Dick's Sporting Good Stores, sort of doesn't matter how much you sell a product that Actually generate a profit.

Yeah I know they're absolutely gonna need more cash I mean they're burning at an alarming clip and look the bottom one on content is that it's it's expensive to produce I mean just look at the troubles that Netflix has had right people don't realize that Netflix is a terribly cash flow negative business because they capitalize all those content costs yeah content is not cheap go to original Content is expensive. So, that's not gonna save the business. And you gotta keep in mind that margins right now profit margins are negative 30%.

Like any other vaccine it's an education for the body and the other approach I write about the identical virus approach that led to the J and J as well as the AstraZeneca vaccines tats are really interesting one two that one also took years in making and I read about how the how that began really with HIV effort to to salvage we haven't Figure that one out yet but they shifted these scientists and said, okay, we can't do HIV but we're gonna get a vaccine for COVID.

What's happening in the UK the difference being is that printing money when I'm when inflation was two% is one thing printing money when it's eight and a half percent creates a whole lot more problems so I think we could see the financing problems that we saw in 2019 potentially without the fed riding to the rescue So Michael obviously we're still expecting this period of volatility to last until the third is ready to pivot or change direction in terms of if you have a short term investment horizon A longer one.

The other key driver of course is earnings and here too we think estimates are getting close to where they need to be. We've seen some pretty clear In the last several months we still think there's a little bit more downward moves likely to come but we think consensus earnings estimates are getting close to where they should be 3600 that is our newly revised year end target for this year so we think the market is pretty close to fair value Positioning in flows. And over you've seen a very very sharp D rating in markets this year and accordingly we've seen a very sharp degree of selling from our institutional investor clients this is appropriate in our view but also raises the risk that if we get some data in the next couple months that is slightly better than expected we could see a pretty sharp rebound especially as ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZtRLAJ6j4,35,2022-10-03 16:20:37

Just said don't worry about the next few weeks or what's happening from here until the end of the year but I'm gonna ask you about that because so many investors are closely watching what the fed is doing I know you said that you think the fed should pause it's a rate it should pause it's rate hikes when do you expect though the fed to pivot Well I I I wouldn't be surprised if it the November meeting they they do a raid hike that's far less than the 75 they've been doing they could do maybe 25 and 50 and I think they might take a pause after that I mean to me we're at the point where we we've had to meet sufficient tightening Rachel in the pipeline since March of 2021 we've had a tremendous drop in the money supply growth rate from 27% down to basically 4 year% on year fiscal juice was 18 and a half percent GDP back in March of 2021.

2476,One typically without a mask inflation the thing that really makes a recession much worse is that you go into it with generally sky high confidence and then you destroy confidence on main street which lengthens in deepens the recession we won't do that here because confidence is already been destroyed we're heading into a Down with confidence starting to revive which will buffer us against it a contraction overall. The other thing is if animal spirits start to revive here that's gonna run right through main street economy and also help the stock market Continuing to rise now as we look forward.

2477,"The more than five% and look at chevron as well almost six% as we see them really making gains here ahead of the Opec plus meeting in Vienna on Wednesday so here to break down what the meeting could mean for oil prices is Greg share now Pimco Portfolio manager and head of commodities so these gains that we're seeing right now we have some analysts saying look we could be looking at potentially $100 a bar soon. Do you think the same? Yeah, I think there is upside to oil right now. What is remarkable that we're talking about opac curtailing production at a time where the inventories globally are at the lower end of the historical range and you're looking at it in the market which is highly back related which is a state where the prompt prices Bob deferred prices which is typical when a market is tight and there's and consumers are willing to pay a premium for immediate delivery. If you look at the carry in the oil market succeeding 15% which is on the operator of historical range to think that Opec is taking this as a time to cut is really without historical president and if they do so, they're gonna To keep the inventories low. Which will keep upward prices. There are likely doing this to one preempt any potential demand slowdown. But also in my mind they're doing it to reflect the fact That their spare capacity is towards the bottom of historical range. It's sort of like driving a car with your foot pressed down all the way to the metal and you're starting to get feedback and vibrations in this system and I think as a result, they wanna move off of their production that they're at right now. In order to create some spare capacity in the system and create some flexibility, should there be addition Down the road. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZtRLAJ6j4,76,2022-10-03 19:20:17
2478,"But also can lead to potentially lower oil prices in the process because it'll take some of the pressure out of the system that we have seen We're gonna what do you think of this debate overpriced caps or not? I guess how effective are they typically or do you think they would potentially be? So it's being sold right now when you're talking about oil specifically As an attempt to get around European sanctions do you agree to a price cap we'll wave some of these sanctions on an unshipping and insurance and hopefully that will grease the wheels but that is not ultimately how the market should function and I think the price cap could likely backfire in part because Russia holds a say and how much they're willing to sell and to who and at what price? And Nate and we've seen small reductions and export volumes could have outside impact and prices particularly when the market is tight. Now, in Europe, the problem is it sends the wrong incentives to the consumers. Particularly if there's some That aren't capped they will have a higher burden just to bear if the market is tight so for example if you're gonna cap residential commercial industrial end users will have ultimately higher prices to manage through the the demand rational that needs to happen Surprise caps are really not the ultimate solution Than they're hoping for.

When it comes to use market what do we learn from car max when they got hit sales were down six and a half percent they're CEO saying the consumer look to be hit by affordability what do we learn there? Well, I think, you know, used car buyers are gonna be much more price sensitive, okay? Use car buyers. They're not gonna be in the wealthy. They're not gonna be the ones buying the Corvettes and the Broncos and the Gladiators because they've got plenty of money. So, they're kinda the early indicator here and if they're falling off because they're not gonna invest in a new car now, they've decided to hold off on a big purchase. Global economy in general Horizon. So call when we look at things like affordability what consumers are willing to spend on is there a sweet spot right now in terms of the kinds of models that consumers want to buy? You know, they've always wanted flexibility and that's why SUVs become so popular over the last 10 plus years. It's the idea that one car conserves so many different purposes. So, you're still gonna always have that that SUV flexibility be one of the focuses of consumer demand and that's why so many car companies have switched Generally toward SUVs versus cars but it also means that if you're able to buy without getting an SUV if you can get by with the Sudan You get a much better price versus an SUV which everyone wants.

So again, that's the that's kind of the like profile. The next 6 months gonna be very clear Clearer not very clear you know we've been talking a lot about jobs I'm curious to ask you about housing yeah because we talk about housing a lot and how much mortgage rates have gone up and how it's there it's a problem of affordability but when you talk about it as an Driver how concerned are you about housing? Well, that is an interest rate sensitive sector so when the fed tightens or any central bank titans, it's not uniform across the economy. You're gonna look at the interest rate sensitive sectors and they should be feeling the pain first. That's housing durable goods etcetera. So, the housing starts we have a couple of funny prints recently but that should be Going down, housing demand should be slowing down as the prices should be leveling off but again, you're looking for an narrative that's gonna deceleration rather than tanking but do you know the mortgage rates are pushing seven% right now, right? Not too long ago, they were three and some of us luckily locked in lower than that but that's that's a big affordability issue. So, that should be, you know, breaking the economy But again, if people have jobs, they think they're gonna keep their jobs. They're gonna continue to spend. The moderate they're spending for, you know, lower acid prices or you know, bit higher inflation but that's the sector. One of the sectors that's on the short list. Yeah. If we start to see that really go pear shape, then Might be in the recession scenario rather than the slowdown scenario. So, we have housing prices coming into wraps. We have consumers worried about even rising interest rates and we have the market's terrible year for the markets. Many parts of it. How does this impact consumer spending into 2023?

If that's not coming down meaningfully after Sort of nice scenario we're talking about and then we get your down like Julie but I think that's not a baseline right now. Oh nope. Another contributor to that the inflationary pressures that we have seen has been energy costs as well and even as we think about what a US recession may look like, there's also what we were discussing earlier in the show in And some of the cutting and some of their production. What that may mean in Europe but also how much the European or a global recession more broadly may also trickle into the US economy. Yeah, I mean, energy, oil prices are in the 80s right On Opec's gonna talking that looks like strategically they might wanna kinda keep them in that zone but energy prices are down quite a bit right so going around town there were five handles on gas not too long ago an hour in the three so that That's source of inflation has come down the supply chain source of inflation has come down food still a bit elevated but if we put all that in sort of a non-core bucket that part of the inflation is pulling down the headline numbers but the We just talked about 2 minutes ago which is the core is still going up. So, that's gonna help. If that helps drag down the other stuff, that's good but you know, we still have a core inflation problem in this country and a lot of other countries and that's what Central Banks have to look at Other stuff is great for the headline but they're really focused on the the core.

If you look at the carry in the oil market succeeding 15% which is on the operator of historical range. To think that Opec is taking this is a time To cut is really without historical president and if they do so they're gonna continue to keep the inventories low which will keep upward prices they're largely doing this to one preempt any potential demand slow down but also in my mind they're doing it to reflect the fact That their spare capacity is towards the bottom of historical range. It's sort of like driving a car with your foot pressed down all the way to the metal and you're starting to get feedback and vibrations in this system.

I guess how effective are they typically or do you think they would potentially be? So it's being sold right now when you're talking about oil specifically. As an attempt to get around European sanctions do you agree to a price cap we'll wave some of these sanctions on shipping and insurance and hopefully that will grease the wheels but that is not ultimately how the market should function and I think the price cap could likely backfire in part because Russia holds to say and how much they're willing to sell and to who and at what price? And Nate and we've seen small reductions in export volumes could have outside Particularly when the market is tight. Now, in Europe, Album is it sends the wrong incentives to the consumers Particularly if there's some That aren't capped. They will have a higher burden to to bear if the market is tight. So, for example, if you're gonna cap residential, commercial, industrial end users, we'll have ultimately higher prices to manage through The demand ration that needs to happen so price caps are really not the ultimate solution That's gonna rebalance the market and unfortunately it could lead to more volatility and then they're hoping for it.

Michael highly recommend you check out some of the memes and gifs of those millions of people waiting to play. Twitter is entertaining right now as far as overwatch too but I think you answer my question there about Future of this activism merger Microsoft acquisition. They they launched a website yesterday just basically to PR the acquisition and what it does for the gaming community. That's not generally a good sign. Why is this taking so long and when do you think it gets approved? It warms my heart that you say jiff which is the correct way to say it by the way. No, it's taking so long because the the government Starting to actually do its job and I think, you know, we had 4 years where where government agencies got out of the way and let businesses do whatever they how they wanted. We now have a different administration. I think the FTC is watching out for the consumer and making sure that if a combination goes through that it doesn't result in a lowering Competition.

I think that tech companies suffer from the delusion that if they're good at one thing they can be good at everything and so that's clearly that clearly was Google's problem that's clearly Netflix is problem In 2001 they they did a little better with the Xbox 360 in 2005 and then a lot better you know the Xbox one and the Xbox series X but they they figured out that they need to really own Content to be good and it took them literally 15 years to have great content and that then they wanna Netflix isn't going to do it by building one game at a time and they're not gonna do it by buying little tiny, you know, mobile game developers. Anybody who wants to be in this business is gonna have to make a splash. So, the answer to your question is Yes consolidation is likely if a big tech company decides they wanna be in this I don't think Netflix has the assets or the appetite to go spend you know 6070 one 1 billion dollars Amazon maybe but they you know they're they're pissing money down a whole trying to build games themselves and they're doing a really Job at it.

Also, there were some discussion with his brother, Kimball Musk saying that there was this blockchain idea that there would be a paid a tweet so that it would be recorded much later than goes back, walks out back and say, no, that's not gonna really be possible because of And see issues that the platform has to chug along much quicker than that from a programming standpoint also for those concerned that to Dan's point that there would be not enough speech moderation musk on April 28 said this to an investor Michael Kive's he said Twitter is obviously not going to be turned into some right wing nut house aiming to be Oddly inclusive as possible. Do the right thing for the vast amount of majority of Americans. So, he is saying that he does realize that content moderation has to happen Really quickly down the timing of this obviously weeks before that court case was set to begin but also just about a month out from the midterms.

That's gonna put a little bit of a crimp in the people who are looking for a fed plaza or a fed pivot. It gives us likely to drive inflation at least stabilize inflation to higher level There is another catalyst looming in December when you've got those sanctions on Russian oil taking effect obviously these headlines coming out of G seven countries saying they maybe they wanna try and phase that in to to try in limits Impact to the markets overall but how much of that has actually already been priced in, you think? Well, I think a decent amount of it again. I was short crude oil prior to the leaks of opac potentially cutting by a one 1 million. My prediction was there were going to cut by a one 1 million a half and be able to sort of go out of the public and say we're actually trying to help our allies as best we can by not cutting two 1 million barrels. It didn't do that. They went ahead with My own barrel. So, from a perspective of what's going on with the future output of production. They've already been missing their current production quota. So, there's two 1 million barrel cuts really only gonna be about 800 1000 to a one 1 million if they actually were to reach maximum here So, the length of it is disturbing to me. The length of time that they're going to do this because this means that it can do and they're they've announced they're gonna have meetings every other month now. Which prior to that, they said that they would be at a need to know basis. Every other month means they can adjust as both up or down and it seems like they're target is more to Production now.

Production certainly key when you consider how depleted SPR already is. You know, there's a political backdrop to all this which is of course that trip the president made to Saudi Arabia over the summer. You know, we saw in the bath aftermath of that Opec Plus just increasing production just slightly but now you've got this What is considered you know more than expected two 1 million barrels a day production cut what does that mean in terms of the US relationship with the Saudi's well it's obviously iceier than it used to be and let's let's not forget that this goes back to the murder of the journalist Kamal Kashoji Jamalka Shoji a few years ago Turkey a perpetrated by the Saudi regime so Biden described the Saudi government and their leader Muhammad Bidzelman as a state in when he was running for That obviously reflected deteriorating relations and then he had to go over there kind of kind of taking it back and saying could you please release a little more oil they basically Said no. So, you know, there's a there's a lot this market is huge and very dynamic and you're one of the things that has gotten the Saudi's attention is increased production in the United States. The United States is still the world's largest producer of oil. It became the first largest producer a couple of years ago and it still is. But the government here doesn't control the oil sector. That's a big difference. So, the government here can't say pump more, pump less. That's up to the private sector and all the incentives there. So, very dynamic market.

Well I think there's a number of things starting with Opec Plus concerned about the world going into a recession which impart was caused by high energy prices earlier this year when we saw crude oil places rallied in between 130 and $140 a barrel as well as the high natural Industrial output so I think they wanted to take a preemptive step to reduce production in light of declining demand Higher inflation rates eating into their budgets.

2676,"They have all the money they need in terms of deposits. The banks that do compete aggressively are the smaller institutions. So, it's not the one that has a branch on every corner, not the one that has its name on the stadium, but smaller institutions, we see rates as high as 301%. Now Institutions like dollar savings direct UFB direct these are completely federally insured so I say move your money over to these and get that risk free return No a lot of people obviously more comes through with some of these bigger bags that they recognize but as you mentioned, they're not seeing the returns. How important is it to shop around at the moment? It's really important because there is an arms race going on at the high end of the savings market. By the way, I think these rates are even more attractive than CDs because they're liquid. You could get three. Six% on a 1 year CD but you could get 301. On a totally liquid, federally insured, Savings account and these rates could continue to go higher too because banks do compete but you're not gonna get anything pretty much by just sitting in the big bank. The average there is 014. So, what you wanna do is shop around, look for federal insurance, and look to tie this to your checking account. I think that's a good You may keep the big bank checking account for ATM access and other things. Link it to a savings account. Park your emergency savings there. You could get at least a few $100 a year. You know, if you save $10 thousand over the course of the year at three%, that's 300 bucks.

And I also wanna ask you about some of these credit card balances and loans and things that people are starting to take out as they now are dipping more into their savings than ever as inflation starts to bite. What should people be aware of? And what are you tracking when it comes to things like credit content? The average credit card rate is about 18 and a half percent now that's the highest in 30 years balances have been going up as well According to the New York Fed as of Q two they were four percentage points below that all time high which was set in late 2019 but they did take up 13% from Qtwo of last year to queue to of this year we're gonna get the queue three data soon I think that could well show a record but this is another one of those kind Counterintuitive things that despite the highest rates in 30 years despite what could soon be an all-time record for credit card balances delinquencies remain very low the debt to income ratio remains very low The industry is thinking about this in terms of normalization. You know, yeah, these delinquencies are gonna go up but so far the the thinking is that it won't be in a worry some sense. It'll be maybe back to 2019 levels. The strong job market definitely helps.

2682," in some cases they're just absolutely shocking but you know of course it was almost a week ago we got that car max report and and the stock was absolutely. So I just don't want folks to forget about that because we're going into earnings season coming up we're going to get results from a car vano in an automation in that car max report I think was very disturbing so let's pull some stats here and we're getting a lot of weakness in the used car market and a lot of this data comes from manheim. Noting that wholesale used vehicle prices fell 2.3 per cent per cent per cent from August in the first 15 days of September so prices are really starting to to come down here as I think a lot of would be buyers are blocking it some of the interest rates are getting on these loans in many cases above a seven percent price declines according to the manheim index the steepest in full size and sports car in sports cars some of the higher so some of the higher priced offerings here and we have that manheim chart two now of course we saw a big spike and used car vehicle prices at a lot of the market and we saw a big spike and used car vehicle prices at around the pandemic is everybody needed a car they wanted a car they were out there traveling more they were doing stacations or just staying home now they've also then they also when they start to return to the office they went out there and bought cars they don't want to take public transportation but now all those dynamics I would argue are no longer in play at the extent they were we're now we're seeing prices come down alongside of a slowing economy now the losers from the slow down in the use vehicle market or of course car max where there's very ugly report auto nation is pretty much the same as car max in terms of business model carvana the online focused retailer of used vehicles and then you have a hurts and a Davis now why did I include them in here because you know a lot of times their stocks trade off the perceived value of the inventory or the car inventory that hurts in in avis own so those car prices are coming down that's less of a valuation or less value assigned to the hurts and avis budget rental fleets or their inventories over a good quote here so I'll just add to from Adam Jonas Morgan Stanley noting car max might be first on and feeling the impact of the use car decline but we expect the entire retail auto retail franchise and auto credit complex to follow so something to keep in mind from Adam my take is this auto retail stocks are probably dead money for right now I know if you're happy there I'm getting ready to go out for crews my sunglasses on but still it's going to be hard to find positive catalyst for some of these names in the coming months. You know it's really interesting on especially the use car side when we think about the rental parts of that business that you mentioned to I almost bought my first car from enterprise actually because I had known and there are a lot of people out there that take advantage of this after they do find out that it hurts that a avis that an enterprise that they actually do sell used cars because sometimes they're just trying to work through old inventory that they have in order to get newer vehicles that are going to be able to be rented out and have better maintenance cycles over a longer period of time knowing how many times those keys are changing hands to. Did you buy it? I didn't know. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I was about to have like throw out 300,000. They have a lot of models.

2683," oke October already shaping up to be a volatile month after the S&P 500 posted its worst monthly return since March 2020 in September. Our next guest says any future rallies in the market will be muted. She says, let's bring you BlackRock America's eye shares investment, a strategy head, Gargie Chaudry, Gargie, it's good to see you. Fade those rallies, you say. Why should folks be thinking that way? Good morning, Julie. Good to be here. So I think that a few times we've seen this deal already that the market has prepositioned for a Fed pivot. And what we've learned over and over again from the various Fed because that has spoken this week and previously is that they're not quite ready to do that yet. So to the extent that we're not getting a fully dovish pivot from the Fed, I think any time that the equity market rallies like it did the first two days of October with those two massive moves that we hadn't seen since April 2020, every time we see moves like this, I think we're supposed to fade them. Now look, I'll say that you're still supposed to be invested in certain corners of the equity market. But broadly, I think that there will still be some more volatility and pain ahead, especially as we continue to see the data slow down and perhaps even grapple with the recession. Would you believe prompted some of the early quarter rally that we'd seen? Yeah, I think that some of that was just positioning. I think a lot of people, as you guys know and talk about often, became really bearish. So there was that crazy price action, I would say. And some of that was just positioning. So a rally based on just the short positioning out there. Some of it was like I had said earlier that this expectation or this view that the Fed would pivot, think back to two months ago where we did see one soft CPI print and we saw a huge amount of rally in the equity markets on the back of that. Then of course, last month, we saw a very strong CPI print and we gave back a lot of that rally. So I think this back and forth between the direction of rate and between the direction or the estimation of a pivot from the Fed is going to drive equity markets in the future. And I still believe that we are going to continue to see a little bit of slowing down. I mean, earnings growth will have to slow from here. And I think that's still going to play out in the equity market. So stay invested. Be in minimum volatility, be in energy equities, be in healthcare. But broadly, is this rally going to persist? I don't think so. And Gargi, we just are hearing from Neil Cash.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,2,2022-10-06 13:57:57
2684," be an energy equities, be in healthcare. But broadly, is this rally going to persist? I don't think so. And Gargi, we just are hearing from Yelp Keshkari who's participating in a Q&A. The head one that caught my eye sort of echoes what you've been talking about. He said the bar to shifting our stance on policy is very high. You know, it sort of emphasizes, right? Don't get ahead of yourself folks and look for the pivot. If their bar is very high to shifting their stance, what are you looking for for them to go over that bar? What signals are you looking for from the economic data that actually would cause maybe, okay, let's not even say a pivot, even a pause or a slow down in their strategy. Sure thing, Julie. I think that's the most important question. And I think the Fed has tried to be transparent about it. So they will need to see, or their expectations of inflation will need to come down. They will need to see a few months of data where inflation is decelerating, not accelerating, and moving closer to that target of 2% on 4 BCE. We haven't seen that yet. And again, one number does not print things. So it will have to be a more of a three or four prints of decelerating inflation, certainly on the core inflation. So that's number one. Another way in which I think we could, so that's the most important. But secondly, I think that the Fed could pause, again, not pivot, maybe just stay, stay with it, if you will. I think they would, if they started to see a significant slowing in the labor market. And that's something that the Fed has made very clear that they want to see the labor market slow down. Now, if we see a couple of months of maybe a hundred thousand prints on the payroll, I think that's possible that we can hear the Fed talking about a slow-up out of policy or a pause in the months ahead. But again, it's not one month. It's a few months. And then finally, I think we did, obviously learn a lot from the Bank of England. We are not in the same position as the UK at all, they're different dynamics in the market. But I will say that if there is any kind of market functioning questions that arise in the US, and again, we're not there now. But if that does happen in 2023, I think that could be a way in which the Fed indicates to us that they will not be raising rates in a significant manner, or at least that the bar has come down. Gary, we're coming up against two interesting market moving events. We have the Fed meeting November 2nd, and then a couple of days later, we have the midterm election. So let's say this, let's say the Fed comes out here, reiterates their hawkish tone. We get that out of the way. Next day, after the elections we learn, we're going to have divided government. What happens to the stock market in your view into your end? I think it's going to be very difficult for the stock market to have the rallies that we saw in the first two days of October in that situation. Now look, a lot of things will drive the stock market. I don't want to base it entirely upon the Fed and elections only. Obviously, we have a blockbuster earnings season. That's something that will obviously be a big driver of the market. But all of a sequel, if you're just giving me a hawkish Fed and a divided government, I think it's just going to be really hard for the equity market to make new highs or to get back to levels that we had seen perhaps in the second quarter of this year with that framework. I think we really need to see a fundamental shift in the earnings picture where earnings growth is very healthy across all sectors. And I just don't see how that happens when we have an economy that is slowing down because the Fed wants it to. All right, thanks, Gargie. Good to catch up with you. BlackRock America's I-Share's investment strategy head, Gargie Chaudry. Thanks so much. Coming up, the recent surge in mortgage rates is causing Americans to rethink, home buying, will the rates stay at these levels? We actually have a little bit of relief, maybe.

2685," is Welcome back to Y'all of Finance. I'm Brian Saazi here with Julie Heimann and Brad Smith markets are tiptoeing into Friday's crucial jobs report. It's seen some mixed action across the board amongst the major indices but for right now at this particular moment in time, all three major indices in the red. Julie over to you with some breaking news on a market. You follow very closely that is mortgage rates. Well now I do like everyone 6.6% 6.66% is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac that information just coming out. It is a very very slight improvement over the 6.7% that we talked about last week as Freddie Mac's chief economist points out rates remain quite high compared to just one year ago. Meaning housing continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers. This is something that we have talked a lot about the real world implications of having these higher mortgage rates that are more than double where they were a year ago. The people are just going to pay a lot more over the life of the mortgage. It also means by the way that housing prices are starting to come down as a result because if someone is paying overall more for financing the house then what's got to give in many cases it's the home prices and the demand that we have seen also has been falling to some extent. Yeah, it continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers here. Freddie Mac also noting that they're going to make some enhancements to their market survey really improving and looking at some of the collection quality diversity of data use. It seems like kind of mirroring what we had seen from ADP earlier. This year over the summer this is a time to really get a better sense of how accurate the data still is and still as of right now for some of these rates it does still point to what we all expected and still some home buyers are experiencing is the higher rates that they're having to pay for an extended period of time which is kind of barring out. And it's just the average if your credit isn't up to snuff right. You're paying way more than this. Maybe last year at this point if your credit wasn't good what maybe you pay five or six percent now what do you eight nine ten. One thing to point out is people do refinance. They're mortgages right. So if rates do if you buy a house at this rate and then rates go down then you can many people can then refinance. So that is one little.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,4,2022-10-06 14:06:50
2686," So if you buy a house at this rate and then rates go down, then many people can then refinance. So that is one little more positive tone here. All right, let's talk about the implications of all of this and the implications of higher rates on the economy overall. For that we bring in Kenneth Rogoff. He is Professor of Economics at Harvard University. He's joining us now, Ken. Thank you so much for being here, first of all. Here is sort of a very visible real world impact of Fed policy, right? The rate increase that we have seen in mortgages specifically and the effect that the knock on effect that has on the housing market. What do you think overall about the effectiveness of Fed policy with fighting this current bout of inflation? Well, we haven't had them fight about of inflation in a very long time. So whatever models we had, we have to dust off and see. I think we know that their long lack of facts, yeah, it hits the markets very quickly. It's equity markets, more slowly, housing markets, but things like employment, the peak effects can be a year off. So it's very hard. It's one of the things that makes it so hard for the Fed to get to a soft or soft-ish landing, which I'm pretty skeptical about. Okay, and so with your skepticism about getting to a soft-ish landing, what would the reality of the economic detriment incurred be if we were to see what many economists are calling for a recession in mid-2023? Well, I mean, I think it could be pretty brutal if the Fed really is hell-bent on having inflation come down as quickly as possible to two or two and a half percent. We have Europe very likely going to recession China. It leads to growth recession by all measures for the Amor recession. That's a lot of pressures on us, the dollar is very strong. And interest rates are rising very fast. So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession if that would be lucky. I'd say it could be a tough trade-off for the Fed once the numbers start setting in. I'm a little worried that having gone the wrong way in one direction with the change in their framework and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation, they're now going in the other direction and possibly moving too fast given the long legs. Professor, if the economy does get brutal, like you just suggested, do you think this is a Federal Reserve at some point next year that is back to unwinding these aggressive rate hikes they've been taking recently? So here's the thing. Yes, but I think where we're going to land at the end of this and now I'm looking maybe two years ahead is that a level of interest rates higher than we're used to even after inflation comes down. The real interest rate, the premium of the interest rate over the inflation rates, been extraordinarily low since the financial crisis. Some people say it's secular stagnation, demographic, low productivity inequality, what have you. I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact it was abnormally low in that period and we're going to get some moving back to being meaning that interest rates even when they start coming down, they not come down all that much. So how do we then determine what the sort of natural or stable rate should be, right? Is there any way of sort of gaming that out what that could look like? Very tough. My own research sort of speaks to the 10-year rate which I think will end up in a higher place than we've been used to before the pandemic. But what's going on with the Fed funds rate with all the regulation and the financial repression is a little hard to say. So they really have no idea that's one of the things that's making it difficult. But if you're asking, I think it'll be higher than we're used to. For consumers right now, what should they be navigating? How can they best navigate perhaps even leading into the scenario that you've described? I mean, it's a tough picture. We're probably...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,5,2022-10-06 14:10:44
2687," perhaps even leading into the scenario that you've described. Well, I mean, it's a tough picture where probably headed towards a, you know, difficult situation coming out of a difficult situation. Certainly, I think employment is the key. Everybody's been particularly young people can moving jobs, you know, every six months or a year. They better think twice about that in this period when it might not be so easy to land on another job. Can I want to switch gears a little bit because you focus not just on the US, but on the globe as well. And you and some others are just out with some really interesting research on the real estate market in China. Now, so much, there's been so much attention on the sort of zero COVID policy and the negative effect that's having on China. But there's some underlying risk here that you illustrate in this research. We're looking now, you look at so-called tier three Chinese cities, some of the smaller cities, although still pretty large, and that there's this excessive housing stock and that there's been really a sharp slowdown in prices and housing prices in those areas. What kind of risk is this presenting for the Chinese economy? Well, I think it's a huge long-term problem with or without the zero COVID policy. Housing, real estate, more generally, commercial real estate infrastructure has been the go-to policy for China. I did some research a couple of years ago, peak China housing, showing all the factors that suggested we really have come to an end of it. And more recently, my co-author and I've shown that a lot of that is concentrated in the more hidden tier three cities, the Cincinnati's of China, so to speak. But they out, let me say the Cincinnati's of China could be five and ten million people, maybe since the United States of few hundred thousand, and on top of that, there are a lot of them. They account for 60% of GDP. You don't see it that people travel to the big cities, they're less visible, but they have, they really have a problem where they've been building like crazy and are sort of getting to the end of the line of that development strategy, and it's not that easy for them to pivot. And so what then happens when we do see China coming out of zero COVID, at the same time that the rest of the globe is slowing down or even entering recession. I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe? China's been enormously important for the rest of the globe. It's counted for, I don't know, like a quarter of all global growth over the decade before the pandemic may be going into the first year, at least according to the IMF, and those days are over. I think we're looking at much slower growth in China, who knows what the real numbers are, but much slower growth in China for years to come. And of course, it matters. I mean, it hits commodity exporters, the hardest, that they have a raracious appetite for commodities, but European luxury car makers, et cetera. I think it's going to have a very big effect. And that's even without the Ukraine war and whatever happens there and which side China ends up on. Can we go off, Professor of Economics at Harvard University. Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations, all of it, great conversation. Guys, let's get to the Iowa finances and that's for over at the Wi-Fi Interactive with a look at what's taking place here on the day and that is what we're tracking. And you guys were just talking about those markets, right? And just looking at the home builders, we did see a little bit of action here with some of these home builders that had been in green territory. Now losing some of that steam, I just want to also pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see how much these home builders have lost year-to-date. Looking at the sector action, we are seeing the markets down right now, so you're looking at utilities and also real estate, which are moving to the downside. You've got energy, though, that is still in green territory. And over on the NASDAQ 100, some of these mega caps that had been in green earlier are now a bit under pressure in video had been more than 1% earlier now losing some steam. Also looking at some of what's happening with our trending tickers because we've got two trending tickers that we should mention on our trending ticker page.

That is putting pressure on stocks. And on those trending, we are seeing Pinterest that's trending right now. Number one on our Yahoo Finance page. That's after that Goldman call. But also want to check out Costco because Costco's September sales came in higher than expected. So you're looking at those sales that increasing for Costco. And the stock right now up more than 1% year to date also outperforming the broader markets because that's chewy. But you're today Costco down 14% still outperforming the broader markets. You can tell consumers still want to get value big bulk. They love Costco. I love those hot dogs and as for a thanks for saving me to appreciate it because we're here before we had to break. You saw on that board, a nice highlight of chewy. Let's put a spotlight on the impressive wheat so far for shares of chewy. Sock is up close to 20% on the week. We're seeing it add to gains a little bit here on the early going. Dusting the Nasdaq Composites 5.5% gain. The online pet retailer, Stock, got a big boost on Wednesday, especially into the close as data from investment research out that Yippet found chewy sales trending above expectations for the current quarter. We will note that chewy in late August slashes full of your sales outlook by a couple hundred million dollars in stock. Got absolutely clobbered. Coming up. Sorry, I was just going to say I just bought some handouts. It's really so good. Amazon versus chewy. Alright, let's take that discussion off on a very interesting topic. Alright, coming up.

2689," Let's get down to business now with some other headlines we're watching. Uber's former security chief Joseph Sullivan has been found guilty of obstructing an FTC probe for failing to report a 2016 data breach to authorities. Prosecutor said he took steps to cover up the incident, classifying the hack as a bug bounty rather than a data breach. Sullivan's legal team said that after the hacker signed non-disclosure agreements, the security chief felt the incident did not need to be reported. The Sullivan now faces a five-year prison sentence for obstruction, and up to three years for failing to report a felony. That data breach, by the way, occurred during Travis Kalinick's term as CEO, where top performers were often given a blind eye. Meanwhile, General Electric is restructuring the company laying off workers at his offshore wind unit as it grapples with weak demand, rising costs, and supply chain delays according to reports. The cuts are expected to affect 20% of the offshore wind unit's US workforce, which equates to hundreds of workers. Wind has been GE's largest and most profitable renewable business, but the expiry of renewable energy tax credits took a big toll on demand. And Ford is raising the price again for its electric F-150 lightning pickup truck. The second time in the last couple months, the chief is versioned. Now retails were just under $52,000, that's a roughly 30% increase from the original starting price of about $40,000 with first-win on sale in May. Ford said in his statement, the increase is on the result of ongoing supply chain constraints, rising material costs, and other market factors. So as. Fitter shares continue to trade below Elon Musk's $54.20 offer price, as there is still fears on a deal getting done. Let's get more on this with City's Senior Alistair, Ron Josie, Ron. Good to see you here, just based on your knowledge of the situation, folks, you have talked to, do you still think this deal gets done at that price? You know, we were pretty, the big news this week was around coming together, both parties suggesting with Elon saying we will honor our original $54.20 share offer and Twitter come out, coming out specifically and saying that it's something that we are looking to do as well. So the fact that they are both negotiating table, not in court going against each other, I think that's a positive step. And it seems to me, it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be made to Twitter and when that would actually take place, even if and as this does kind of continue to work its way through? Yeah, I mean, if something were to happen, meaning that if it is acquired by Mr. Musk and if we go through and it's a now private company, look, unfortunately this has been in the public world now that this acquisition back in force and call it March or April, I believe, with the initial deal initial offer there. And so Twitter has gone through quite a bit of change from then until now, not only from a business perspective with advertisers potentially pulling back, maybe getting a little bit more nervous, some placing ads on Twitter, in addition to the macro changes that are happening out there, but then internally, there's just a lot of concern in our view around morale, around basically attrition or just getting things done in new products being launched. So your question of how long would it take to sort of get the business back up to speed? Frankly, it would take probably some time to rebuild and the macro environment would not help in the current environment where advertising continues to be a little bit of a software subject overall. And Ron, we don't even know what he's going to do with the company, right? I have to say, man, it must be tough analyzing this company right now. You didn't know if the deal was going to get done. You don't know what Elon's going to do if he does indeed consummate the deal, right? I mean, we've gotten some hints dropped. There's been a lot of speculation. Trump's going to come back. He's talked about this, everything app X, whatever. But like, how do you, how do you even model concretely in a situation like this? Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company. So you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself to model and figure out what's next. But you essentially have to rebuild the business, right? So you start, I'm sure the first my order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the same thing. If your business is veryать that you will be able to live in depressed memories. See, you continue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,8,2022-10-06 14:24:12
2690," So you start, I'm sure the first my order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the service onboarding with something that was a big focus prior to this saga that we're incurring currently. And so number one would be product. Number two then is figuring out how you best monetize. And right now the model is primarily advertising. But of course, there's options around subscription. There's options around maybe payments or something along those lines purchases. So there's different things you can do. But I think day one, whenever this comes to a conclusion has to be let's focus on the product. Let's make sure it becomes that, call it town square, open free marketplace, and then everything else should follow. But it's not something that I think happens overnight. It's likely to take some time. Ron, is there an appetite in the marketplace for this super app concept that Elon is pushing here? Do consumers want to, let's say, go into Twitter, tweet, then also maybe get taken to trade some stocks on XYZ platform, and then order an Uber, and then a hamburger for dinner. I mean, do people really want that? Yeah, it's interesting. The super apps here in the West haven't really taken on as much as they have, taken off as much as they have over in Asia and other parts of the world. And so that definitely is a TBD overall. Partnerships to allow things along those lines that would build off of what you see on Twitter make sense. You can see that happening. But one super app, it's a change in use case, right? And the thing with Twitter that haven't covered the company for a while now, and looking at it quarter in, quarter out, the number one thing is a product, be those monetizable daily active users. And so the more you can do to get those users on board, everybody knows Twitter. What's always surprising is you would think it would have a bigger footprint overall. And so that's the in terms of users. And so that's probably the job number one. And if the super app does that, that's a big question. But frankly, it's still too early to even offer that. And I think you're right, it would have to be something that would at least be in line to what you are looking for and consuming while on Twitter. And there's partnerships that can make that happen. But it's definitely, I would say, the product is that that's on the roadmap for down the road. Once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all of the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes a media company? And I mean, a media company with partnerships that can actually charge people for the ability to watch video content, whether that be from the WMBA, whether that be live sports, or the partnerships with even some of the entertainment companies that they've worked with over the past, creating kind of a charging premise based on that, where the social connectivity just becomes an extra add-on on top of that. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do with the platform when you have as many monetized, well, DAUs that are out there. I would say, and we've always talked about the content on Twitter is amongst the best out there. And the content is really just an amalgamation of what people are saying and doing and tweeting and whatnot. And you can get lost in Twitter for hours, challenges, that product, providing those details on what you're looking for, going more in a media strategy, working with providers and partners. We've seen success in that, right? And I think Twitter in the past has had partnerships by providing videos and highlights from the Olympics, from the NFL, from many different sports teams, as well as award shows and whatnot. So I think going down the media path is something that would continue. The question is, the model changes from primarily advertising to maybe some sort of subscription that's a TBD. And I would say most entertainment companies on the web that have gone the paying for content, it's not an easy sort of chasm or bridge to cross. And so you really need to provide that value to get users to subscribe to it. And right now, again, Twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level. And that's really the key thing going forward, the personalization. Well, Ron, unfortunately, I think this is the first time we've talked to you about Twitter. Unfortunately, maybe it'll be the last if this still goes through. Although perhaps it'll be a relief for you. I don't know. I think we'll find some other good stuff.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,9,2022-10-06 14:28:21
2691," Fortunately, I think this is the first time we've talked to you about Twitter. And fortunately, maybe it'll be the last of this still goes through. Although perhaps it'll be a relief for you. I don't know. We'll find some other good stocks to talk about with you, though. Thanks so much for coming on. Cities, senior analysts, Ron, Josie. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me. Thanks. Coming up, Europe's natural gas crisis and focus as the E remains divided on how to tackle rising energy prices will have the latest on the other side. This morning, Swedish investigators confirmed suspicions of many saying that the recent leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to the EU were caused by detonations. Now they don't say who was responsible for those detonations, but nonetheless, they say the preliminary investigation has, quote, strengthened the suspicions of serious sabotage. Let's talk about the natural gas dynamics in that area and indeed around the globe. For that, we're joined by Goldman Sachs, head of natural gas research. That is Samantha Dart. Samantha, it's good to see you again. So we got this report this morning. I, again, it sort of confirms what a lot of folks had suspected. I don't know if it changes in your mind the calculation, the risks to supply knowing indeed that it was detonations that caused those leaks. It doesn't really. We already expected it. I think this is pretty much consensus that Nord Stream 1 or Nord Stream 2 for that matter would not flow gas to Nord Stream 2. Not only now, but going into next year as well. So our northwest shear and gas balance is remained the same. Okay. And so, I mean, for those of us who are still trying to admittedly wrap our heads around this fully, I mean, the price impact that this would have towards the end users, the end consumers of this natural gas as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,10,2022-10-06 14:32:12
2692," trying to admittedly wrap our heads around this fully. I mean, the price impact that this would have towards the end-users, the end-consumers of this natural gas as well. Yeah, so what the region is having to deal with is a massive lack of supply, right? This has been already established since the close from Russia have been curtailed and increasingly curtailed over the course of this year. As a result, we have seen prices skyrocket to 10 times or more of their 10-year average and we expect them to remain elevated going forward. Now sequentially, it's a bit tricky because over the course of the winter, actually if winter temperatures are close to average, we expect prices to drop a little bit and bring a little bit of relief because you have enough storage to deal with that deficit. Now going into next summer, yes, we still expect extremely elevated prices over 230 euros summer next year. Samantha, your colleagues over on the oil side of the equation raised their forecast for brand, I know. If oil prices start to trend back up higher, will we see an uptick in natural gas demand or is that demand just kind of firmly capped by the price action we've seen on that side? So you're right that under this surprisingly bullish op-ed cut that has been announced, the balance for oil looks even tighter and as our colleagues highlighted, you still have the risk of potentially a $30 per barrel spike to oil prices from here. Now even taking that into account, natural gas is still so expensive that it would continue to provide an incentive for users to substitute actually away from that, and into oil. So one interesting anecdote that we've been seeing, especially going into this winter, is that now this gas to oil substitution is not even just about the power generation sector, but it's also happening starting to happen in the industrial sector where some users, instead of buying incredibly expensive natural gas, they're opting for using oil in their boilers instead. Samantha, if we do in fact go into a more prolonged recession or economic slowdown, where do you see prices for natural gas going? So the interesting thing about this slowdown that we are seeing, especially in Europe, is that it's being caused by the lack of natural gas. So think about it this way. We don't have the normal supply of natural gas. So the only way to manage storage, the only way to guarantee that we're not going to face blackouts in the winter, is to curtail demand. So this is why prices have been so elevated. And as a result, yes, we're seeing aluminum producers cutting back, fertilizer producers, gas, I'm sorry, cement, glass refineries. So industrial activity is indeed slowing and bringing Europe into a recession because of the lack of natural gas. So this is what needs to happen until this deficit in gas is resolved. Goldman Sachs head of natural gas research, Samantha Dart, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Coming up, Guggenheim is calling this company its best idea into 2023. We'll break down a few analyst calls today. Don't go anywhere.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,11,2022-10-06 14:36:24
2693," The Now time for our call for the day. Despite Nike's inventory lows and margin pressure, Guggenheim is feeling good about the sneaker giant. The investment bank is maintaining its $135 price target and by rating on the Athlete's Leisure Maker calling it its best idea into 2023 or another way of looking best. They're saying, just do it. I'm so excited. But it's an amazing achievement. I'll try to bring this back. So interesting note by Guggenheim. I love Olympic fanat Robert Derbels work. He actually notes the top of this report that he's been covering the company for about 20 years. It feels like I've been following him for 20 years. But he does note that while profits are under pressure, he does still like Nike's brand equity. It likes its scale around the world. It likes its structural advantage in terms of its supply chain. And he goes on to say, again, some pretty cool charts that, yes, Brad, you wear Nike's? Not today. I saw the eyes move down. But Derbels also notes that we would note that Nike has a history of quick operating margin recovery from steep macro-driven drops. And we might be looking, I think investors might be looking for that to happen very, very soon. I'm wearing a brand today that was formerly owned by Nike. They divested from Cole Han. Not before making them really revolutionary, at least with the different souls that Cole Han would use in the lunar lawn from Nike. But again, I mean, this is really just kind of leaning into that brand equity that Nike has. And we were actually tossing around some of the stats that Julie was pulling earlier before the show, 22 out of the past 25 years. Nike has beat the S&P 500 performance here. And so you continue to think about what the brand has done over that time, whether it's some of the different acquisitions, making strategic decisions to get out of certain sports or at least equipment making in some sports. That's really led to the company being able to financially put those dollars that capital to work elsewhere. And the cultural partnerships that they've been able to make over time as well, they keep them in the spotlight. I just bought a new pair of sneakers. Yeah, which one? Did not buy Nike's. Really? I bought Sockinis. I tried on a pair of Nike. I tried on a pair of Sockinis. Good running shoe. It's not for running this. It's just for cash, for comfortable. It happened to your retro Reeboks. No, go ahead and pull it up. When your lift rang, it's normal for you to perform utility quality software in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,12,2022-10-06 14:41:34
2694," You tried on a pair of Nike? Very good though. I tried on a pair of sock and ease. Good running shoe. It's not for running this. It's just for cash, for comfortable. What happened to your retro Reeboks? No, go ahead and pull it. I didn't then, not yet. Not yet. I'm still thinking about. I'm still thinking, I'm still. Okay. Percolating. We got one 60 bucks. Just do it. Let's do it. Bye now. All right. We're going to continue to track shares of Nike here on throughout the rest of the day on that. But also, keeping close tabs on shares of Pinterest here today, take your simple P.I.N.S. Up 3.6% today. This is this morning after Goldman Sachs, analysts Eric Sheridan gave the company an upgrade to buy from neutral, raise the price target to $31 per share, saying that he left a recent meeting with senior Pinterest management with increased confidence here. There were a few things that were called out as a part of this. One of them, according to the analysts, companies, leaders are focused on monetizing its platform, working to raise the amount of inventory that users can purchase and making that more shoppable, which is what we continue to talk about. A good social media company, even if Pinterest doesn't want to be called a social media company, let's be real here. It's going to come back to the e-commerce, the shop ability of a platform that is so directly annexed to this idea of its users coming there and finding inspiration or inspiration, if you will. As long as users aren't flocking to another platform or getting taught by TikTok, how to do something, and then having a purchase decision that gets triggered from there, then Pinterest perhaps can maintain some of that fanfare among its new consumers, and that triggering a better average revenue per user on the site too. I like this note, and one reason why I like it is because I was at that Goldman Sachs conference. I saw Eric working in the room, and I saw the Pinterest team there. So this is a very thorough, I think, well thought out report by Eric Sheridan, who came on with us at the event, talked a lot about the headwinds that tech is facing right now, but there's a lot of expectations now built into Pinterest, and I think a lot of that rests on New CEO Bill Ready, delivering against some of these expectations, and I would just caution investors that it might take a couple quarters to see his vision play out on the top and bottom lines of Pinterest. Those shares are actually downless this year than I would have expected. All right, let's talk about, and speaking of shares that have been going down, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan upgrading the stock from underweight to neutral setting, a positive impact from the Lenders reported restructuring plan. You can see the shares are bouncing a little bit today. They're up just about 1% in US trading, that is. Of course, they also trade in their native Switzerland, and JP Morgan, it's a pretty wonky node here, but basically they're outlining two scenarios. In the first scenario, a dramatic restructuring of the bank with a 70% shrink in its investment banking operations and exit from fixed income commodities and currency trading and equities trading. So that would indeed be a big change in that scenario. Their tier one capital ratio would actually stay the same according to JP Morgan. In the second scenario, they assume yet another half-hearted investment bank restructuring, and they seem to be a little bit less positive on that particular scenario. So still some scenarios for Credit Suisse to sort of pull through this without needing to raise additional capital. I guess it's kind of the bottom line here by selling shares. This is a good bedtime read. The Niki guy died, right? They'll just do okay. All right, before we get... Giving people information. Well, you know what, here's the thing. Niki is then great. Pinterest, maybe they'll do better, and Credit Suisse will see what they do. Guys, coming up on the other side of this short break. We've got our, well, we've got much more here on Yahoo Finance, including, well, we don't have the fan who caught Aaron Judges' 60-second home on ball, but guess what? He's fielding offers upwards of $2 million. We've got more on the other side. Thank you. key. key. option Thanks",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,13,2022-10-06 14:46:18
2695," Djz Slava, the base. Time for Cup for Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. People still want their Costco hot dogs and bulk groceries despite rising prices. The Costco reported another strong month of sales. For September with net sales up 80 or 8.5%. 80.5% year over year. This despite same store sales dipping on lower gas prices. All right. You're taking a look at some of the comps up 8.5% year over year for Costco. People still want it. You love it. I love it. I will refrain from saying something funny on the hot dog. When you're looking at the prices, it's a good deal to see prices decelerate in September vs. August. That inflation in a lot of these daily categories, like Costco grocery stores, you name it. It's starting to roll over over a little bit. And that's a good thing for consumers spending into the holidays. I think they recently said that they're not going to raise their membership price yet. You're predicting one that was made. It's coming this year. Yes, yes. On the gold. It's not coming this year. It waited me the last minute, but it's going to be a big earnings driver for that company. And I mean comparatively, Costco, BJs, Sam's Club underneath of Walmart, all of them had been trying to cozy up to the consumer, especially in the bulk buying boom that would seem to be. Indeed. All right. Uber is reviving itself driving vehicle plan after selling its autonomous driving research division. Uber signed a 10 year deal with an emotional to add self driving cars to its vehicle lineup. The self driving cars would work for both Uber and Uber Eats and several US cities upon launch. Still no details on where, where that will be. And I recently saw some of my first self driving cars out in San Francisco. I know some, you know, going to New York going to another place. And I think it was a Zooks. I can't see how these are the future. I still have a driver behind them. And I still ordered Uber. I didn't order a Zooks, but they look cool. That's all you got for me. Yeah. It seems like it's really early stage. I mean, regulations, like nothing is there yet. I've interviewed the CEO of Zooks and the founder of Zooks before. And of course, all of those companies that you kind of lumped together there between Zooks, between Waymo and then even for Uber and some of their driverless technology. It's all going to be dependent upon how well they're also able to license that out to some other companies that want to take advantage of it in the future too. Again, a lot of reds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,15,2022-10-06 14:53:00
2696," For Uber and some of their driverless technology, it's all going to be dependent upon how well they're also able to license that out to some other companies that want to take advantage of it in the future too. But again, a lot of red tape that they've got to get through and then additionally when you think of the customer and how this is going to be able to cut down cost for the customer as well as the company, operating cost per mile, north of a dollar, this could perhaps bring it below 40 cents. All right, and a big payday for the lucky baseball fan who caught Aaron Judges, that Aaron Judges ball, the ball estimated to bring in $2 million at auction. As of now, the Dallas-based man that caught the ball has not decided what he wants to do with it. He could give it back to Judge and the Yankees where he could sell it himself. Another unknown is taxes. The IRS has yet to come in but some experts speculate catching the ball could count is a taxable... Isn't this guy a millionaire? That's what I was told by our team. I don't know anything about him. Oh good for him. So then is it a capital gains tax because you paint for the... Sounds like he could afford it. To go to the game and then now your return on that is you actually get a good bet off. I mean, I just think it's fascinating that the regulations are such that when you catch a ball it becomes your property and one of our producers, Connor Hickey, was explaining to us it's written on purpose that way because it absolves them of liability if you are injured by a ball. I think I think... I think flying, right? Whether it's a bat or a ball or whatever it may be. I think Conor owns a lot of Mickey Mantle rookie cards so he's sitting on that goal. He knows a lot about this. Alright guys coming up next we're going to talk a little Tesla. Stick around. Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla, T-S-L-A. Yeah, they are moving lower on the day right now by the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,15,2022-10-06 14:54:28
2697," Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla, T-S-L-A. Yeah, they are moving lower on the day right now by about 1.2 percent. Questions have swirled around the tech-tightened sales of Tesla shares to finance is deal-making coupled with whether he might be too distracted to hit targets at Tesla. Craig Irwin, Roth Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst joins us now. Craig, you have a neutral rating and a $250 price target on Tesla. Now that we got that out of the way, help us answer some of these questions here. First and foremost, is Elon Musk too distracted to run both Twitter and Tesla? And what does that mean for Tesla? Just one point for regulatory reasons. The split-adjusted price target is 85. The last printed note is pre-split. So is Elon Musk too distracted to run Tesla? Frankly, Tesla is his baby. This company is a great expression of his personality. And he has shown tremendous capability to manage many different things, neuralink, the boring company, SpaceX, and other outside ventures. And the intellectual curiosity necessary to execute pretty well there. So will it possibly take time away from Tesla? Yes. I think the question that probably needs to be asked is, will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And I'm not the best judge of that. I think he already has some pretty clear ideas on Twitter. And he does have a history with PayPal and the digital payments space, which I think is part of his vision on fixing that asset. So it doesn't bother me for Tesla. I have other reasons that I'm very bearish on the company, but I have tremendous respect for what they've done. Well, we'll get to those reasons in a second, Craig. But does it even matter if Elon is distracted? Who cares? And I mentioned that because we have EV tax credits in play that are probably going to be a big tailwind to Tesla. And then we have cars that people just really seem to be obsessed about. Yeah, I mean, they've done each tremendous job, right? They've basically made the automotive industry sexy again. The last time it was sexy was the 1950s. That was when it's a come out of the best universities in the world and say, oh my gosh, I want to work for a car company. Now, those same kids are coming out and saying, I want to work on electric vehicles. The work on future drivetrain technologies, Elon Musk deserves a lot of that credit, because it's his vision and his commitment that's allowed that to take place. Does it really matter for Tesla so much? Not really. The flywheel is rolling. It's running. And they have very different issues to manage through over the next couple of years. Then what they've had to challenge through to date. And whether or not Elon Musk is the one that's the right person to make those decisions, we'll find out. I'm skeptical. I think there's some very challenging things ahead for this company. If Musk is maybe reducing his intensity with the company, it might not be a bad thing. Craig, I know there's no imminent changes at the top of Tesla, but is there anybody else there who could run the thing besides him? Oh gosh, that's a tough question. I don't think so. I've talked to a lot of former Tesla executives. I know people that have turned down positions at Tesla that are leaders. They're respect to various. It's a difficult company to work at because Elon Musk is an unreasonable person. Not in a bad way, but in a motivating way where he doesn't take no for answer. He wants to learn what you got wrong, why you got it wrong, how you're going to do a different to achieve the goal. So yes or no, yes, we got it. No, we didn't. A lot of people aren't well cool to work in that environment. There's a lot of burnout and a lot of turnover as people like to talk about for Tesla with heavy, heavy departures over here. Craig, I only got 30 seconds here. Colder months. They're coming soon. China and Tesla production. That's going to remain one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns.

2698," one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns as it doesn't seem China is going to change their zero COVID policy anytime soon. Yeah, China's China's going to be tough for them. That's going to determine whether or not they make their numbers this year, 20,000 20,000 unit months or 19,000 unit months. China, right. I don't think this is what's the biggest issue for the company. The biggest issue is competition and alternative equity is like Porsche and the upcoming Ford spin off large well established properties that are executing well. You have other examples of some of the SPAC IPOs that are actually showing success. Test has big problems on the horizon as far as this competitive environment and they don't really have the technology lead that many many people claim everybody has access this same gender base. Imagine that competition for Tesla Craig. Thank you so much Craig Irwin Rothkopf little partner senior research analyst appreciate your time this morning. Thank you. Thank you.

Goldman Sachs by the way stays bullish on oil raising its crude forecast to $110 a barrel. That's an aftermath of this OPEC plus decision. Joe Biden's his move cut move was cut was shortsighted and we'll see if the energy world's Dan Dicker agrees with us and investors wait for progress on the newly revived discussion between Twitter and Elon Musk. We look at the chance of a deal and the flow of information if we get one. But first let's take a quick look at the markets we see the Dow under a little bit of pressure down about 100 points the S&P 500 off about 1 quarter of a percent and then Nasdaq off just slightly and then checking in on the bond market we do see yields elevated just ever so slightly in the looks like the 5 10 and also 30 year tenor and with all eyes on tomorrow's jobs report. Let's welcome in Black Rocks global chief investment strategist way Lee and could you please give us your forecast and by the way it's great to see you here could you please give us your forecast of what you expect tomorrow because this is 1 half 50% of the feds dual mandate a lot of eyes on this report. Hi there good morning thanks for having me so in terms of the jobs report I think given how strong earlier momentans are it's possible that we could see kind of headline decrease but I would say that our focus is really solely what mainly around the participation rate because labor shortage has really contributed to this supply shaped environment. So if that starts to be alleviated certainly that would have feed through to inflationary dynamics and that would feed through to market pricing for rate hikes and also broadly risk sentiment as well. Let me ask you just generally about some of the central bank actions we've seen around the world over the last two weeks a bit of a 180 by the bank of England now buying bonds albeit for a short period of time. I think that we're seeing a lot of the same as the other banks are also the banks of the bank of Japan buying the US dollar try or excuse me buying its own currency the end trying to strengthen that versus others as well as the US dollar what are you seeing in the global effects world and what implications do you think this might have for equities especially as we consider these jobs numbers that you just explained to us. So really is the a result of this supply driven new regime that we're in whereby given the fact that inflationary pressure comes from supply bottlenecks and supply shortages then it's a lot harder for central banks to fight that their tools are primarily focused on addressing the demand side of the equation. You talked about bank of England going from announcing QT to start buying bonds obviously there are specific kind of fiscal development in the UK that led to the the bond buying but more broadly it just goes to show how difficult it is for a central bank decision making in this supply driven environment characterised by tougher trade offs and you also talked about bank of Japan and more broadly. So I think it's a totally policy development and currency as well I will make one observation so far this year depending on where you are based depending on which currency you are denominated your experience of the global market returns can be vastly vastly different right part of that is the dollar strength but it's more than that as well so dollar in a near term is very much driven by rate differential as well as global risk on and risk of sentiment so far has been very very strong. But given the fact that how much currencies are contributing to the experience of investors of the global markets we think that is actually really important when we think about our allocation to consider where our investors and clients are based in which is why we're rolling out regional our allocation so for example I am sitting here in the UK.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,18,2022-10-06 15:06:46
2700," where our investors and clients are based in, which is why we're rolling out regional asset locations. So for example, I am sitting here in the UK, and we recently wrote out Euro asset location views. So really from the perspective of Euro-denominated investors, how their asset location could look like versus a dollar denominated investors. And that is critical. Being local is critical in the context of the elevated macro uncertainty and elevated currency volatility. Yeah, call it part for the course versus, I guess based on this trend of deglobalization that we've seen over the last five plus years. Now, I want to talk a little bit more generally about the, we saw the US dollar strength in versus most currencies quite considerably. It's backed off of that. And the other part of the equation there is with an easing US dollar in the short term, we're seeing a bid for commodities. Now, we've been talking a lot about OPEC plus and oil, but I want to focus on silver, gold, and some of the other commodities that we've recently catch a bid. A lot of people have either been waiting for gold to catch a bid or have just counted it out entirely. What do you think of the precious metal complex right now? Well, exactly as you framed the correlation between the dollar and precious metal has been in place. And I think in that context as dollar, we can, you talked about how the risk on the sentiment earlier in the week led to a weaker dollar. It has been somewhat supportive of commodities and precious metals for that matter. But I would broadly say though the importance of diversification cannot be overstated in the context of the world that we're entering into. So thinking about the macro environment, we're currently expecting a recession. This year in Europe, in the UK, and next year in the US. And at the same time, risks of central banks over tightening policies into restrictive territories in order to fight inflation. The risks of that have risen significantly. Recently, but also certainly versus beginning of the year. So in this kind of environment where it makes sense to be more prudent when it comes to our location, when it comes to portfolio taking, than having diversification in portfolio makes sense and certainly go to play the role in that. And I think that is also part of the considerations behind recent price action. We got a time for one more, a bit brief here. But I want to talk to you about the Chinese UN and also policy makers there. We've seen the UN strengthen against the Japanese yen about 12% year to date. Yen has considered, has weakened considerably. And I talked about the measures by the BOJ before. Do you think the PBOC intervenes to in the in the in the in the Yuan here? And what consequences would that have for global risk assets? Well, I think more broadly when we talk about the Chinese Yuan, we also have to talk about the Chinese economy. Right? So what has happened so far this year is that there has been significant headwind for Chinese economy from the perspective of the zero-covid policy acting as a dampener to economic reopening momentum and at the same time previously the Chinese economy was supported by the tailwind of global export. Like when the rest of the world was in shutdown, the export from China and the demand for that has added to strong momentum last year. But now the rest of the world is switching back on and China is in zero-covid mode. So that export tailwind is is is fading away as well as the the China economy is in a way as well. And both of their act as headwind and challenges for Chinese economy this year and the Chinese currency movement so far this year are reflection of that. You talked about versus the yen but also versus the dollar of the dollar story is beyond more than just Chinese Chinese Yuan. I would say one thing though as we kind of had into next year, some expectation needs to be big deal around the restart momentum obviously a lot contingent on how the COVID policy would evolve. But in the same way that the US economy opened up with strong momentum, your PM economy opened up with strong momentum in such an expect higher growth levels next year versus 2022. Surprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,19,2022-10-06 15:11:23
2701," went up with strong momentum, your PM economy, opened up with strong momentum in such an exact higher growth levels next year versus 2022. So, please say lots of moving parts here. Really appreciate your insights. As always, Waili, BlackRock, Global Investment, Chief Strategist, thank you for your time. And we're keeping an eye on oil prices as well. This morning following a big move by OPEC Plus to slash output by two million barrels a day beginning in November, exceeding market expectations and incurring the wrath of the Biden White House for more on this. Let's welcome in, Yahoo, finances in S for A. And we got a little bit of a surprise yesterday. And as we've been talking about, now OPEC Plus has already not been able to fulfill its quotas. So they said, this is really just a cut of about one to 1.1 million barrels per day. That's still a lot of nests. Yeah, that is, it's significant. It's a significant cut. And a one takeaway is that OPEC Plus must be concerned about a worldwide recession in order to be making such a cut. Goldman Sachs came out with a forecast and updated forecast saying that oil could reach $110 a barrel in Q4, also $115 a barrel by the end of the first quarter of 2023. And if these cuts are sustained through December of 2023, then these elevated prices would remain elevated. I mean, the only thing that could bring it down is really demand destruction at this point. Now, during the financial crisis, Jared, between 2008, 2009, oil prices, those had peaked at $145. They came all the way down to $35 a barrel in five months time. Andy Lipo of Lipo Associates is saying basically that, look, they must be worried in order for them to be doing this. It also shows you that the US dollar has also been having a huge impact on these oil prices. And we've also seen some rubblings or heard them that the Biden White House would also consider another release from this strategic petroleum reserve that's the SPR. We saw that take a place and be in effect earlier this year. I think those purchases or those releases have now concluded, but what about the possible effects of any new releases from the SPR? Yeah, well, certainly that would have a short term effect. Like we've seen with gasoline prices, as we've seen those gasoline prices coming lower. But one interesting point also about this OPEC plus decision is it kind of also shows you the waning influence of the US, because this is as much as it is about demand and supply as it is also political in a way as well. And the sort of relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the sort of waning influence that the US is having on the cartel as well. Yeah, and I'd add the most important influence the US has on the cartel is the fact that WTI, and most global oil, is quoted in US dollars. So a huge investment, I would guess you would say, to protect right there. Thank you for that. Yeah, who finances in that for it? All right, our trending ticker of the day is Pinterest. It is surging 45% after Goldman Sachs upgraded and stopped to buy from Newfoundland, raised its price target to $31 from $24. Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan likes the improvements in user growth and engagement, as well as the potential for revenue growth and operating margin into next year in 2024. Monetization is a key area that Goldman also likes with the prospect for the social media company increasing its share of ad spending, and that says companies cut budgets and expenses and coming up. You're going to want to take a look at this. Talking cyclical stocks, the ride continues, love that plan continues for Peloton as a pandemic era, darling announces 500 more job cuts. We're about 12% of its workforce. Will the struggling group find its feet? Will we take the deep dive next?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,20,2022-10-06 15:17:10
2702,"'' Welcome back. Peloton laying off a large number of its employees. The new CEO of Berri McCarthy, who is looking to cut costs and make sure that in this environment where the company is trying to create more partnerships on the wholesale front, see more of their cash and capital be put towards actually being able to continue production but also the right sizing of production and overall just the structure of the company that that really comes down and hits some of unfortunately the employee base. Now what we also do know is that even over the course of earlier this week they had netted some new partnerships on the wholesale front and it really kind of spells out what Berri McCarthy is looking to do is tap some of those wholesale partners look to those channels to potentially drum up even more subscribers within everything from Dick Sports all the way to your Hilton state and then eventually being able to at the same time build on the digital subscriptions the number of people that are continuing to use these connected devices but then it comes back to if he does not see the growth necessary in this next stretch of time and he's looking out to the six month period even out as far as 18 months perhaps to say whether or not Peloton has been successful at implementing some of these strangers and if it will prove to push them back to profitability as well. One at Hone and we got a brief second here on that timeline. Sure. Now he based but this is McCarthy basically gave the company six months and he did not mince words here have you ever heard a CEO of a company give a going concern risk factor to its employees basically in this context. Not one that isn't already looking at perhaps some type of bankruptcy. It would have to be imminent. Imminent threat and what's even more noteworthy about that is whether or not they would actually be looking for a sale if they would be looking for a sale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,21,2022-10-06 15:20:13
2703," a bankruptcy precedent. It would have to be imminent. Imminent threat. And what's even more noteworthy about that is whether or not they would actually be looking for a sale if they weren't able to hit some of those potential targets, because he did bring up this thought of, I don't know if we are a standalone company or a viable standalone company, just Peloton, if we're not able to hit some of these financial targets that we've set forth. He did say that this is the most optimistic that he has been, but he certainly to your point did not mince words there, and it starts to raise the question about who would buy a Peloton, especially when you've already got other stationary bikes that are being sold at Dix, that are already being sold on Amazon. So then it gets into the rest of the fitness category and the connected device category too, and it's really tough to sell on whether or not it would be a company in Apple or some other major tech company that would say, no, what? Yeah, we'll take on a connected fitness device company where they've already struggled to kind of mule-outs in new homes. There's a lot of baggage there. We'll have to see what happens, but Peak Peloton with the stock down over 90%, we'll see what comes of that. Thank you for that, Brad Smith. Thanks. And now a new game, all the kids are playing as well as Wall Street veterans, and they're raging about it. SPAC, D-SPAC, or Fold, and who better to join us with an update of this beleaguered sector is Alexander Seminova. Alex, excuse me, you've been covering this, and IPOs have done poorly this year. SPAC's much worse. What are the details? Yeah, just a terrible time for the SPAC market, such a huge turnaround from last year, and the year before, what has been called, the SPAC Renaissance Miss Chaud, saw this sharp uptick in SPAC activity, and it really a big come down this year. SPAC liquidations are on the rise with these Blaine check companies, really struggling to find targets for their deals to close so far this year. 22 special purpose acquisition companies worth about $10 billion have been liquidated, according to a weekly report by SPAC research. That's more than that. And more than half of those liquidations have occurred since August, and that's not even taking into consideration the liquidations that have been announced and haven't actually happened yet. For example, last week, Chimoth Pallia Petia set in a regulatory filing that he would liquidate to of his SPACs, also after failing to find a target and return $1.6 billion to investors, Bill Ackman also liquidated his vehicle. So it's just one after the other that is falling apart. Yeah, and I read an interesting stat yesterday that 40% of these companies, SPAC companies are issuing going concern warnings. That means they might go out of business for their investors, and that's double the IPO rate. But I want to hone in on some news today. George Soros' son, in, well, he's been part of the SPAC movement as well. And we've got some details there. You can share with us. Yes, so Bloomberg reported yesterday that the Everton Football Club spurred takeover interest from a SPAC led by George Soros is nephew that's according to people familiar with the matter. But there's no certainty yet whether the transaction will be closed, especially in this market where some deals are announced, but they don't actually follow through because the conditions are changing so rapidly. Yep, rapidly changing conditions. We've come to see this as the new norm. Yahoo, finances, Alex, Simon Overt, thank you for sharing that. Coming up, Black Gold getting a tailwind, Goldman's oil team stays with a bullish call for $110 for Per barrel on Brent, over at the White House President Biden labels, OPEC plus short-sighted surprise surprise, we look at the prospect for prices up next. to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,22,2022-10-06 15:24:54
2704,"ayer. Welcome back the bold seam in control after the third quarter kicked off with a big two-day rally, but a slew of economic data ahead could alter the market optimism. And I want to get a quick check of the Wi-Fi interactive where we can see energy in the forefront today, followed by communication services, tech and consumer discretionary. Those are at the top, what you see in green. To the downside, utilities is down almost 2% followed by real estate and healthcare. All of those are defensive sectors and let's get a check of the majors now and we can see a mix board. Nasdaq, just barely in the green by seven basis points, it's been fluctuating all day and then the Dow is down about one third of a percent and the S&P 500 down one fifth of a percent. So without further ado, we want to talk about the current market action and that is with Kelly Cox, she is E-Torrell's US Investment Analyst and Kelly, always great to see you here. We've done a number of webinars together and we've talked about some of the statistics in the S&P 500 and I think you and I were looking at some of the same data this week and what were you looking at? What were some of the conclusions that you came to? Yeah, dear, we were looking at some of the same data. I mean, the rally we've seen so far this week or at least on Monday and Tuesday has been fierce, I think we can all agree on that. But it's so fierce. I mean, it's the first time the S&P has rallied 2.5 percent or more in back-to-back days since December 2008 and you and I both ran the data, right? We see these kinds of rallies either deep in their market or in the first few days after a bull market starts, which is the exact opposite to an area there, right? And it just goes to show just how complicated this environment is for investors, how just the motion fueled and panicky it feels and it's quite a tough position to be in because we could be staring down to different paths here. And so investors who are nervous right now, what is your advice to them? Hopefully everybody's sitting on piles of cash, but that's not necessarily the case. I know that I have a significant amount deployed, got some on the sidelines here ready to be deployed. What are you telling your clients right now? Yeah, well, it's interesting you say that because you've seen the sentiment and the sour moon that the market is in, I'd expect there to be more cash on the sidelines than then we think. But at the same time, we're telling our clients to really manage your emotions here, to understand where the market environment is, but also the fact that it could be very costly to miss out on the first few days of a bull market. We really like a barbell strategy here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,23,2022-10-06 15:29:29
2705," and where the market environment is, but also the fact that it could be very costly to mess out on the first few days of a bull market. We really like a barbell strategy here, holding on to some risk, but being defensive at the same time. And where do you see the market opportunities when this market finally turns around? Maybe it already has, maybe the lows in, but that's not necessarily the sure bet right now. What kind of sectors or styles are you looking at? Yeah, well, this market really is bottoming. We would expect to see more of an uptick and risk here, more of a more of a surging growth year asset here. We really like quality risk though at the moment. I mean, there are a lot of different flavors of growth stocks. We all know that with tech, you could look at the more speculative concept stocks, or you could look at big tech. We think big tech is a good example of quality risk with strong financials. And at the same time, we really like cyclicals here, but we're feeling a little more cautious at the moment only because we don't know what the future holds for us here. And if we see growth deteriorate much more, we could see that reflected in physical stocks. Hey, Kelly, I was writing our newsletter this morning, the morning brief. Actually, I wrote it yesterday afternoon for publication this morning, but it was about those very same market statistics that you were talking about. After I ran the data and I saw kind of a mixed bag there, I kind of went off on a rant. And you know, you and I love to parse the data and look for things. Sometimes we don't always find an edge. Maybe you did, maybe I didn't, but I think my message for investors is sometimes you just got to turn off the news, not Yahoo Finance, of course, while you're watching this broadcast, but you got to filter out the noise, just wondering what you're thinking about this as you also talk to some of your clients. Oh, it's so hard because it's so noisy these days and there are so many things you can look at to find that signal. And I mean, here, I do know I like parsing through data. You just said that, but I always try to remind people that when we see these big and up and down days, there's something significant happening. What that's significant to, what that moment or significance is, we're not really sure yet. And I know that's not super helpful, but you have to really remember, you know, your own goals and your own needs, especially strongly in times like this, you know, really focus on why you're investing and what kind of time horizon you have because that will help you determine which market and which voices you listen to. That's right. Focus on risk management and your timeframe. Lots of signal in that interview, not a lot of noise. Thank you for that, Kelly Cox, EToro USA investment analyst. Coming up next, the House of Pain is in effect witness by the surging US dollar, but also in the housing market, US home prices have been falling at the fastest price pace since the financial crisis, but is the fed intent on breaking the market to save the economy?

2706," Feeding Welcome back. Oil prices heading higher with crude oil WTI above $88 per barrel. And that's after OPEC plus's decision to cut output yesterday by 2.1 million barrels. What does this mean for the energy space? Let's bring in Dan Dicker, founder of the Energy World. We're Dan. Let me talk to you about this report here. Glad to have you always great to hear from you. This is an effective cut of a lot less than 2.1 million barrels per day because OPEC plus has not been living up to their quotas because they can't pump necessarily that much out of a lot of the countries. What is your take? And Dan, you might have to unmute yourself on the phone. We're not getting any audio at this time. Alright, it looks like we're going to have to go to break. We're going to see if we can get Dan Dicker back on the phone right after this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,25,2022-10-06 15:37:10
2707," Harlemague Welcome back. A quick check of the markets now where we see everything under a little bit of pressure. The Dow is down by 4.10% of the S&P 500 a little bit less. And the NAS deck, as I'm looking at at the Wi-Fi interactive down just seven basis points. And now a quick check of the bond market as well. We're seeing the 10 year Tino yield up about five basis points. Let me see if we can get a read on the five year here. That is up seven a little bit more. And the 30 year is up 2%. So the front end of the curve receiving a little bit of a boost there. The 13 week T bill yield about break even down just slightly from yesterday's levels. And also the dollar, the dollar after being under a little bit of pressure over the last couple weeks showing signs of strength. And that is weighing on a part of the equities complex here today. Not the energy sector. We see XLE. That's up about 1%. Followed by the mega cap sector's communication services, tech, consumer discretionary, just barely up there. All of those out performing to the downside, seeing utilities and real estate underperform each of those down about 2%. Now, anyone shopping for a new home has seen it firsthand. US home sales going hot from hot to ridiculous levels. Yahoo, finances, Danny Romero has more on how the feds inflation fighting tactics are weighing on the housing market. What are you seeing? Jared, what I've been hearing the way it's being described to me as that the housing market is being brought to its knees by the Federal Reserve. That's what a macro strategy is from bespoke investments told me yesterday. Following the drop in the mortgage demand from the associate from that we saw from the mortgage bankers association seasonal index. So yes, those higher mortgage rates are really taking a hit on the housing market and it could get worse. That macro strategist is estimating that the volume of mortgage demand could fall 10%. And not only that, but mortgage rates could peak 8%. Yes, today we did see mortgage rates dip to 6.6%. But to put this into perspective, climbing rates has added $337 to a typical monthly mortgage payment. That is according to redfin data. But again, this all goes back to the feds decision. If they continue to slow down economic activity, then we are going to see slower demand for mortgages. And so far, there's been no indication that the fed is backing off. And we also haven't had any inflation prints to show that inflation is coming down. That's right. Part of the fed strategy is to, well, not cripple the economy, but also, but hamper the economy a little bit. Unemployment has to rise. And we already, you just said that people are facing mortgage increases in their mortgage payments of about $330 somewhere in that ballpark. Is there a ray of sunshine? Where's the hope here? Yeah. So home prices have come down, but against, again, that's not really correlated to inflation. One part of the housing market that is correlated to inflation is rents. Apartment rents have come down. We saw that from July to August. But that's because people are paying so much for everything else that there's really no little wiggle wiggle room really for rents. So yes, landlords are losing their pricing power. Tenants are, they're also losing tenants as well. So yes, rents are still elevated and prices are high. They're expected to come down, but that could take some time and also it goes back to the issue of supply and demand. Yeah, with a lag and not going to help me on that lease, I just signed, but thank you for the report here. Yeah, who finances Danny Romero? Coming up next, it's a grab bag. Who knows what we're going to talk about? Yeah, who finances Danny Romero just joined us, but we have more on the other side of this break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,26,2022-10-06 15:41:43
2708," It's considered a natural礼, so we'd like to measure investment houses. Welcome back. Oil prices heading slightly higher about half a percent up and that's after OPEX plus decision to cut output. And let's talk about what this means for the energy space with Dan Dicker. He is the founder of the energy word and we have him on the phone here. Dan, always great to talk with you. The official cut was 2.1 million barrels per day but in effect it is much much less than that. Why is that? Well, basically Jared, it's because OPEX has been under producing what it has been promising the market since December of 2021 and that's only grown. I mean, you might have realized that they've been increasing their limits, their production gaps almost every month since December of 2021 but not meeting those limits and it's sort of kind of grown to the fact that now there's a shortfall between what they've been promising and what they've actually been producing of somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 million barrels a day. So it's very, from a practical point of view, it's not clear how much of a practical effect this cut will have but of course from a psychological point of view, it's enormous. I mean, this is OPEC reasserting their control of a market that has as bad as a supply problem from a global standpoint as I've ever seen in the 40 years that I've been covering oil. So if you're going to try and beat down prices as the Europeans and Biden have been trying to do with Fed, Fed rate hikes and quantitative tightening and of course releases from the SBR, you do find that OPEC had had enough and was saying, look, we've got a fundamental market here that should support prices closer to 3 digits and we don't like oil going under $80 a barrel. So they called an emergency meeting and they've made a statement here saying they're going to try and prove.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,27,2022-10-06 15:46:56
2709, support prices closer to three digits and we don't like oil going under eighty dollars about so they called an emergency meeting and they've made a statement here saying you know they're going to try and prove to uh... Biden and the europeans that this is a supply problem and not really a pro a price problem in this cli in this ties closely to the relationship between the u.s. and the Saudis i believe it was several months ago the uh... Saudis announced a one hundred uh... thousand barrel per day protection cut and i think that was an olive to the by the administration was only hours after that that by the announced that yes i'm going to meet with the saudis for the first time here uh... what is this mean for the relationship with the u.s. going forward when you have this level of disagreement yeah i mean look there's a visit by the isn't a very interesting spot and of course the Saudis are a an ally of the united states and they they they rely on the united states for military supplies as well as support not ways so uh... but there is also the other side of the story which nobody really wants to hear is that uh... Saudi Arabia is uh... you know an oil economy and at the the times when they can't get the revenues out that they feel that they deserve they they generally have to make some moves to try and protect those revenues now by the is coming up on not only on trying to uh... to uh... uh... a tackle of very bad inflation problem but he also has midterms that are coming up and high gas prices are a political nightmare so he is trying to balance again these relationships that he has with uh... middle east allies along with political needs he has as well as economic needs he has to get inflation under control and it's really it's going to be a war here between you know what the what the united states in the EU can do with much of this monetary policy that's really pushing down all sorts of risk assets including stocks but of course oil too and what the Saudis and the rest of opette can do trying to protect their market by really cutting production and adding to what's already a very deep deep supply problem and we and we got to leave it there always appreciate you stopping by and thanks for sticking around here on the phone dan dicker founder of the energy world all right while twitter shares they are up today and all looks like well they are down just slightly and that is after investors await progress on the newly revived discussions with Elon Musk the latest must and the group are reportedly delaying the billionaires long awaited deposition after his decision to proceed with the forty four billion dollar deal also admit discussions over financing writers reporting that apollo global management and six street partners who had been looking to stump up some of the money no longer are in talks polloglabel management is a parent company of yahu finance yeah who finances elixis keen and joins us now in elixis there was speculation yesterday that twitter wanted musloyer to disclose whether he reacted to an anonymous email what do we know about this yeah Jared so there was some speculation and it was about this may six email that twitter was asking the judge for more information the judge uh saying that musk might have to turn over more details on an anonymous sender that sent an email to musk's attorney alix bureau and it was thought that it might be connected to peter zatko the twitter whistleblower that has caused so much upheaval in terms of spam and bot counts and twitter security on its platform but in an affidavit to the judge today that was filed sphero said this to date i have taken no actions of any kind with respect to that may six email so kind of putting to bed that part of the speculation but as you know look at the share price today reflecting a lot of doubt still not quite leveling off to that fifty four dollar and twenty cent price that musk has now reproposed that he will close the deal there um the wall street journal reporting that the parties are going late into uh talks late wednesday still unsettled about how to move forward exactly despite the fact that musk has said in a letter that is now filed with the sec and that the court has its hand on saying that he'll go forward on those original terms but here's the problem there's some fuzzy language in that letter and what it says is it's pending musk's receipt of debt financing and what they're talking about there is the approximate twelve point five billion dollars that's coming from morgan stanley and is committed from morgan stanley uh but what's the hold up really it could be that debt fine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,28,2022-10-06 15:50:25
2710," at $12.5 billion that's coming from Morgan Stanley and is committed from Morgan Stanley. But what's the hold up really? It could be that debt financing language. It could also be possibly executive and employee compensation that needs to come out of this deal. Twitter might want some more terms around that. And also they might want indemnities to be inserted into this new re-up deal. We don't know for sure though, but let's focus back on that financing for just a minute. It was back in April on the 21st that Musk had said through his lawyers that more information on Twitter's fake accounts, those spam and bot accounts, was needed for Musk's financing. So I would think that Twitter would want to clarify that that is indeed not going to be the case if he is going to go through with this deal. Plus added to that, banks can independently assert a claim that a material adverse event has occurred. That would be a change, a major change in conditions that they could assert and say, well, that changes whether we can offer this financing to Musk. Now the lawyers that I've talked to have said that's probably not going to be the case. But we still have to wait and see here. But they do say that there's one key thing to watch for. And that is that deposition of Elon Musk that was scheduled to go forward today, but is now delayed. All these M&A lawyers that I'm in talks with, they say that certainly Twitter would want to have Musk's testimony before they go forward with any trial. The trial is still on the books, Jared, for October 17th. And we'll have to see what comes of this. And we're going to stick with the subject and pivot from legal battles. And thank you, by the way, for that Alexis Keenan. We're going to pivot from legal battles and financial wrangling to a bigger picture take on Elon Musk's potential takeover. Tesla's CEO has labeled himself a free speech absolutist and while heralded by some, it is stoked fears from civil rights organizations and equal measure. Now from Twitter as a business to the flow of information we're joined by Sinan Araw, MIT Sloan School of Management, Professor and author of the hype machine. Sinan, always great to see you here. So what's your take on this situation and its meaning for the future of Twitter? Great to see you. Thank you for having me. You know, I predicted that this is exactly what would happen. That this deal would go through. I actually predicted it would go through at a slightly lower price is the market choosing that price for me at the $50 range. There could be some negotiations about a slight price decrease in order to get assurances on the Twitter side from Musk and the financiers. More tight language about how they could or couldn't be required to go through with the deal. We'll see whether the prediction bears out exactly. Obviously, when the investors came in, it was a different climate. Now there's higher interest rates, there's inflation, there's a lot of uncertainty to the Ukraine war. Just this week oil prices, OPEC and Russia constraining supply. So it's a much different environment to finance debt. The banks could try to back out and could trigger this escape hatch for a billion dollars by Elon Musk. But there could be some negotiations and Twitter could say we want assurances and we'll negotiate something to get those assurances. Because remember for the Twitter board, this was a no brainer at $54. This was a great deal for them and they'll want this deal to go through. Assuming the deal goes through, first thing you're going to see is a mass exodus due to firings and people quitting. People who are currently at Twitter, inside information says that they do not want to work for Elon Musk's new Twitter organization. Mostly, many of them would leave on their own volition. Elon Musk is indicated that much of the Twitter leadership he does not approve of their decision making. So he might get rid of some people. So the compensation negotiation I think is less important because you're going to see a wholesale clean out and a wholesale change in the approach. You're going to see Donald Trump return to the platform almost immediately. You're going to see moderation rules relaxed towards this more free speech environment, although you can't get rid of moderation entirely. You're going to see attempts at the subscription model be more forthcoming in the short term, a lot more bot detection and bot removal as well. That's in the short term. And I think we should also talk a little bit about the long term expect web 3.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,29,2022-10-06 15:54:56
2711," for term, a lot more bot detection and bot removal as well. That's in the short term. And I think we should also talk a little bit about the long term, expect web three strategies to enter Elon Musk vocabulary. Will there be a Twitter coin? Will that be related to the subscription model? How will that be financing the business going forward? Well, you touched on monetization there, a key pillar of turning the business of Twitter around. I've seen some ideas floated that the business model could follow that have linked in and corporate some of that of YouTube. What does this look like to you and what does this mean for the platform? Yeah, I think Elon Musk has made clear that he thinks that an advertising alone business model cannot save this company. There are a lot of people that agree with this opinion. I think that Twitter has struggled to succeed with a advertising only business model. Twitter blue as a subscription model was kind of a, you know, toh's dangling in the water attempt to see how it would go. You can expect much more heavy commitment towards paying subscribers for premium services and or for institutional accounts to be part of the strategy of an Elon Musk Twitter. In addition, I think that you can imagine that there will be other types of subscription models. For example, selling access to particular types of institutions in terms of information that is packaged up as information services for institutions, whether it be for prediction purposes or for other types of purposes. And given that it will be a private company, there will be a lot less oversight from the public sphere over what's going on. And you can also imagine an attempt to be more inclusive of conservative voices, which would try to get at the user numbers that have been steady, but not really increasing at the rates that Elon Musk would like to see. Well, we got to leave it there. Sin and Al-Ral, but I really appreciate you stopping by and all of those insights as always. All right, we got to talk crypto now with Bitcoin hovering around $20,000. As I think it has done for half the year, we're going to bring in Yahoo finances, David Hollerith, who's going to talk to us about cryptocurrency space and David. What is the latest here? Because we've seen Bitcoin not, well, it's been trying to get off the dime here. But I've been saying Bitcoin $20,000, as I said before, for a pretty long time. Yeah, Jared, the reversal is here. And RISC version has taken Bitcoin. It briefly went below $20,000 earlier yesterday. And now it's hovering right above $20,000. This is the key psychological point. Obviously, this is sort of maybe a potential into the strong start in October that Bitcoin and equities have seen. I think there's a lot of expectation around the jobs report that will come out tomorrow. And the CPI print next week. And the expectation is that Bitcoin's fundamentals from here could expect what analysts are calling a healthy consolidation from here. And that should remain the case for a while. As we see, the Fed pivot idea is sort of not really caring much ground. But we see a double dose of robust hiring on Friday in a hotter than expected inflation report next week. We could see heavier consolidation. All right. We're going to have to leave it right there, if it but really appreciate your time here again today. And we want to get a quick check of the market before we leave you to break. And we are looking at a mixed market right now. You can see the NASDAQ slightly in the green up about 12 basis points. And the Dow and the S&P 500 still mired in red territory, though, but off of those lows. And let's get a quick check of the Wi-Fi interactive where I'm looking at our sector ETFs. And we can see energy still in the forefront WTI crude oil still up above $88 per barrel. Also communication services in tech, those ETFs in the green to the downside real estate and utilities extending their losses, each of those now down more than 2%. And just also looking at some of our leaders. We saw mean stocks really take off this week. Those are our leaders today. Those are a 2% followed by EWY.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,30,2022-10-06 15:59:05
2712," two percent and just also looking at some of our leaders. We saw meme stocks really take off this week. Those are our leaders today. Those are up 2 percent followed by EWI. That is a South Korean ETF followed by home builders, transports, socks. That is the chip stocks, software and internet stocks. Those are in the green to the red to the downside, seeing some losses here for the cannabis and solar ETF sectors. Also checking in on the bond market real quickly, we can see the 13 week T. Oh, that's the US dollar. That is up now 8 tenths of a percent, but we wanted to check on the 10 year Tino yield. That is up six basis points to 3.82 percent. That does it for the 11 to 12 hour list take a look at one. Well, we already took a look at the market. So I'll guess what? Just come back tomorrow. See you on the job today 8.25 AM Eastern. It's promptly. Thank you. Everyone, the S&P 500 has had its best back to back days since April 2020. And the best two days start to the fourth quarter, going back to the first full year of the five day trading week in 1953. For more on what this means, the four the market's going forward. Let's bring in RBC capital markets head of US equity strategy, Lower Calvacena, Lower Great to speak with you this morning. Of course, in the futures at least right now, we are discovering that it can indeed go the other way still. And so with that in mind, how are we really set up for the fourth quarter? Is this just the two days at least that we had seen to begin October and the fourth quarter? Is that just a bear market bounce or is there something more that you're seeing in the tape? Well, I think both of those things could be true. We actually went back and looked at how markets traded in 2002, 2003 in 2010, 2011. And how that compared with the environment we're in today. The reason why we're doing this is because we're doing this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,31,2022-10-06 16:03:08
2713," are there something more that you're seeing in the tape? Well, I think both of those things could be true. We actually went back and looked at how markets traded in 2002, 2003 in 2010, 2011, and how that compared with the environment we're in today. The reason we picked those periods is because we had come out of major crises, had an initial bounce, and then we basically settled into these kind of year, year and a half type trading ranges where bottoms were formed. It took quite some time to get that done. It was painful. It was bumpy. It lasted a long time. And I feel like as I peer into the early part of 2023, that's really what we're set up for. So we've come down. We're seen a big battle back at the June lows. We dipped a little bit below them. But I think markets, you know, I've heard a lot of people try to defend that 3500 level. I wouldn't say people are crazy bullish out there. That's certainly not a stretch, but I think there has been, you know, this talk of a potential pivot, maybe earnings have been, you know, kind of worked down in the minds of the buy side at least, even if numbers still need to come down. So I think people are trying to come up with reasons why the market could bounce here at the end of the year. And I do think if you look back at that 0203 and 2010, 2011 history, you can find a justification for it. Laurie, do you still think we will see a lengthy bottoming process? And how long do you think I will play out? So, you know, it's interesting because that 0202 example, the stock market has been trading with a 72% correlation this year, with that 2002 period. And when I think about 4Q and 1Q, what happened back then really does seem like a reasonable template for going forward. And what I mean by that is you think about the earnings backdrop. We're going into this reporting season where based on a lot of these pre-announcements, we're starting to see it does feel like the earnings mandate is going to be ripped off, at least to some extent. But I think that that's not really possible to do entirely until we get into February and March of next year. And that's going to be year ahead outlook season. That's when the full year numbers for 22 are going to be reported. And companies are really going to be forced to talk about 2023. And so I think you're not really going to be out of the woods from an earnings perspective until you get to that through that 4Q reporting season. And, you know, we'll sort of see what happens here in the next few weeks. I feel like, you know, kind of short term predictions on earnings reporting season never quite pan out for anybody. But I do think that that earnings mandate, we're just really not going to have that visibility on 2023 for a few more months. Given the calls that we're seeing around and describing what another recession could look like from everyone from the economists to CEOs right now. And some of them saying that it should be short and not painful. At the same time, there is the question of how it would actually compare in the stock market reaction to previous recessions as well. What do you believe that might look like? So I am in the short, shallow recession camp, and I know that feels awfully consensus. And there's always risk to consensus arguments. But I do think that both corporations and households are in a very strong position heading into this relative to past recessionary period. So I think the starting point matters and the starting point is very good relative to where we've been in the past. Now, when you think about stock market reactions, I think that's why 3500 is such a battleground. Because if you look at the history of recessionary drawdowns in the stock market back to the 1930s, the median drop has been about 27% peak to drop. And that takes you to 3501 on the S&P. If you look at a meet, if you look at an average recession drawdown, it's a little bit worse. It's about 32%, which takes you down to 3200 on the S&P. As I talked to some of my friends in the technical analysis community who just read the charts, they tell me 3,500 and 3200 are also important levels to watch. So that history does seem to be rhyming or kind of sinking up with some of those technicals. I have a very hard time believing this would be worse than what we saw in the pandemic when there was just enormous uncertainty, enormous fear. And that was a 34% drawdown. So it took you a little bit below that to 3200 mark. But I think it was interesting that when confronted with that great calamity that was building on the health side, markets basically priced in a typical recession. So it's very hard for me to think we're going to do much worse than that this time. Laurie, do you think this is a market that would cheer a Republican just to take over in the midterm elections? Markets historically, if you look at the combination of a Democratic president and either a Republican led or split leadership Congress, that has been one of the best environments for stocks over time. And again, we're looking at very long stretches of history on that.

We also know that investors intuitively like RIDLOT And a lot of investors have worried that the Democratic agenda and I'm not trying to cast you know any sort of You know kind of view on this personally, but what I hear from investors is that they worry that some of the Democratic initiatives That are have been on the table in the past that haven't gone through would end up adding to the inflation problem So I do think that markets you know would benefit from a sentiment perspective From the Republicans doing well this fall and I think what's really interesting about that is back in June and July Even when sentiment was pretty dour in the equity markets a lot of investors were telling me the Republicans are going to do well That's a potentially positive catalyst for markets markets typically do well in the fourth quarter of a midterm year And then we started to see the polling data and the betting market data start to shift against The Republicans and back in favor of the Democrats and I think that took some of the wind out of the sales of the market contributed to the down move We saw but now if you look at the real clear politics data is starting to suggest that Republicans are doing a little bit better in the generic ballot And I have to wonder if markets are starting to sniff that out when you look at the price action of the last few days Laurie I have to give you in your team a shy a lot of these charts that we showed throughout the segment came from your extensive research big fan Always of your charts. So please do keep them coming RBC capital markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvacino. We'll talk to you soon You You For more on the markets let's get to city global wealth head of investments for North America Kristen bitterly Kristen great to speak with you here this morning here as we continue to kind of put in context the move that we're seeing today With what we saw to kick off the fourth quarter. What is this really set up for the probability of everything from a actual bounce that is sustained To a Santa Claus rally that some might be looking for come December I think unfortunately I think these markets require patience discipline and and a bit of defense We expect that we're going to see volatility and choppy markets from here through the rest of the year And I think what we saw over the past two days and look I'm not one to criticize any market rally But it really was a function of what we saw back in June as well some very oversold conditions Peak bearishness we know sentiment is that all time lows And so the market just having a little bit of a relief rally I think we'd have to keep in mind though that in bear markets These types of rallies are actually quite common in eight out of the past 10 bear markets We saw rallies off the lows of more than 10 percent and they didn't happen just once They happened several times So these tactical bounces are to be expected But it doesn't mean that we're out of the woods yet So Kristen that the market a couple days ago cheered weaker than expected ISM data Today we're seeing the market not like some hotter than expected reads on 80 p.m. Employment and then on ISM services just moments ago Should bowls be rooting for bad news on the economy? I think it really just points to the fact that the Fed is in the driver's seat and we say don't fight the Fed in bull markets We should also say",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,33,2022-10-06 16:11:36
2715," for bad news on the economy. I think it really just points to the fact that the Fed is in the driver's seat. And we say, don't fight the Fed in bull markets. We should also say the same when we're dealing with bear markets. And so the Fed has been very resolute and very clear on their positioning in terms of the fact that inflation, their ultimate target is 2%, and we're not anywhere close to that. And also with inflation, the Fed is not just data dependent, they're trend dependent. They're not going to look at just one number. They're going to look at the overall trend. And we need to see that come down. The second part is employment, unless we see a material decline in employment or a rise in unemployment, I should say, that's not going to change their trajectory. So I think the market, this bad news is good news, good news is bad news, it's everyone hoping for a Fed pivot, and we don't see that. So what we are seeing though is some of the banks at least calling for what could be a soft landing or at least giving the Fed a little bit more credence to say, yeah, we've got more confidence that we had in the past. Or on the other side of that, you have some economists saying, you know what, it's not going to be as bad of a recession as we thought it might be. Which of the narratives really do you believe has the most credence here? I think you have to prepare yourself for the probability of a recession. We recently increased our probability to about 70% in 2023. And the reason for that is again, looking back at these two data points, which are really the overall inflation number as well as employment, unless we see any trend really change, we don't expect the Fed to pivot. And so all of the tightening that they've already done in terms of rate hikes being the fastest and steepest in history, combined with quantitative tightening, this has not flowed through to earnings. So this is something that those tight, that tightening of financial conditions can take anywhere from six to upwards of 12 or more months to really flow through to the economy. Which is why we think the earnings outlook when you look at consensus earnings growth for next year at around 8%, we think that's way, way too rosy. And we're actually expecting if we're continuing on this trajectory, that we would see an earnings contraction next year. If that's the case, Chris, in that 70% chance of recession does come to fruition with an actual recession, should investors be holding cash? Is cash no longer trash? So here's the thing in terms of our portfolios and how we're positioning. We are preparing for this environment. And so I think it actually depends upon your definition of cash and one of the things that I do think, if we have any bright spots in the market right now, is the fact that if we look just over two years ago, 40% of the world's government debt was negative yielding. Now we have six month T-vils that are close to 4%, we have a two year treasury that's north of 4%. And so what we've been doing is adding some of this fixed income exposure, very high quality because of this concern of a recession, but very high quality in terms of US government debt, looking at investment grade corporates, municipal bonds, and even some value in bank prefers as well. So there's ways of getting marginally higher yields and getting marginally better outcomes, but still being pretty defensively positioned. With where stocks are right now and where some of the valuations have dipped lower to, for those who have a long term time horizon, is this a safe time to get back into the markets or is there still kind of a leg lower that you would be tracking against? So market timing I think is a very, very challenging thing. As you mentioned earlier, we do see Santa Claus rallies sometimes and 80% of the observations in Q4 tend to be positive. And so one of the things that I think if you do have a medium to long term time horizon, when we look at situations where the S&P 500 has declined by 25% or more, looking forward out three years, there's never been a negative return. In fact, the average total return over that time period is close to 40% out five years. The average total return is around 85%. And so in terms of putting capital to work and looking at opportunities now, there certainly are opportunities if time is on your side. Hopefully it is. We'll leave it there.

2716," you you you Elon Musk's pending acquisition of Twitter This poise to send shock waves through society, but also the social media investing landscape. Joining us for more on this is Rohit Kolkarni, MKM Partners, senior analyst. Rohit, always great to get some time with you. We're seeing at least this morning, now I know you're not a Tesla analyst, but we're seeing Tesla Shlare share his under pressure on this news. How big a mess is Twitter going to be for Musk, meaning how much Kenny fix it, and how much do a distraction do you think will be to him in his various other efforts? Hey, thanks for having me. I think Twitter has been a case study in kind of how a great business or a great company can have issues with business fundamentals as in be it overhiring, under investing in technology, and not figuring out the exact go-to-market strategy, not figuring out the exact disclosure strategy. So there have been ebbs and flows in the levels of mismanagement in Twitter in my opinion. So I think near term, I feel Musk, if this deal actually happens, needs to figure out the top level, sea level exact team that they need to have in place. He's been pre-vocal about criticizing existing management team. So I wouldn't be surprised in the next three to six months. He figures out who would run Twitter. Until then, I think it's fair to say that he would be fairly distracted with probably putting more time behind Twitter and putting less time behind other things. Obviously, he's a guy who works 30 hours a day. So I'm sure he can manage that. Yeah, sending satellites into space orbit and ultimately producing electric vehicles for sustainability here on Earth seemed just a little bit more important in terms of prioritizing his time. But then you do have what will be a privately held company at that point in Twitter. How does that change? What Twitter looks like in the future? Musk has also talked about in the past how he doesn't like the rigmarole of being a publicly traded company sometimes and he was referring to Twitter back then or referring to Tesla back then. He will get that chance with Twitter. What changes about the company? I look unlike a SpaceX. I think SpaceX is a case story as to how a large company can stay private for such a long time and yet have all the capital needs kind of satisfied in a way that they can. I think if Twitter can be that, I think there's no better person than Musk to facilitate that transition from a public to a private kind of player. But having said that, one thing that Twitter has is it's inherently going to be under public scrutiny. It's one of the widest known brands in the world regardless of its size. More people follow Twitter for media than many other kind of media platforms. I'm sorry, Noh Rabati, who here. But no matter what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,35,2022-10-06 16:20:13
2717," is more people follow Twitter for media than many other kind of media platforms, sorry, Nora, but Yahoo, here. But no matter what, there is going to be public scrutiny. So I think after the restructuring, after figuring out a very smooth running business, I feel it's in the best interest of Musk and his team to bring Twitter back to public markets. There is a scenario here that it may be longer than three years that what he initially contemplated. It could be five years, but it's better to come back to public markets, a much more smooth lead on company, a much more well-managed business than staying private because no matter what, there is going to be public scrutiny on Twitter, not that politicians, world leaders, other leaders are going to stop using Twitter if it is going to be a private company. Roy, do you see Musk owning Twitter for the rest of his life? Or is this, he comes in, tosses out the existing management team, cans of a bunch of underperforming executives that enjoy the free coffee and various other perks at Twitter, restructures the business and he takes it public again in three years? In my opinion, Musk is very, very passionate about what the core value prop of Twitter is. And in terms of how he himself has used Twitter for essentially evangelizing ideas and even to some extent getting product ideas from in a crowdsourced manner. So I feel he would probably be involved in Twitter as one of the largest shareholders. He is the largest shareholder right now, whether he stays as the largest shareholder for the foreseeable future remains to be seen. I would guess that in the next probably three to five years, he's still going to be the largest shareholder beyond that. Once he thinks the vision of what he wants Twitter to be has been achieved, he probably fades into the background, but I don't see him completely going away from Twitter, neither as a user nor as an investor at any time in the next three to five years. You talk about monetizing Twitter further underneath of Musk and it would need to be reliant on advertising and perhaps that remaining a baseline, however you believe or and some of the other street analysts have also believed that that could be a detriment having having Musk over top of Twitter and advertisers not wanting to continue to advertise at least in the same type of accelerated fashion that they had over years, even after Twitter added video. If you saw a decrease in advertising, then you have to increase the number of paid users. Is Musk alone enough to increase the amount of people who are willing to say, you know what, I'll pay to use Twitter. Would you pay to use Twitter? You're kidding a lot of challenges that Twitter has already faced in the past in terms of balancing monetization and balancing user growth. Ideally, they want both, but management in the past hasn't been able to achieve both. It's probably lack of resources, lack of vision, lack of execution, you call it. So if there's a way to manage both and on top of it, if there's a way to pivot the business model from complete advertising focus to a partial subscription and then advertiser subsidized, I think that is therein lies the challenge. Quite a few companies are trying to do that. If you look at what Snapchat is doing, Snapchat has a Snapchat plus. They think they can get to 10 million users next year. Netflix is going that way. So there are a lot of web properties who are going either from advertising to subscription or the other way around YouTube is doing that. So it is challenging. It needs focus, but I think that's the right step. So there would be a balance and along the way, obviously, the biggest challenges to have stable user base, I think, given what Musk can do and probably bring back a few other power users. Without taking any names, I think that that should help with diversifying the user base and probably bringing back the polarizing views that Twitter brought to the table. One of those power users, Rohit, might be former president Trump. Musk has not was not keen on that lifetime ban for the former president. If he does bring back Donald Trump to the platform, do you think advertisers will flee completely flee the Twitter platform? It's hard to say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,36,2022-10-06 16:25:01
2718," Let's bring back Donald Trump to the platform. Do you think advertisers will flee, completely flee the Twitter platform? It's hard to say. I mean, what I would say is there would need to be a mechanism for advertisers to be able to choose where their ads are being shown. And in a way that their ads feel to be next to content that they view as brand safe. I think that's the bigger challenge. It is okay to have content that could essentially not be co-shared for a bunch of users, but so long as ads are not placed next to it, I think advertisers would be okay with that. So I think that's the bigger challenge from a product standpoint where can Twitter if they allow back users, if they let, if they just take out all this censorship, or at least the quasi-sensorship that the company has, can they essentially go back to advertisers and say, by the way, we can ensure that your ads are not placed to the content that you feel is not brand safe for you. And these are the ways that we are going to help you do that. I think that's the bigger challenge from a product standpoint. I feel it's a much bigger problem to solve even Facebook and even larger companies have not been able to solve it in a more convincing manner. So they've just chosen to shy away from that content itself. So if Musk brings back a whole lot of content like that, then there's a bigger challenge for the company to solve. MKM Partners, senior analyst, Roe Hit, Carl Carney, always good to see you. Great analysis. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. you You Oh, you're seeing crude oil prices jumping after OPEC plus agreed to cut production by 2 million barrels a day. That is higher than estimates. It's an attempt to boost prices in an already tight market. It comes amid reports of strong pressure from the White House to avoid such a move. Let's get some reaction. From Bob Iachino, Path Rating Partners co-founder and chief market strategist, Bob, you know, the OPEC plus spin will certainly be about this looking at global demand, but you know, we did have the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak at the seat in Vienna. So, you know, what do you make of what played out today? How much of this is really about the global oil picture? How much of this is politics? Well, I think with OPEC, you're generally getting both. I think that's pretty certain. I mean, obviously you can flip that around and say that the release of oil from the SPR is also about politics because we don't generally get those kinds of reactions to price increases. The release of the SPR was large when the largest in history and it didn't really, according to the Department of Energy, only reduce prices by somewhere between 25 and 40 cents a gallon at the pump. That's from the Department of Energy. Now, having said that, it was good timing. It got certain national averages on regular gasoline, for example, down to comfortable levels, but this does seem like a crack in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,37,2022-10-06 16:29:15
2719," timing. It got certain national averages on regular gasoline, for example, down to comfortable levels. But this does seem like a crack in the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia while OPEC Saudi Arabia, while OPEC plus made this decision. And you mentioned Mr. Novak sitting right next to Prince Abdul bin Salman, who was actually in that room that's very discouraging in terms of what can happen with the inflation picture going forward, especially ahead of the midterms. We've already seen a spike in oil futures here. I mean, what does this ultimately mean moving forward in terms of where energy prices are likely to go? We talk about OPEC plus Saudi Arabia and Russia, but obviously there's many other members who don't often meet their quota. Yeah, and I want to correct myself. I said, been Salman. It's Abdul bin Aziz. But from that perspective, when you're looking at where crude oil is going, I still think it's going to be weak. When you look at demand, given the potential recessionary picture globally, demand has been falling off a cliff. Now, some of the refinery utilization numbers that we've seen the recent fall has been because of Hurricane Ivan. We actually had about 12 refineries and drilling sites shut down into golf as a hurricane Ivan came through. Those will be reassessing and reopening and we'll see where utilization goes at that point. But OPEC is definitely the driving force in price given that U.S. production has reached about 11.8 million barrels and can't go much higher without capital investment, which we've seen really depressed over the last 12 to 18 months. So it is OPEC that's going to be controlling this price. But if we get the global recessions that are being predicted, they're almost assured in the UK and the EU, not quite the same here in the U.S., you're going to get a continued fall in demand. And because this particular cut is going to last all the way to December 2023, that's going to put a little bit of a crimp in the people who are looking for a Fed pauser or a Fed pivot because it's likely to drive inflation, at least stabilize inflation to higher levels. There is another catalyst looming in December when you've got those sanctions on Russian oil taking effect. Obviously, these headlines coming out of G7 countries saying they maybe want to try and phase that in to try and limit impact to the markets overall. But how much of that has actually already been priced in, you think? Well, I think a decent amount of it. Again, I was short crude oil prior to the leaks of OPEC potentially cutting by a million. My prediction was they were going to cut by a million and a half and be able to sort of go out into the public and say we're actually trying to help our allies as best we can by not cutting to million barrels. They didn't do that. They went ahead with the two million barrels. So from a perspective of what's going on with the future output of production, they've already been missing their current production quota. So this two million barrel cuts really only going to be about 800,000 to a million if they actually were to reach maximum here. So the length of it is disturbing to me. The length of time that they're going to do this because this means that they can do, they've announced they're going to have meetings every other month now, which prior to that, they said that they would be on a need to know basis. Every other month means they can adjust as both up or down and it seems like their target is more to adjust production down. I think OPEC wants to see a hundred dollar barrel crude oil. I still think we're going to see 65 before we see 100 in the WTI market. And finally, Bob, we've got the EU agreeing on a price cap for Russian oil. This is likely to take effect later in the year. But what's the impact on that? I mean, there's some who are skeptical who say this can actually be an effective policy. But what do you see in terms of this affecting price moves? Well, I'm one of those that's skeptical about that. I don't really think it can work in the way it's structured. It's based on insurance protections and Russia's already said they'll self-insure some of their cargoes going to India and China. It's interesting to see a production cut because it might actually slightly be targeting these caps. If there's a new production cut, then Russia can absorb most of it and not really have to worry about the price caps as they'll be able to get out what they can self-insure and leave the rest alone and not really be defying their commitment to OPEC Plus. I suspect that's why Robert Novak was in the room to discuss the effect of the cap and probably to make it less likely that it's going to work. Bob, I, at China, always get to get your analysis, path trading partners, co-founder and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,38,2022-10-06 16:34:02

Bob Iichino, always good to get your analysis, Pat Trading Partners, CoFounder and Chief Market Strategist. Well, millions of Americans hoping for student loan forgiveness are waiting for online applications to open this month, but the Biden administration's plan could cost more than 400 billion and could give higher earners greater benefits. Another issue is mounting legal challenges in recent weeks. Biden administration seems to have reacted to this with some scaling back of those measures. Let's bring in Mark Goldwine, he is SVP and Senior Policy Director of the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget. We're good to talk to you today. What steps the administration has now taken? We've got boroughs with privately held student loans no longer qualifying for relief. You've been quite critical of the initial announcement from the administration. What do you think is going to look like? Once we go through all these legal hurdles? The administration is playing legal lacumal right now. I think the issue is very likely the courts are going to rule this illegal if it comes to court. The administration is trying to prevent it from coming to court by making sure nobody has standing. Private lenders complain you prevent people from rolling over their consolidating their private plans. People that are in the income driven repayment plan plan you create an opt out. The administration is trying to cut off legal channels for people to challenge this in court, but if it does get challenged, I think there's a decent chance it's not going to make it. What do you mean when you say it's not going to make it? Are we talking about a complete cancellation of the program? That's a possibility. I'm not a lawyer in economists, but I can tell you how much this costs. The authority the president's using for this unilateral cancellation was really an authority meant to cancel that for troops coming back from Afghanistan. It wasn't meant for every single person of the pandemic. It's meant for people with financial hardship. I think there's a good chance courts are going to look at this and say the president overstepped his authority. Spending is really the authority of the Congress, not of the president. Let's talk about some of the criticisms when this first came out. You said that this would was largely targeted towards those at the top half of the income spectrum. 57% you say to 65% of the extended positive cancellation go to help those who are in the higher earning bracket. Has that thesis changed for you at all? As you point out, the administration has done this legal lacomal and tried to evolve the program. I don't think it's going to change that much. When we were just about canceling $10,000 per person, this plan was very regressive. The administration fixed some of that by basically doubling the cost for people that were on the Pell Grants program. But when we found it's still up to two thirds of the benefit will go to the top half. I don't think any of these changes are going to change it much. Over a lot of people that were in private loans or people that have been in default for a long time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,39,2022-10-06 16:37:53
2721," Still, up to two-thirds of the benefit will go to the top half. I don't think any of these changes are going to change it. Much, remember a lot of the people that were in private loans are people that have been in default for a long time and maybe just got out of it. And so I think they're going to look distributionally pretty similar. As you point out, since this policy was first announced, the administration has been hit both from the left, as well as the right with those saying it doesn't go far enough and other saying, this is just simply irresponsible. If, in fact, your thesis holds, and I realize you're not a lawyer, but these legal cases really come to try and halt the program in some way. What do you think should be done in terms of targeting those who have debt? Is there a way to go about this policy without the wider bracket that we have heard from the administration? More importantly, is there appetite in DC to pick up that discussion again? I hope that if the courts were the soleagle, we're out of money, we actually have to think. And I hope the administration will reach out to the relevant committees in Congress and actually work on legislation to focus on higher education costs and value themselves. Because that's the real problem. As tuition is continue to rise fast, the people aren't getting as much value for that tuition. There are also things we can do to improve, for example, the income driven repayment program to make sure that nobody's really, or that fewer people are really stuck with debt. But that's not going to happen with some kind of across the board cancellation. The current proposal, I think, is mainly got to just add a lot to inflation, drive up higher edged costs, and give a lot of windfall benefits to folks that don't really need it. Mark, I do want to ask you about another headline number that came out this week. Gross national debts are passing $31 trillion. We're talking about just $1 trillion being added in a nine-month span. Obviously borrowing is going up because of rates going up. What does this mean, ultimately, for the fiscal health of the country? Well, we're in big trouble. Look, we've the highest inflation rate in 40 years. That's in no small part because of these very high deficits we've been running. We also are headed towards record levels of debt, even as a share of the economy. We're going to be higher than World War II. And with the Fed now raising interest rates to try to fight inflation, there's a very real risk that debt becomes unsustainable. We face one of these interest rates spirals that just a year ago people were saying wasn't possible. Mark Goldwine, SVP and Senior Policy Director of the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget. Good to talk to you today. Joining us with more on all this is Maria Vettme. She's State Street Global Market Senior Multiaxid Strategist. Good to talk to you today. Walk me through this big reversal that we have seen. We started Q4 off with a big bang. And here we are today talking about a big sell off. Yeah, hi. I mean, for us, the kind of big rally we saw earlier in the week was a minute bit unexpected. We still have fairly barely bearish outlook on the market. So it could have been potentially a little bit over exaggerated reaction to some concerns for science of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,40,2022-10-06 16:42:17
2722," outlook on the market. So it could have been potentially a little bit over exaggerated reaction to some concerns for science of concerns about labor market. But I think it's important to kind of realize that we came to this to the date release in Joel's number in a very oversold position in risk assets, right? So Stokes been selling fairly consistently for good six weeks, dollars close to all time highs. We have a very difficult position in the market. So market was a very short risk. You have a number that suggests that labor market is potentially weakening. You can change Fed expectations and boom, you have this huge reaction. But on the kind of hindsight, what we see is that actually US economy may be showing first signs of labor market weakening, but there are a lot more to it. And kind of our overall kind of barricade comes from consumers still have money to spend labor market. We don't know whether it's that week after all. I mean, you're putting chart of participation rate. We know that people haven't come back to work to pre-covet level. So money is still there. So inflation problem is not so difficult to get very bullish in this market. Yeah, that is a long list of things that you just rattled off in terms of concerns weighing on investors right now. We've obviously got that big jobs number coming out on Friday. What's your expectation there? And what are we likely to see from the market if, in fact, it comes in a little weaker than expected? No, I think you're exactly right. So kind of risk reward is very, very asymmetric. So market really light stone to first Joltz number, which is, I mean, not the primary number in terms of economic numbers in general, but market was very, very encouraged and hopeful that we have seen some weakness from what FETO has already done and they don't need to be very, very aggressive. So should that be confirmed by week payroll number, I think the reaction would be really, really huge. If we see, I mean, we're probably not in a camp expecting a lot of weakness and should that come then we kind of continue to going down, but definitely outsized reaction on weaker payroll numbers. We've said that we're looking ahead to that November meeting for the FET. In the meantime, we've got earnings season really kicking off into high gear. How much of that is going to be the driver moving forward, at least in the short term? I mean, that was really interesting because so far this year because earnings almost didn't matter. So what has was driving equity markets is really those macroeconomic head fins and compression and multiples while earnings stayed, I mean, not not great, but still positive. So companies were producing profits. So up to now earnings didn't matter. We probably expect something similar. We still expect corporate earnings to be somewhat okay, not great. So trailing earnings exceeding reported numbers. Guidance will probably be weakish as we worry a lot about the management of worry about a lot about tighter financial conditions. So guidance will probably be weak, but it's really about policy. So I would probably still say that yes, earnings isn't important, but macroeconomic headwinds dominate.

2723," you pupu astronauts were sighing so they literally were seeing firsthand in both shave the stock price flight. They are looking then going crazy giving us these biggest oil cut that we've seen since 2020. We want to bring an Andy Lippau president of Lippau Oil Associates. Andy, it's great to see you again. So of course, the big question here is what this does to the price of oil. Goldman out this afternoon, raising its fourth quarter forecast, $110.00. A barrel saying that this is very bullish for crude. What do you think? Well, I think it is bullish. And we saw on Monday and Tuesday, the oil market react prior to the meeting and go up by $7 a barrel. And here we've added another dollar today on the back of the OPEC Plus announcement. The one thing that I would point out is while the production cut is advertised as two million barrels a day from their existing quotas, OPEC Plus is already producing 3.6 million barrels a day underneath their quotas. So the actual impact is more likely to be between 900,000 barrels a day and a million barrels a day. So then Andrew, in terms of the timing of this, could traditionally OPEC OPEC Plus, they do tend to stay the course in this. What do you think was perhaps the tipping point that led to this? Well, I think there's a number of things starting with OPEC Plus concerned about the world going into a recession, which in part was caused by high energy prices earlier this year when we saw crude oil prices rallied between $130 and $140 a barrel, as well as the high natural gas prices that we're seeing in Europe, which is causing a contraction and industrial output. So I think they wanted to take a preemptive step to reduce production in light of declining demand. I think another reason that they've cut production is to stabilize prices because they see a stronger dollar than higher inflation rates eating into their budgets. And we heard from the Biden administration shortly after this was announced saying that it will continue SPR releases as appropriate, also looking for additional tools to reduce the organization's control over energy prices. They talked about doing this with Congress. What does that potentially look like and entail? Well, there's very few levers that the government can actually do. If we want to reduce the price of fossil fuels, we need to get more of them out of the ground and the administration really hasn't been favorable to adopting those policies. One thing that has been discussed is perhaps limiting or banning the export of crude oil or refined products. But if we think about that, though we're part of the global market on crude oil, if we were to export less, some other place in the world, namely Europe or Asia would go without. On the refined products, we're exporting a significant amount down to Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, and the rest of South America, as well as Europe. So these policies in order to reduce exports and build inventories here have significant ramifications between the US and its allies. And so to that point, then, when you have these sort of shifting dynamics here, what does this do in terms of US influence on OPEC and OPEC Plus and who is OPEC and OPEC plus primarily then focusing on? Well, I think that OPEC Plus's decision is really showing the waning influence of the United States, and they're really snubbing their nose at the higher energy prices that are impacted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,42,2022-10-06 16:51:14
2724," decision is really showing the waning influence of the United States and they're really snubbing their nose at the higher energy prices that are impacting whether it's the US or the European Union. When we do look at OPEC plus, you know, we have the core OPEC 10, which excludes Iran, Libya, and Venezuela. And then we've got a number of countries outside of OPEC, the non-OPEC 9, which of course includes Russia. But at its core, the decision is really rest with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates in Kuwait, who are currently producing at their quota. And those are the three countries that were reluctant to increase beyond their quota to make up for the shortfalls from countries like Nigeria and Angola. This clearly is not what the White House wanted, what the Biden administration wanted the decision to be. And, of course, this comes amid concerns about a weakening economy. If we do see oil prices jump from here, if we do see $100 a barrel, I guess, how big of a hit do you see that potentially meaning then for demand? I guess, to what extent do you see demand falling off if we are back above $100 a barrel? Well, I think world-wide demand could drop, you know, one to two million barrels a day. Now, if we put that in context with really high natural gas prices in Europe, I think OPEC plus is fear and even deeper declines and demands, maybe three million barrels a day, which could really put oil prices under pressure. And so, Andy, how soon do you think we'll hit that $100 a barrel mark? In terms of the domino effect, when perhaps US consumers might start to feel the impact of that, how soon do you think that will happen? Well, I think these higher oil prices certainly prevent gasoline prices from continuing their seasonal drop during the winter. So, I would argue that the consumer at the gas pump is already going to be seeing the impact over the next couple of weeks. Also, we're going to see a greater impact on the diesel fuel price because that's really where the shortages are located, inventories in the US are at their lowest level for this time of year since 1996. The European Union is about to phase in their ban on Russian refined product imports in February and their buying seven to 900,000 barrels a day. And as diesel prices go up, the consumer is going to pay for it in the cost of goods and services that are delivered to their homes. Certainly putting more pressure on the Fed is they're trying to get inflation down as well. A big thank you, Andy Liffel, for joining us this afternoon. Mariner's played a playoff game. We were still renting movies from Blockbuster Video, including the first Harry Potter flick. It was 21 years ago and Friday, the longest postseason drought on American professional sports comes to a close.

2725," Oh, and Friday, the longest postseason drought on American professional sports comes to a close. Let's talk about it with Mariners president of Business Operations, Katie Griggs. Katie, great to see you. Your star player, Julio Rodriguez, had not yet turned one the last time this happened. How do you describe the excitement level in Seattle? I mean, it's palpable. It was incredible on Friday night, if you saw it on the faces of our athletes, and the fans, and the stands, and then basically homes throughout our region. I mean, it really was a moment of celebration for this city. Getting that monkey off our back was incredibly important, and now we can focus on bigger and better goals. You are clearly the lucky charm in your first year. Hopefully someday, you know, being the only woman president in Major League Baseball is not a big deal, but it is now with the only one that has that title. What do you want young women to learn from your rise to this point? I think it's a don't have to be anything unique. It really is important to be yourself. But with that being said, it's helpful to see someone like you, and know that, you know, that there are people that can do it, and therefore you can do it. I hope so. The journey has been an interesting one for you. You enrolled in North Carolina, stated 14. You went to turn our sports. You worked for the Atlanta United FC Soccer Club, and now the Mariners, what's the common thread throughout that journey? You know, I've been incredibly fortunate throughout my career to be surrounded by mentors who have helped support me as I try to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up. I never could have scripted the career path that I've been on. With that being said, I've really built a career around learning and trying to find places where I didn't have experience, get that experience and see where it took me, and I've been incredibly fortunate that it's taken me here to the Seattle Mariners. Yeah, you weren't really focused on baseball. You weren't necessarily a baseball lifer, so how'd you wind up as president of the Seattle Mariners? Baseball's always been a part of my life. I actually played Little League as a kid. My neighbor had a batting cage in his yard, and we were always out there playing. So it's been something that's been part of my life since I was little. The Durham Bulls are my team growing up and Raleigh North Carolina. So baseball's always been a passion of mine. With that being said, for me, it's about the fans. It's about how do we use sports to bring our communities together? And baseball, we have 81 regular season opportunities to do that throughout the year, and we're really excited here in Seattle to hopefully bring folks together many more times throughout the postseason as well. And because of all those games, it's probably the biggest challenge in bringing that fan experience because there are so many games. It's led to some interesting innovations with the Mariners and Amazon. Tell us about that. Yeah, no, for us, it really is about ensuring every single fan has an incredible experience. And one thing that anyone who works in sports or anyone who's been to a venue knows is lines can be a real challenge when you're bringing tens of thousands of people together on a game day. So with partnership with Amazon and their Just Walk Out technology, we rolled out a, what we're calling our walkoff market. At the beginning of this season, and it's something where our fans can swipe their credit card walk in, get food, concessions, some chotchkes, and then walk straight out and avoid the line altogether. And it's something that's, we've seen tremendous return so far. Oh, boy, what a huge difference. So it's not just you, the league is making some changes. They're adding the pitch clock to help that fan experience next year. How do you think that'll help from the fan experience? And what else can the game do to appeal to a younger audience? Yeah, I think, you know, they're making a lot of moves that I'm really optimistic. We'll ensure that that fan experience stays fresh and meets the needs of today's fan. With that being said, I think one of the opportunities we have, and you've seen it here in Seattle this year, you referenced Tuleo earlier, is really, we've got tremendously engaging charismatic athletes on our squad. And so for us, we recognize when you're looking at Gen Z, you're looking at Gen Alpha. This is a, these are cohorts that grew up on social media. They know what's real, they know what's fake. They care about authenticity. And so for us, it's how do we ensure that we're showcasing our athletes for who they are, the silly, the fun, the competitive, bringing that to life in a way that resonates with both current fans as well as people who haven't yet discovered their fans. Speaking of the silly and the fun, I don't know if you know about the Savannah bananas, they're an exhibition team down in Savannah. They have more TikTok followers in the Red Sox, Yankees, and Dodgers combined. Is there something that can be learned from what they're doing and applied to Major League Baseball? I think the Savannah bananas have done an absolutely phenomenal...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,44,2022-10-06 17:00:28
2726," He's in Dodgers combined. Is there something that can be learned from what they're doing and applied to Major League Baseball? I think the Savannah Banana has done an absolutely phenomenal job of creating an experience, right? And so when you're looking at this, what they're doing, they're bringing the fun back to the sport. And for us, whether you're looking at exactly how we do it, I suspect it'll look a little bit different, but whether you're looking at the celebrations that happen after a home run, whether you're looking at about celebrations that happen after a winter, the ways in which our athletes get along with each other, get along with our fans. A lot of that fun is something we focus on a lot in terms of bringing that to the forefront and ensuring that whether you're at the ballpark, you're watching from home or you're consuming on social media, you're getting a sense of that. So think with the Savannah Banana, you're doing his awesome. Another fan evolution is you took advantage of the work from home concept with work from the ballpark. Tell us about that and you see this returning. Yeah, we'd love to. I think it was something we saw tremendous and interesting in our marketplace, which was a lot of fun. Now we recognize people are doing all sorts of different things and are working from a variety of locations. And really this was an opportunity. We saw some folks who were here taking Zoom calls from Microsoft Teams calls from the actual ballpark itself. We also saw some people who were having team meetings there and bringing people together. It really is about how do we leverage the incredible asset we have here at Team Noble Park to ensure that we're creating an experience that works for everyone. And we know for day games, a lot of folks have to work. So if you got to work, we can give you a pretty cool backdrop to do it. Innovative and inflation proof. You guys are offering tickets and a meal for 20 bucks. How was that done at the major league level let alone on an expensive city like Seattle? Yeah, no, look, we are tremendously fortunate. We talked about the 81 regular season home games earlier. That means we have a lot of ability to welcome in our community. And we realize our community represents a lot of different people with a lot of different economic abilities. We believe we have an opportunity and obligation to be a place where everyone can come together. And that means we need to price things accordingly. So on our value games, we have tickets as low as $10 and you referenced our value menu, which we rolled out this year. For $3, you can have a refillable soda, a hot dog, popcorn, peanuts, red vines. It really is something where we're intending to ensure that all of our fans, regardless of who he's here, they are, can come, can have a good experience and can afford to come back again. All right, Katie, I promise you this. Seattle is coming out to the All-Star Game 2023 in Seattle to see all these innovations. We'll see you there, deal? Can't wait to host you all. All right, Katie Griggs, president of the Seattle Marinus. Congratulations, best of luck in the post season. Good to have you. Thank you. Thank you. You better take me with you on that trip. I promise, you will. I'm in. We'll set up some jobs. I'm in an easy sell, yeah. I like it. Maybe we'll do the show from there a few days. I like it. I like the bosses watching. In this episode of influencers, venture capital list and domain money CEO, Adam Dell. You can invest today in the banking system of tomorrow. And that's a very exciting investment opportunity for retail investors. If you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that appeals to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and couldn't be more proud of my brother, Boyd, he's done. Hello, everyone. And welcome to influencers. I'm Andy Surwer and welcome to our guest, Adam Dell, venture capitalist and the founder and CEO of a new trading platform, Domain Money. Adam, great to see you. Good to see you, Andy. Thanks for having me. I want to ask you all about domain money, but first of all, I've got to ask you about the crazy markets this year, both in crypto and in equities. What the heck is going on? Well, market volatility is one of the things that is inherent in our market, right? Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,45,2022-10-06 17:04:25
2727," is one of the things that is inherent in our market. Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital into a discrete number of assets, you're going to have significant swings. As Warren Buffett likes to say, the market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in long term. And as I look at the long term trends, some of the free cash flows, sources that are being spit out of some of the larger tech names. I'm quite bullish on their prospects going forward. And as it relates to cryptocurrencies where we're focused, I look at the fundamental underlying components of blockchain technologies and their contribution to our financial markets, less from a speculative standpoint and more from a core market function, a core financial function. If you look at, say, example, VISA, VISA moved about $10 trillion worth of transaction volume around the planet last year. Last year, Ethereum alone moved 11 trillion. And so that just gives you a sense of the scale of the impact of these technologies and what impact they will have on our broader economy. I'll give you another example. Money markets. A few years ago, the number of dollars involved in DeFi, money market protocols was less than a billion. That's a 2018 stat. This year, it's over 200 billion. And so the growth of the financial utility of these underlying technologies is undeniable. And as they become more widely adopted in commercial use cases, again, unrelated to speculation, I think you're gonna see a significant growth in real revenue and real cash flow coming out of these technologies. Yeah, I hear you, and I wanna ask you more about those technologies, but just sort of again, back to the macro environment, because, say, first of all, with the tech stocks, they've just been such winners in so many ways in our economy, but the driver here right now is higher interest rates. Does that concern you? Well, I mean, interest rates have been so low for so long that there's a whole generation of investors out there and market analysts who believe that this is the norm. And obviously, on a historical basis, interest rates don't stay this low. And so I think, given the true cost of capital and the fiscal responsibility that is incumbent upon responsible central banks to employ, interest rates inevitably need to go up over the long term. And with regard to cryptocurrencies, blockchain aside, people are talking about Bitcoin and they sort of positioned it, Bitcoin and Ethereum, other cryptocurrencies as either a hedge or not correlated to equities. But right now, it looks like those currencies are correlated to equities. What's your take on that? Yeah, I think that is a reflection of the maturity that the crypto markets are going through. These assets are now more broadly held across a larger institutional base. They're now held across a larger retail base. And so downward pressure in the macro market invariably will impact crypto as well. All right, let's switch over to domain money. Your new company is it pretty new and what is it? How old is it? So we launched today. Oh, that's good. January 25th. So we have thousands of customers on the platform today. It is a robust, sophisticated investment solution for both stocks and crypto. We provide a number of differentiated features that we think distinguish us from the market, achieve among them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,46,2022-10-06 17:08:06
2728," and for both stocks and crypto, we provide a number of differentiated features that we think distinguish us from the market. Chief among them is our signal product, which goes really deep down the data rabbit hole around the underlying fundamentals associated with these crypto assets. I'll give you a few examples. We analyze the Twitter firehose as well as other social channels and we provide a proprietary social sentiment score where we basically provide positive, neutral, negative ratings on the social sentiment of underlying assets. Another thing we do is we track the flow of funds on exchanges, so tracking the on chain and off chain activity of underlying crypto assets, which is indicative of sentiment and price volatility. A third thing we do is we track project health. We look at the overall quality of the management team, the number of GitHub submissions, and we present all of these insights to retail investors in a very consumable and easy to understand way. Those are some of the things that we are doing at Domain that are unique. What about the timing of this all, Adam? With the Fed, probably raising rates a number of times this year, we were in this incredible bull market, particularly during COVID, where there was all those stimulus checks coming into people's pockets and then they were going out to broker dealers and spending it. Are you heading into sort of a wind coming in your face? Yeah, well, short-term market swings are not really the thing that we pay a lot of attention to. We spend much more of our focus on the long-term trajectory of these assets. As I mentioned, there are some incredibly powerful forces that are driving real cash flow out of a number of the investment projects, the investment classes that we're looking at, particularly as it relates to DeFi protocols. We're very encouraged by the underlying trends that we see. A lot of people look at the price of Bitcoin or any given crypto asset over the last couple of weeks and say, gee, this doesn't look really good. I look at something very different, which is that a couple of years ago, there was virtually no transaction volume moving around the world to empower NFT transactions. Last year, it was 23 billion. A few years ago, less than a billion in DeFi volume, last year, 200 billion. 11 trillion in transaction volume on Ethereum. These are profound trends that are not going away just because of the short-term volatility in the financial markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,47,2022-10-06 17:12:20
2729," you you you you it in And speaking of those profound trends, Adam, and you mentioned, you worked at Goldman, you mentioned Visa, what does your take on these legacy institutions? Are they gonna get consumed by these trends? Or are they gonna co-opt them? I'm everyone I always talk about Visa and MasterCard or Dead because of electronic payments. And of course they benefited like crazy. But now there are questions about those companies, for instance. Yeah. Well, we've been honored that we were selected by MasterCard to be part of their smart path program. What I've seen from the Visa and the MasterCards of the world is they've really wrapped their tentacles around anything and everything related to blockchain technologies because they like many smart investors see the opportunity set and what it can mean for improving the efficiency of our banking plumbing. The bigger story though is what these technologies will do to allow consumers to both borrow and lend on their assets. That game is going to change profoundly because of blockchains and represents for consumers a real opportunity to make real yield on their assets or borrow at a much more market-driven rate rather than one available from their credit card or from their personal loan provider. We'd explain to us how that would work at them. Well, if you look on a number of the DeFi marketplaces where you can borrow and lend, you see rates that are much lower than what you would get from a credit card or from a personal loan provider out there in the market. But aren't those companies just trying to garner market shares and then a money-losing proposition or is the margin on crypto so much lower so that it is still profitable? Well, it's a true marketplace where rates are a function of what someone's willing to pay rather than a fair bit of regulatory constraints and controls that prevent true market rates from being accessible to anyone. You know, the average consumer can't access a money market in the same way that an institutional investor can. And crypto represents an opportunity for those markets to be opened up to anyone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,48,2022-10-06 17:16:17
2730," that access to money market in the same way that an institutional investor can. And crypto represents an opportunity for those markets to be opened up to anyone. That was the metaphor I was looking for. That's great. Okay, and speaking of regulation though, you provided me with a nice segue. The Biden administration is reportedly looking, I was reportedly preparing, I should say, an executive order for release coming up soon that will outline a comprehensive government strategy on crypto. Is it a good idea for the White House to get directly involved here? Well, we welcome and invite regulation into this industry because it's an important step in its maturity. You know, I'm, I'm, I point people to the fact that, you know, China's efforts to try to clamp down on this activity had virtually no impact on the overall value of the market or trading activity for that matter. And it just shows you that information wants to be free and markets want to be free. And so I think it's incumbent upon the United States as a leader, financial systems and financial markets to think, think through the policy decisions around what is a stable digital currency. How do we bring this nascent market into mainstream financial functions while at the same time protecting investors from the things that are scary and may not be as above board about this industry. And obviously in any new industry, those, those, those players emerge. You know, Andy, you and I remember the early dot com period where there were hundreds of companies many going public without clear business model or any line of sight to positive cash flow. And yet despite all of that noise, an enormously valuable set of companies emerged that redefined the very fabric of our economy. And the same dynamic will exist with blockchains and crypto. We're in the middle of a Cambrian explosion of diverse projects and initiatives that are being tackled by engineers using these technologies. And some subset of those will become the very building blocks of the next generation of our banking system. Would regulation impact domain money? We've worked hard to ensure that we are following the letter of the laws relates to regulation because we want to represent this industry as it matures rather than being part of the fringes of the wild, west of the industry. Right. My understanding, Adam, is that you said, quote, the notion that individuals are rational actors as a false one, they're emotional animals and they make financial decisions based on emotion. So is that true? Okay, good. Glad we got that right. To trading platforms like yours though, then have an obligation to protect users from themselves. Well, you know, I believe it's our obligation to inform the consumer and provide them with as much information as we can to educate them about making rational investment choices. We really stress on our platform, education, transparency, and time-tested investment strategies. So we talk a lot about dollar cost averaging. We talk a lot about portfolio theory. We talk about a lot about market fundamentals. What is the market size of this technology? What is the product market fit? What is the management team? What is the business model? And what is the viability of that business model over time? Rather than, you know, things that are meme and momentum driven. And so while I can't protect, you know, individuals from making bad decisions, I can help inform them. And so our goal is to achieve that for investors. I want to ask you about wealth inequality in financial services because of course, the wealthiest Americans still on the vast majority of equities. And it's probably true about crypto, although I'm not really informed. I'm just guessing maybe you know the answer to that as well. How do we address that? Is that anything?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,49,2022-10-06 17:21:13
2731," of equities. And it's probably true about crypto, although I'm not really informed. I'm just guessing, maybe you know the answer to that as well. How do we address that? Is that anything that concerns you, Adam? Well, the most interesting opportunity for blockchain technologies is opening up of markets to a broader set of our members of society that don't have fair access to a financial relationship that allows them to live their lives. Borrowing money, earning interest on deposits, those core components of our financial system are available to people who have bank accounts, who have credit scores. And blockchain's operate differently. They don't require there to be trust between the two parties to a transaction. And so they, as I mentioned earlier, represent an opportunity to open up those markets to a broader segment of our society and to make available to individuals who have fewer dollars, a fairer interest rate, a real yield on their savings, which they might not otherwise have access to. I mean, if you're a merchant in Taiwan and you have savings, how do you get yield on those savings? If you're a doctor in Nebraska and you have savings in your bank account, they're paying you 0.06%. That's not a market rate in terms of interest on your money. And blockchain's represent an opportunity to open those up to fair market rates and real market rates for each one of those individuals. Does that mean bad things for the legacy banks? I believe that the legacy banks are smart enough to acquire and partner and evolve their business models over time to embrace the changing nature of how financial entities make money. If you look at banking over the last 10, 15 years, it's been, it's very clear what's happened with the introduction of Dodd-Frank and other regulation, you know, interest rate competition has been introduced into the market. And so the revenue that banks have made from interest has basically been cut in half. In response, what they've done is they've basically doubled their fees. And so they nickel and dime the consumer on these little things that, you know, nobody pays attention to, but add up over time. Eventually that that game is going to run out and true market rates. What can you borrow for at what rate? What can you earn on your deposits at what rate? Those will be made available to consumers without the required on-ramp associated with, you know, establishing a bank account. You will be able to access those rates through DeFi protocols powered by blockchain technologies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,50,2022-10-06 17:25:15
2732," you you you you you you you do you you do you or as we wrap things up here I got to ask you some personal questions, and of course that means I got to ask you about Michael your older brother Michael Dell CEO of Dell what was it like growing up with with Michael and what about it do you think contributed to the success of both of you guys your household? Well my mom used to like to say that she had three boys and she left out food for two. You know, Michael was always a young man in a hurry. He was always tinkering with something, doing something, working on something and he was pretty good at figuring things out. And so, you know, I've been very fortunate to have a front row seat to one of the great entrepreneurial success stories in our country's history and couldn't be more proud of my brother and what he's done. Right. Okay. So, you're still working with him. I mean, you're in touch with him. You guys talk, what's your relationship like today? We talk a lot and I just saw him and he's doing well and working hard and enjoying his role as the CEO of Dell. Yeah, and it's just watching that kind of come and not go, but it's sort of had these different chapters, I guess, is how you characterize it, right? Yep. All right. And so, you've now found it a bunch of successful companies, your self-addom and you've sold some to different entities. What have you learned and what are some mistakes you've made, what are some things you've learned along the way? Yeah. Well, you know, one is that if you are solving a fundamental problem with a technology solution that appeals to the end customer, that's a pretty good formula. And so, I've tried to focus on finding market problems and solving them with technology. The second and this won't be any deep insight, but it's all about the team and the quality of the people around the table trying to solve the problem you're trying to solve. And so, I really focus on that. I'm very proud of the team we've put together at Domain Money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,51,2022-10-06 17:29:17
2733," the table trying to solve the problem you're trying to solve. And so I really focus on that. I'm very proud of the team we've put together at Domain Money, about 25 of my former colleagues from Goldman Sachs chose to join me in this new adventure. And in addition to those folks, we've hired Brad Olson, who was the head of content for seeking alpha, the head of trade-offs from Kenneth Fitzgerald. We hired a COO who ran the crypto business for SOFI. We've established a really solid team that is very focused on our mission, which is to build our customers wealth. You have a metaverse part of it or no? Well, we will bring additional assets onto the platform over time. I think you'll see us getting into the NFT space sooner rather than later. And so customers can look forward to that. In the coming months. All right, let me know when you get the metaverse thing down. Okay, I'll add that and go into Domain Money. Final question Adam, how do you see using your influence on this world? Well, I don't know how much influence I have other than, I like building things. I like catalyzing teams around specific objectives and goals and trying to motivate and set direction there. It is very fun for me to build things. I genuinely enjoy it. I get a real rush out of creating something and then having people use it. And so I'm very focused on making sure that we deliver the best investment platform experience in the market. I remember when Goldman was working on the Apple card and there was chatter among the industry and even within the halls of Goldman Sachs, what does the world need another credit card for? And if you've ever used the Apple card, it's really a delightful, unique experience. And I think the same opportunity exists in investment platforms where there are real improvements that can be made in the customer experience, the customer support, the education process, the journey that we take customers down as we help them try to make better investment decisions. And so I'm very focused on that as well as the rest of the team. Adam Dell VC and founder and CEO of Domain Money. Thanks so much for your time. Andy, thanks for having me. You've been watching influencers. I'm Andy Sirwork. We'll see you next time. You've got talent..... Welcome back to Y'all of Finance. I'm Brian Sausie here with Julie Heimann and Brad Smith. Markets are tiptoeing into Friday's crucial jobs report. It's seen some mixed action across the board amongst the major indices. But for right now, at this particular moment in time, all three major indices in the red. Julie, over to you with some breaking news on a market, you follow very closely. Alright. See this morning's Karai Sabigraad.ป Section",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,52,2022-10-06 17:35:08
2734," But for right now at this particular moment in time, all three major indices in the red. Julie, over to you with some breaking news on a market. You follow very closely that is mortgage rates. Well, now I do like everyone 6.6% 6.66% is now the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage according to Freddie Mac that information just coming out. It is a very, very slight improvement over the 6.7% that we talked about last week as Freddie Mac, so Chief of Godness points out rates remain quite high compared to just one year ago. Meaning housing continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers. This is something that we have talked a lot about the real world implications of having these higher mortgage rates that are more than double where they were a year ago. The people are just going to pay a lot more over the life of the mortgage. It also means by the way that housing prices are starting to come down as a result because of someone is paying overall more for financing the house than what's got to give in many cases it's the home prices and the demand that we have seen also has been falling to some extent. Yeah, it continues to be more expensive for potential home buyers here. Freddie Mac also noting that they're going to make some enhancements to their market survey really improving and looking at some of the collection quality diversity of data use. It seems like kind of mirroring what we had seen from ADP earlier. This year of the summer this is a time to really get a better sense of how accurate the data still is and still as of right now for some of these rates it does still point to what we all expected and still some home buyers are experiencing is the higher rates that they're having to pay for an extended period of time which is kind of barring out. And it's just the average if your credit isn't up to snuff. Right. You're paying way more than this. Maybe last year at this point if your credit wasn't good what maybe you pay five or six percent now what do you eight nine ten. One thing to point out is people do refinance their mortgages right. So if rates do if you buy a house at this rate and then rates go down then you can many people can then refinance. So that is one little more positive tone here. All right. Let's talk about the implications of all of this and the implications of higher rates on the economy overall for that we bring in Kenneth Rogoff. He is professor of economics at Harvard University is joining us now Ken. Thank you so much for being here first of all. Here is sort of a very visible real world impact of Fed policy right. The rate the rate increase that we have seen in mortgages specifically in the effect that the knock on effect that has on the housing market. What do you think overall about the effectiveness of Fed policy with fighting this current bout of inflation? Well, we haven't had them fight about of inflation in a very long time. So whatever models we had you know we have to dust off and see. I think we know that their long lack of facts hits the markets very quickly. It's equity markets more slowly housing markets but things like employment that the peak effects can be a year off. So it's very hard. You know it's one of the things that makes it so hard for the Fed to get to a soft or softish landing which I'm pretty skeptical about. Okay. So with your skepticism about getting to a softish landing what would the reality of the economic detriment incurred be if we were to see what many economists are calling for a recession in mid 2023? Well I mean I think it could be pretty brutal if the Fed really is hellbent on having inflation come down as quickly as possible to two or two and a half percent. We have Europe very likely going to recession China. It at least a growth recession by all measures for the amorous session. That's a lot of pressures on us. The dollar is very strong and interest rates are rising very fast. So I think the idea that it's going to be a really mild recession if that would be lucky. I say it could be a tough tradeoff for the Fed once the numbers start setting in. I'm a little worried that having gone the wrong way in one direction with the change in their framework and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation. They're now going in the other direction and possibly moving to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,53,2022-10-06 17:38:49
2735," and not looking at the unemployment and what that was saying about inflation, turn out going in the other direction and possibly moving too fast, given the long legs. Professor, if the economy does get brutal, like you just suggested, do you think this is a Federal Reserve at some point next year that is back to unwinding these aggressive rate hikes they've been taking recently? So here's the thing, yes, but I think where we're gonna land at the end of this and now I'm looking maybe two years ahead, is that a level of interest rates higher than we're used to, even after inflation comes down. The real interest rate, the premium of the interest rate over the inflation rates, been extraordinarily low since the financial crisis. Some people say it's secular, stagnation, demographic, low productivity inequality, what have you. I think if you look at a long horizon, in fact it was abnormally low in that period and we're gonna get some moving back to being, meaning that interest rates, even when they start coming down, they not come down all that much. So how do we then determine what the sort of natural or stable rate should be, right? Is there any way of sort of gaming that out what that could look like? Very tough. My own research sort of speaks to the 10 year rate, which I think will end up at a higher place than we've been used to before the pandemic. But what's going on with the Fed funds rate, with all the regulation and the financial repression, is a little hard to say. So they really have no idea that's one of the things making it difficult. But if you're asking, I think it'll be higher than we're used to. For consumers right now, what should they be navigating, how can they best navigate perhaps, even leading into the scenario that you've described? Well, I mean, it's a tough picture where probably headed towards a difficult situation coming out of a difficult situation. Certainly I think employment is the key. Everybody's been particularly young people who've been moving jobs every six months or a year. They better think twice about that in this period when it might not be so easy to land on another job. Can I want to switch gears a little bit? Because you focus not just on the US, but on the globe as well. And you and some others are just out with some really interesting research on the real estate market in China. Now, so much attention on the sort of zero COVID policy and the negative effect that's having on China. But there's some underlying risk here that you illustrate in this research. We're looking now, you look at so-called Tier 3 Chinese cities, some of the smaller cities, although still pretty large, and that there's this excessive housing stock and that there's been really a sharp slowdown in prices and housing prices in those areas. What kind of risk is this presenting for the Chinese economy? Well, I think it's a huge long-term problem with or without the zero COVID policy. Housing real estate more generally, commercial real estate infrastructure has been the go-to policy for China. I did some research a couple of years ago, peak China housing, showing all the factors that suggested we really have come to an end of it. And more recently, my co-author and I've shown that a lot of that is concentrated in the more hidden Tier 3 cities, the Cincinnati's of China, so to speak. But they out, like we say, the Cincinnati's of China could be five and 10 million people. I'm like, maybe Cincinnati's of a few hundred thousand. And on top of that, there are a lot of them. They account for 60% of GDP. You don't see it that people travel to the big cities, they're less visible, but they really have a problem where they've been building like crazy and are sort of getting to the end of the line of that development strategy. And it's not that easy for them to pivot. And so what then happens when we do see China coming out of zero COVID at the same time that the rest of the globe is slowing down or even entering recession. I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,54,2022-10-06 17:43:09
2736," on or even entering recession. I mean, do we see sort of a circular effect here where China's troubles maybe exacerbate the troubles of the rest of the globe? Oh, China's been enormously important for the rest of the globe. It counted for, I don't know, like a quarter of all global growth over the decade before the pandemic may be going into the first year, at least according to the IMF. And those days are over. I think we're looking at much slower growth in China, who knows what the real numbers are, but much slower growth in China for years to come. And of course, it matters. I mean, it hits commodity exporters, the hardest, that they have a raracious appetite for commodities, but European luxury car makers, et cetera. I think it's going to have a very big effect. And that's even without the Ukraine war and whatever happens there and which side China and so on. Can Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University? Thanks so much for the insights and the forecast and calculations, all of it, great conversation. Guys, let's get to yeah, we'll finance this. And as for right, we're at the Wi-Fi Interactive with a look at what's taking place here on the day. And as we're tracking. And you guys were just talking about those markets, right? And just looking at the home builders, we did see a little bit of action here with some of these home builders that had been in green territory. Now losing some of that steam, I just want to also pull up a year-to-date chart so you can see how much these home builders have lost year-to-date. Looking at the sector action, we are seeing the markets down right now. So you're looking at utilities and also real estate, which are moving to the downside. You've got energy, though, that is still in green territory. And over on the NASDAQ 100, some of these mega caps that had been in green earlier are now a bit under pressure in video had been up more than 1% earlier. Now losing some steam. Also looking at some of what's happening with our trending tickers, because we've got two trending tickers that we should mention on our trending ticker page. Well, that's the oil right now. But you can see also the US dollar index by the way going a little bit higher. That is putting pressure on stocks. And on those trending, we are seeing Pinterest that's trending right now. Number one on our Yahoo Finance page, that's after that Goldman call. But also, want to check out Costco because Costco's September sales came in higher than expected. So you're looking at those sales that increasing for Costco. And the stock right now up more than 1% year to date also outperforming the broader markets because that's Chuyi. But year to date Costco down 14%. Still outperforming the broader markets, you can tell consumers still want to get value big bulk. They love Costco. I love those hot dogs. And it's for a Thanksgiving chewy. I appreciate it. Because we're here before we had to break. You saw on that board, and it's highlighted Chuyi. Let's put a spotlight on the impressive week so far for shares of Chuyi. Stock is up close to 20% on the week. We're seeing it add to gains a little bit here on the early going. Dusting the NASDAQ composites 5.5% gain. The online pet retailers stock got a big boost on Wednesday, especially into the clothes as data from investment research outfit Yippet found Chuyi sales trending above expectations for the current quarter. We will note that Chuyi in late August, slashed its full year sales outlook by a couple hundred million dollars. And the stock got absolutely covered. I'm sorry, I was just going to say, I just bought some canned dogs on Amazon versus Chuyi. Oh, really? All right, let's take a discussion offline. Very interesting about that. All right. All right, coming up, supply chain rows are trickling down to the price of Ford's hot selling, electric pickup truck, the F-150, Julie's back with the latest business headlines. I'm the other side of it. All right. All right. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,55,2022-10-06 17:47:32
2737," Patreon.yGirls.com Let's get down to business now with some other headlines we're watching. Uber's former security chief Joseph Sullivan has been found guilty of obstructing an FTC probe for failing to report a 2016 data breach to authorities. Prosecutor said he took steps to cover up the incident, classifying the hack as a bug bounty rather than a data breach. Sullivan's legal team said that after the hacker signed non-disclosure agreements, the security chief felt the incident did not need to be reported. The Sullivan now faces a five-year prison sentence for obstruction, and up to three years for failing to report a felony. That data breach, by the way, occurred during Travis Kalinick's term as CEO, where top performers were often given a blind eye. Meanwhile, General Electric is restructuring the company laying off workers at its offshore wind unit as it grapples with weak demand, rising costs, and supply chain delays according to reports. The cuts are expected to affect 20% of the offshore wind unit's US workforce, which equates to hundreds of workers, wind has been GE's largest and most profitable renewable business, but the expiry of renewable energy tax credits took a big toll on demand. And Ford is raising the price again for its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck. It's the second time in the last couple months. The chief is versioned, now retails for just under $52,000 bucks. It's roughly 30% increase from the original starting price of about 40,000 with first wind on sale in May. Ford said in a statement, the increases on the result of ongoing supply chain constraints, rising material costs, and other market factors. Soz? Twitter shares continue to trade below Elon Musk's $54.20 offer price, as there's still fears on a deal getting done. Let's get more on this with cities, senior analysts, Ron, and Josie Ron. Good to see you here. Just based on your knowledge of the situation, folks, you have talked to, do you still think this deal gets done at that price? You know, we were pretty, the big news this week was around coming together, both parties suggesting with Elon saying we will, on our original $54.20 share offer, and Twitter come out, it's coming out specifically, and saying that it's something that we are looking to do as well. And so the fact that they're both negotiating table, not in court going against each other, I think that's a positive step. And it seems to me, it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,56,2022-10-06 17:52:23
2738," So me, it's just a matter of time until something happens in this deal seems to be on the path to being consummated. So that would be our view overall. What's the reality of any changes that would be made to Twitter and when that would actually take place, even if and as this does kind of continue to work its way through? Yeah, I mean, if something were to happen, meaning that if it is acquired by Mr. Mosk and if we go through and it's a now private company, look, unfortunately, this has been in the public world now that this acquisition back in force since called it March or April, I believe, with the initial deal, initial offer there. And so Twitter's gone through quite a bit of change from then until now, not only from a business perspective with advertisers potentially pulling back maybe getting a little bit more nervous, some placing ads on Twitter, in addition to the macro changes that are happening out there, but then internally, you know, that there's just a lot of concern in our view around morale, around basically attrition or just getting things done in new products being launched. So your question of how long would it take to sort of get the business back up to speed? Frankly, you know, it would take probably some time to rebuild and the macro environment doesn't what would not help in the current environment where advertising continues to be a little bit of a softer subject overall. And Ron, we don't even know what he's going to do with the company, right? I have to say, man, it must be tough analyzing this company right now. You didn't know if the deal was going to get done. You don't know what Elon's going to do if he does indeed consummate the deal, right? I mean, we've gotten some hints dropped. There's been a lot of speculation. Trump's going to come back. He's talked about this, everything app X, whatever. But like, how do you, how do you even model concretely in a situation like this? Well, it'll be a lot easier for them internally as a private company, so you wouldn't have to talk to folks like myself to model and figure out what's next. But you essentially have to rebuild the business, right? So you start, I'm sure the first order of business is to look at the product to your point, see what can be done to make it more user friendly, to get more users on the service, onboarding with something that was a big focus prior to this saga that we're in currently. And so number one would be product. Number two then is figuring out how you best monetize. And right now the model is primarily advertising, but of course there's options around subscription, there's options around maybe payments or something along those lines purchases. So there's different things you can do. But I think day one, whenever this comes to a conclusion, has to be let's focus on the product, let's make sure it becomes that, call it town square, open free marketplace, and then everything else should follow. But it's not something that I think happens overnight. It's likely to take some time. Ron, is there an appetite in the marketplace for this super app concept that Elon is pushing here? Do consumers want to, let's say, go into Twitter, tweet then also maybe get taken to trade some stocks on XYZ platform, and then order an Uber, and then a hamburger for dinner. I mean, do people really want that? Yeah, it's interesting. The super apps here in the West haven't really taken on as much as they have, taken off as much as they have over in Asia and other parts of the world. And so that definitely is a TBD overall. Partnerships to allow things along those lines that would build off of what you see on Twitter make sense. You can see that happening. But one super app, it's a change in use case, right? And the thing with Twitter that haven't covered the company for a while now and looking at it quarter in, quarter out, the number one thing is a product be those monetizable daily active users. And so the more you can do to get those users on board, everybody knows Twitter. What's always surprising is you would think it would have a bigger footprint overall. And so that's the, in terms of users. And so that's probably the job number one. And if the super app does that, that's a big question. But frankly, it's still too early to even offer that. And I think you're right. It would have to be something that would at least be in line to what you are looking for and consuming while on Twitter. And there's partnerships that can make that happen. But it's definitely, I would say, the product is that's on the roadmap for down the road once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all of the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,57,2022-10-06 17:56:30
2739," for down the road once everything settles for the most part. Is it possible that after all of the dust is settled, that Twitter in privacy becomes a media company? And I mean a media company with partnerships that can actually charge people for the ability to watch video content, whether that be from the WMBA, whether that be live sports or the partnerships with even some of the entertainment companies that they've worked with over the past, creating kind of a charging premise based on that, where the social connectivity just becomes an extra add-on on top of that. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do with the platform when you have as many monetizable DAUs that are out there. I would say, and we've always talked about the content on Twitter is amongst the best out there, and the content is really just an amalgamation of what people are saying and doing and tweeting and whatnot. And you can get lost in Twitter for hours, the challenges that product providing those details on what you're looking for, going more on a media strategy, working with providers and partners. We've seen success in that, right? And I think Twitter in the past has had partnerships by providing videos and highlights from the Olympics, from the NFL, from many different sports teams, as well as award shows and whatnot. So I think going down the media path is something that would continue. The question is, the model changes from primarily advertising to maybe some sort of subscription. That's a TBD. And I would say most entertainment companies on the web that have gone the paying for content, it's not an easy sort of chasm or bridge to cross. And so you really need to provide that value to get users to subscribe to it. And right now, again, Twitter has some tremendous and fantastic content in there to matter surfacing it and providing that right user experience on a personalized level. And naturally, the key thing going forward, the personalization. Well, Ron, unfortunately, I think this is the first time we've talked to you about Twitter. Unfortunately, maybe it'll be the last of this deal goes through. Although perhaps it'll be a relief for you. I don't know. We'll find some other good stocks to talk about with you, though. Thanks so much for coming on, cities, senior analysts, Ron, Josie appreciate it. Thanks for having me. Coming up, Europe's natural gas crisis and focus as the E remains divided on how to tackle rising energy prices will have the latest on the other side. we have here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,58,2022-10-06 18:02:07
2740," the This morning, Swedish investigators confirmed suspicions of many, saying that the recent leaks in the Nordstrom gas pipelines from Russia to the EU were caused by detonations. Now they don't say who was responsible for those detonations, but nonetheless, they say the preliminary investigation has, quote, strengthened the suspicions of serious sabotage. Let's talk about the natural gas dynamics in that area and indeed around the globe. For that, we're joined by Goldman Sachs head of natural gas research. That is Samantha Dart. Samantha, it's good to see you again. So we got this report this morning. I, again, it sort of confirms what a lot of folks had suspected. I don't know if it changes in your mind the calculation, the risks to supply, knowing indeed that it was detonations that caused those leaks. It doesn't really, we already expected it and I think this is pretty much consensus that Nordstrom one or Nordstrom two for that matter would not flow gas to Nordstrom gas. Not only now, but going into next year as well. So our Nordstrom gas balance is remained the same. Okay. And so, I mean, for those of us who are still trying to admittedly wrap our heads around this fully, I mean, the price impact that this would have towards the end users, the end consumers of this natural gas as well. Yeah. So, what the region is having to deal with is a massive lack of supply, right? This has been already established since the close from Russia have been curtailed and increasingly curtailed over the course of this year. As a result, we have seen prices skyrocket to 10 times or more, their 10-year average. And we expect them to remain elevated going forward. Now sequentially, it's a bit tricky because over the course of the winter, actually if winter temperatures are close to average, we expect prices to drop a little bit and bring a little bit of relief because you have enough storage to deal with that deficit. Now go and eat you next summer, yes, we still expect extremely elevated prices over 230 euros summer next year. Samantha, your colleagues over on the oil side of the equation raised their forecast for Brent, I know. If oil prices start to trend back up higher, will we see an uptick in natural gas demand? Or is that demand just kind of firmly capped by the price action we've seen on that side? So you're right that under this surprisingly bullish op-at-cut that has been announced, the balance for oil looks even tighter. And as our colleagues highlighted, you still have the risk of potentially a $30 per barrel spike to oil prices from here. Now even taking that into account, natural gas is still so expensive that it would continue to provide an incentive for users to substitute actually away from that natural gas and into oil. So one interesting anecdote that we've been seeing, especially going into this winter, is that now this gas to oil substitution is not even just about the power generation sector, but it's also happening starting to happen in the industrial sector where some users, instead of buying incredibly expensive natural gas, they're opting for using oil in their boilers instead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,59,2022-10-06 18:04:41
2741," probably expensive natural gas, they're opting for using oil in their boilers instead. Samantha, if we do in fact go into a more prolonged recession or economic slowdown, where do you see prices for natural gas going? So the interesting thing about this slowdown that we are seeing, especially in Europe, is that it's being caused by the lack of natural gas. So think about it this way. We don't have the normal supply of natural gas. So the only way to manage storage, the only way to guarantee that we're not going to face blackouts in the winter is to curtail demand. So this is why prices have been so elevated. And as a result, yes, we're seeing aluminum producers cutting back, fertilizer producers, gas, I'm sorry, cement, glass, refineries. So industrial activity is indeed slowing and bringing Europe into a recession because of the lack of natural gas. So this is what needs to happen until this deficit in gas is resolved. Goldman Sachs head of natural gas research, Samantha Dart, always good to see you. We'll talk to you soon. Coming up, Guggenheim is calling this company its best idea into 2023. Now time for our call for the day. Despite Nike's inventory lows in margin pressure, Guggenheim is feeling good about the sneaker giant. The investment bank is maintaining its $135 price target and by rating on the Athlete's make or calling it its best idea into 2023 or another way of looking at this. They're saying just do it. I could not get it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,60,2022-10-06 18:08:28
2742," decision that gets triggered from there, then Pinterest perhaps can maintain some of that fanfare among its new consumers, and that triggering a better average revenue per user on the site too. I like this note, and one reason why I like it is because I was at that Goldman Sachs conference. I saw Eric working in the room, and I saw the Pinterest team there. So this is a very thorough, I think, well thought out report by Eric Sheridan, who came on with us at the event, talked a lot about the headwinds that tech is facing right now, but there's a lot of expectations now built into Pinterest, and I think a lot of that rests on New CEO Bill Ready, delivering against some of these expectations, and I would just caution investors that it might take a couple quarters to see his vision play out on the top and bottom lines of Pinterest. Those shares are actually downless this year than I would have expected. All right, let's talk about, and speaking of shares that have been going down, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan upgrading the stock from underweight to neutral citing a positive impact from the Lenders reported restructuring plan. You can see the shares are bouncing a little bit today. They're up just about 1% in US trading, that is. Of course, they also trade in their native Switzerland, and JP Morgan, it's a pretty wonky node here, but basically they're outlining two scenarios. In the first scenario, a dramatic restructuring of the bank with a 70% shrink in its investment banking operations and exit from fixed income commodities and currency trading and equities trading. So that would indeed be a big change in that scenario. Their tier one capital ratio would actually stay the same according to JP Morgan. In the second scenario, they assume yet another half-hearted investment bank restructuring and they seem to be a little bit less positive on that particular scenario. So still some scenarios for Credit Suisse to sort of pull through this without needing to raise additional capital, I guess, is kind of the bottom line here by selling shares. This is a good bedtime read. Yeah. Oh, the realtor is. Hey, the Nike guy died, right? They just do OK. All right, before we get... Giving people information. Well, you know what, here's the thing. Nike is then great. Pinterest, maybe they'll do better, and Credit Suisse, we'll see what they do. Guys, coming up on the other side of this show break. We've got our, well, we've got much more here on Yahoo Finance. Including, well, we don't have the fan who caught Aaron Judges' 60-second home on ball. But guess what? He's fielding offers upwards of $2 million. We've got more on the other side. Yeah. Good afternoon. Yeah, good afternoon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,61,2022-10-06 18:16:12
2743," seven you Slava, Debase. Time for Cup of Time. Three stories, one minute each. We start with this today. People still want their Costco hot dogs and bulk groceries, despite rising prices. Costco reported another strong month of sales. For September with net sales, up 80 or 8.5%, 80.5% year over year. This despite same-store sales, dipping on lower gas prices. All right. You're taking a look at some of the comps, up 8.5% year over year, 4 Costco. People still want it. You love it. You like saying about this hot dog? I will refrain from saying something funny on the hot dog. And I'll say this, it was good to see prices decelerate in September versus August. So another little sign that inflation in a lot of these everyday categories that a Costco grocery stores you name it, is starting to roll over a little bit. And that's a good thing. I think for consumers spending into the holidays. I will say, I think they recently said that they're not going to raise their membership price yet. You're predicting one that was made. It's coming, it's coming. It is. Yes. And the gold. It's not like it's not coming this year. They waited me the last minute, but it's going to be a big earnings driver for that company. Yeah. And I mean, comparatively, Costco, BJs, Sam's Club, underneath of Walmart, all of them had been trying to cozy up to the consumer, especially in the bulk buying boom. That would say. Indeed. All right. Uber is reviving itself driving vehicle plan after selling its autonomous driving research division. Uber signed a 10-year deal with an emotional to add self-driving cars to its vehicle lineup. The self-driving cars would work for both Uber and Uber Eats and several U.S. cities upon launch. Still no details on where, where that will be. And, you know, I recently saw some of my first self-driving cars out in San Francisco. I know some, you know, going to New York, going to another place. And I think it was a ZUX. I just can't see how these are the future. I still have a driver behind them. And I still ordered Uber. I didn't order a ZUX, but they look cool. And that's all you got for me. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like it's really early stage. I mean, regulations, like nothing is there yet. Yeah. I've interviewed the CEO of ZUX and the founder of ZUX before. And, of course, all of those companies that you kind of lumped together there between ZUX, between Waymo, and then even for Uber and some of their driverless technology, it's all going to be dependent upon how well they're also able to license that out to some other companies. That want to take advantage of it in the future too. But, again, a lot of red tape that they've got to get through. And then, additionally, when you think of the customer, and how this is able, going to be able to cut down costs for the customer as well as the company, operating costs per mile, north of a dollar. This could perhaps bring it below 40 cents. Yeah. All right. And a big payday for the lucky baseball fan who caught Aaron Judges, that Aaron Judges ball. The ball estimated to bring in $2 million at auction, as of now the Dallas-based man that caught the ball has not decided what he wants to do with it. He could give it back to Judges and the Yankees, or he could sell it himself. Another unknown is taxes. The IRS has yet to come in, but some experts speculate catching the ball could count as a taxable... Isn't this guy a millionaire? That's what I was told by our team. I don't know anything about him. Oh, good for him. So then, is it a capital gains tax because you paid for the... Sounds like he could afford it....to go to the game. And then now your return on that is you actually got a good bet off. I mean, I just think it's fascinating that the regulations are such that when you catch a ball, it becomes your property. And one of our producers, Connor Hickey, was explaining to us, it's written on purpose that way, because it absolves them of liability if you are injured by something flying, right? Whether it's a bat or a ball or whatever it may be. I think Connor owns a lot of Mickey Mantle rookie cards, so he's sitting on that ball. So he knows a lot about that. Okay. Alright, guys, coming up next, we're going to talk a little Tesla. Stick around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,62,2022-10-06 18:20:29
2744," Now there's a lot about that. Alright guys coming up next. We're gonna talk a little Tesla, stick around. Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to make headlines surrounding the Twitter acquisition. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla, T-S-L-A. Tesla's shares are moving lower on the day by 1.2% of the shares. Around the tech-tightened sales of Tesla shares to finance, deal making coupled with whether he might be too distracted to hit targets at Tesla. Just one point, for regulatory reasons, So Is Elon Musk too distracted to run Tesla. Frankly, Tesla's his baby. This company is a great expression of his personality and he has shown tremendous capability to manage many different things, nerling the boring company, SpaceX, and other outside ventures. And the intellectual curiosity necessary to execute pretty well there. So will it possibly take time away from Tesla? Yes. I think the question that probably needs to be asked is will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And I'm not the best judge of that. I think you already have some pretty clear ideas on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,63,2022-10-06 18:25:33
2745," is will he be giving enough time to Twitter? And I'm not the best judge of that. I think he already has some pretty clear ideas on Twitter and he does have a history with PayPal and the digital payments space, which I think is part of his vision on fixing that asset. So it doesn't bother me for Tesla. I have other reasons that I'm very bearish on company, but I have tremendous respect for what they've done. Well, we'll get to those reasons in a second, Craig, but does it even matter if Elon is distracted? Who cares? And I mentioned that because we have EV tax credits in play that are probably going to be a big tailwind to Tesla and then we have cars that people just really seem to be obsessed about. Yeah, I mean, they've done each for a menace job, right? They've basically made the automotive industry sexy again. The last time it was sexy was the 1950s. That was when it's had come out of the best universities in the world and say, oh my gosh, I want to work for a car company. Now, those same kids are coming out and saying, I want to work on electric vehicles. I want to work on future drivetrain technologies. Elon Musk deserves a lot of that credit because it's his vision and his commitment that's allowed that to take place. Does it matter? Does it really matter for Tesla so much? Not really. The flywheel is rolling, it's running. And they have very different issues to manage through over the next couple of years than what they've had to challenge through to date. And whether or not Elon Musk is the one that's the right person to make those decisions, we'll find out. I'm skeptical. I think there's some very challenging things ahead for this company. And if Musk is maybe reducing his intensity with the company, it might not be a bad thing. Craig, I know there's no imminent changes at the top of Tesla, but is there anybody else there who could run the thing besides him? Oh gosh, that's a tough question. I don't think so. I mean, I've talked to a lot of former Tesla executives. I know people that have turned down positions at Tesla that are leaders and they're respect to various. It's a difficult company to work at because Elon Musk is an unreasonable person. Not in a bad way, but in a motivating way where he doesn't take no for an answer. He wants to learn what you got wrong, why you got it wrong, how you got to do a different to achieve the goal. So yes or no, yes, we got it. No, we didn't. A lot of people aren't well-tooled to work in that environment. And there's a lot of burnout and a lot of turnover as people like to talk about for Tesla with heavy, heavy departures over here. Craig, I only got 30 seconds here. Colder months, they're coming soon. China and Tesla production, that's going to remain one of the main areas to continue to track and can the company adequately mitigate any logistics impacts and factory shutdowns. As it doesn't seem China's going to change their zero-COVID policy anytime soon. China's going to be tough for them, that's going to determine whether or not they make their numbers this year, 20,000 unit mists or 19,000 unit mists is China, right? I don't think this is what's the biggest issue for the company. It's a big issue with competition and alternative equities like Porsche and the upcoming Ford spin-off. Large, well-established properties that are executing well. You have other examples of some of the SPAC IPOs that are actually showing success. And Tesla has big problems on the horizon as far as this competitive environment. And they don't really have the technology lead that many many people claim. Everybody has access, this name, same database. Imagine that, competition for Tesla, Craig. Thank you so much, Craig Irwin, Rothka, and the Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst. I appreciate your time this morning, thank you. Thank you. And one final check on the market before you leave you as we see Twitter shares a little bit weaker here today. So we're the overall markets, not seeing a huge decline, but a bit of a pullback. And coming up in the next hour, more on the Twitter drama with Sinan Oral and Yahoo Finance is Jared Glickry, Sinan who is literally worth a book.

2746, I finance it's 11 a.m. in New York City. I'm Jared Blickery and here's what I am watching. Stocks dip as yields take higher amid uncertainty over the path of inflation. Tomorrow's jobs report is a main event and we'll talk market positioning with Black Rocks way Lee in a minute. Goldman Sachs by the way stays bullish on oil raising its crude forecast to $110 a barrel. That's at the aftermath of this OPEC plus decision. Joe Biden's his move cut move was cut was short-sighted and we'll see if the energy world's Dan Dicker agrees with us and investors wait for progress on the newly revived discussion between Twitter and Elon Musk. We look at the chance of a deal and the flow of information if we get one. But first let's take a quick look at the markets we see the Dow under a little bit of pressure down about 100 points the S&P 500 off about one quarter of a percent and the Nasdaq off just slightly and then checking in on the bond market we do see yields elevated just ever so slightly in the looks like the five ten and also thirty year tenor and with all eyes on tomorrow's jobs report let's welcome in Black Rocks global chief investment strategist way Lee and could you please give us your forecast and by the way it's great to see you here could you please give us your forecast of what you expect tomorrow because this is one half fifty percent of the feds dual mandate a lot of eyes on this report hi there good morning thanks for having me so in terms of the jobs report I think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,65,2022-10-06 18:33:16
2747," A lot of eyes on this report. Hi there, good morning, thanks for having me. So in terms of the jobs report, I think given how strong earlier momentans are, it's possible that we could see kind of headline decrease, but I would say that our focus is really solely what mainly around the participation rate, because labor shortage has really contributed to this supply-shaped environment. So if that starts to be alleviated, certainly that would have feed through to inflationary dynamics, and that would feed through to market pricing for rate hikes and also broadly risk sentiment as well. And let me ask you just generally about some of the central bank actions we've seen around the world over the last two weeks. A bit of a 180 by the bank of England. Now buying bonds, albeit for a short period of time, ostensibly speaking, also the bank of Japan buying the US dollar, or excuse me, buying its own currency, the yen trying to strengthen that versus others as well as the US dollar. What are you seeing in the global effects world? And what implications do you think this might have for equities, especially as we consider these jobs numbers that you just explained to us? I think what we're seeing really is a result of this supply driven new regime that we're in, whereby given the fact that inflationary pressure comes from supply, bottlenecks, and supply shortages, then it's a lot harder for central banks to fight that. There are tools, a primarily focused on addressing the demand side of equation. So you talked about bank of England going from announcing QT to start buying bonds. Obviously there are specific kind of fiscal development in the UK that led to the bond buying, but more broadly it just goes to show how difficult it is for a central bank decision making in this supply driven environment characterized by tougher trade-offs. And you also talked about bank of Japan and more broadly policy development and currency as well. I will make one observation so far this year, depending on where you are based, depending on which currency you are denominated, your experience of the global market returns can be vastly, vastly different. Part of that is the dollar strength, but it's more than that as well. So dollar in the near term is very much driven by rate differential as well as global risk, calm and risk of sentiment so far has been very, very strong. But given the fact that how much currencies are contributing to the experience of investors of the global markets, we think that it's actually really important when we think about our allocation to consider where our investors and clients are based in, which is why we're rolling out regional asset locations. So for example, I am sitting here in the UK and we recently rolled out Euro asset location views. So really from the perspective of the Euro denominated investors, how their asset allocation could look like versus a dollar denominated investors. And that is critical, being local is critical in the context of the elevated macro uncertainty and elevated currency volatility. Yeah, call it part for the course versus, I guess, based on this trend of de-globalization that we've seen over the last five plus years. Now, I want to talk a little bit more generally about the, we saw the US dollar strength in versus most currencies quite considerably. It's backed off of that. And the other part of the equation there is with an easing US dollar in the short term, we're seeing a bid for commodities. Now, we've been talking a lot about OPEC plus and oil, but I want to focus on silver, gold, and some of the other commodities that we've recently catch a bid. A lot of people have either been waiting for gold to catch a bid or have just counted it out entirely. What do you think of the precious metal complex right now? Well, exactly as you framed the correlation between the dollar and precious metal has been in place. And I think in that context as dollar, Wikens, you talked about how the risk on sentiment earlier in the week led to a weaker dollar. It has been somewhat supportive, or firm, of companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,66,2022-10-06 18:37:26
2748," You talked about how the risk on the sentiment earlier in the week led to a weaker dollar. It has been somewhat supportive of commodities and precious metals for that matter. But I would broadly say, though the importance of diversification cannot be overstated in the context of the world that we're entering into. So thinking about the macro environment, we're currently expecting a recession. This year in Europe, in the UK, and next year in the US. And at the same time, risks of central banks over tightening policies into restrictive territories in order to fight inflation. The risks of that have risen significantly. Recently, but also certainly versus beginning of the year. So in this kind of environment where it makes sense to be more prudent when it comes to our location, when it comes to portfolio risks taking, than having diversification in portfolio makes sense and certainly goes to play the role in that. And I think that is also part of the considerations behind recent price action. We got a time for one more, a bit brief here. But I want to talk to you about the Chinese UN and also policy makers there. We've seen the UN strengthen against the Japanese yen about 12% year to date. Yen has considered, we can consider it, and I talked about the measures by the BOJ before. Do you think the PBOC intervenes in the yuan here? And what consequences would that have for global risk assets? Well, I think more broadly when we talk about the Chinese yuan, we also have to talk about the Chinese economy. Right? So what has happened so far this year is that there has been significant headwind for Chinese economy from the perspective of the zero-covid policy, acting as a dampener to economic reopening momentum and at the same time previously the Chinese economy was supported by the tailwind of global exports. Right? Like when the rest of the world was in shutdown, the export from China and the demand for that has added to strong momentum last year. But now the rest of the world is switching back on and China is in zero-covid mode. So that export tailwind is fading away as well. And both of their act as headwind and challenges for Chinese economy this year and the Chinese currency movement so far this year are reflection of that. You talked about versus the yuan, but also versus the dollar of course, the dollar story is beyond more than just Chinese yuan. I would say one thing though, as we kind of head into next year, some expectation needs to be big deal around the restart momentum, obviously a lot contingent on how the COVID policy would evolve. But in the same way that the US economy opened up with strong momentum, your PM economy opened up with strong momentum in such an expect higher growth levels next year versus 2022. So if I say lots of moving parts here, really appreciate your insights as always, Wailie, BlackRock, Global Investment Chief Strategist. Thank you for your time. And we're keeping an eye on oil prices as well this morning following a big move by OPEC Plus to slash output by two million barrels a day beginning in November, exceeding market expectations and incurring the wrath of the Biden White House for more on this. Let's welcome in, Yahoo finances in S for a and we got a little bit of a surprise yesterday. And as we've been talking about now, OPEC Plus has already not been able to fill its quotas. So they said, this is really just a cut of about one to 1.1 million barrels per day. That's still a lot of nests. Yeah, that's, that is, it's significant. It's a significant cut and one takeaway is that OPEC Plus must be concerned about a world ride recession in order to be making such a cut. Goldman Sachs came out with a forecast and updated forecast saying that oil could reach $110 a barrel in Q4, also $115 a barrel by the end of the first quarter of 2023. And if these cuts are sustained through December of 2023, then these elevated prices would remain elevated. I mean, the only thing that could bring it down is really demand destruction at this point. Now, during the financial crisis, Jared, between 2008, 2009, oil prices, those had peaked at $145. It came all the way down to $30.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,67,2022-10-06 18:41:45
2749," down is really demand destruction at this point. Now during the financial crisis, Jared, between 2008, 2009, oil prices, those had peaked at $145. They came all the way down to $35 a barrel in five months time. Andy Lipo of Lipo Associates is saying basically that, look, they must be worried in order for them to be doing this. It also shows you that the US dollar has also been having a huge impact on these oil prices. We've also seen some rubblings or heard them that the Biden White House would also consider another release from this strategic petroleum reserve that's the SPR. We saw that take a place and be in effect earlier this year. I think those purchases or those releases have now concluded, but what about the possible effects of any new releases from the SPR? Yeah, well, certainly that would have a short term effect. Like we've seen with gasoline prices, as we've seen those gasoline prices coming lower. But one interesting point also about this OPEC plus decision is it kind of also shows you the waning influence of the US, because this is as much as it is about demand and supply as it is also political in a way as well. And the sort of relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the sort of waning influence that the US is having on the cartel as well. Yeah, and I'd add the most important influence the US has on the cartel is the fact that WTI, a most global oil is quoted in US dollars. So a huge investment, I would guess you would say, to protect right there. Thank you for that. Yeah, who finances in us for it? All right, our trending ticker of the day is Pinterest. It is surging 45% after Goldman Sachs, upgraded stock to buy from Newfrolet and raised its price target to $31 from $24. Goldman analysts, Eric Sheridan likes the improvements in user growth and engagement, as well as the potential for revenue growth and operating margin into next year in 2024. Monetization is a key area that Goldman also likes with the prospect for the social media company increasing its share of ad spending and that's as companies cut budgets and expenses and coming up. You're going to want to take a look at this. Talking cyclical stocks, the ride continues, love that plan continues for Peloton. As a pandemic era, darling announces 500 more job cuts. We're about 12% of its workforce. Will the struggling group find its feet? We take the deep dive next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,68,2022-10-06 18:47:37
2750,"locks every day enroll to obey to release new Welcome back. Peloton laying off a large number of its employees. 500 to be exact for the fourth time this year in another effort to save its struggling business. Yahoo! Finances Brad Smith here with the latest Brad what are the details? So the details around this of course as you laid out yet another round of layoffs for Peloton and this is really under the direction of the new CEO Barry McCarthy who is really looking to cut costs and make sure that in this environment where the company is trying to create more partnerships on the wholesale front see more of their cash and capital be put towards actually being able to continue production but also the right sizing of production and overall just the structure of the company that that really comes down and hits some of unfortunately the employee base. Now what we also do know is that even over the course of earlier this week they had netted some new partnerships on the wholesale front and it really kind of spells out what Barry McCarthy is looking to do is tap some of those wholesale partners look to those channels to potentially drum up even more subscribers within everything from Dick Sports all the way to your Hilton stake and then eventually being able to at the same time build on the digital subscriptions the number of people that are continuing to use these connected devices but then it comes back to if he does not see the growth necessary in this next stretch of time and he's looking out to these six month period even out as far as 18 months perhaps to say whether or not Peloton has been successful at implementing some of these changes and if it will prove to push them back to profitability as well. One at Hone and we got a brief second here on that timeline. Sure. Now he based but this is McCarthy basically gave the company six months and he did not immense words here have you ever heard of a CEO of a company give a going concern risk factor to its employees basically in this context. Not one that isn't already looking at perhaps some type of bankruptcy. It would have to be imminent. Immunin threat and what's even more noteworthy about that is whether or not they would actually be looking for a sale if they weren't able to hit some of those potential targets because he did bring up this thought of I don't know if we are a standalone company or a viable standalone company just Peloton if we're not able to hit some of these financial targets that we've set forth. He did say that this is the most optimistic that he has been but he certainly to your point did not immense words there and it starts to raise the question about who would buy a Peloton especially when you've already got other stationary bikes that are being sold at Dix that are already being sold on Amazon. So then it gets into the rest of the fitness category and the connected device category too and it's really tough to sell on whether or not it would be a company in Apple or some other major tech company that would say no what yeah we'll take on a connected fitness device company where they've already struggled to kind of move lots new homes. Yeah lots of baggage there we'll have to see what happens but peak Peloton with the stock down over 90 percent we'll see what comes of that. Thank you for that Brad Smith. And now a new game all the kids are playing as well as Wall Street veterans and they're raging about it. Spac D-spac or Fold and who better to join us with an update of this beleaguered sector is Alexander Seminova Alex you excuse me you've been covering this and IPOs have done poorly this year. Spac's much worse. What are the details? Yeah, it's just a terrible time for the SPAC market such a huge turnaround from last year and the year before what has been called the SPAC Renaissance East Child that saw this",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,69,2022-10-06 18:50:36
2751," So terrible time for the SPAC market. Such a huge turnaround from last year and the year before, what has been called the SPAC Renaissance Beast Show that saw this sharp uptick in SPAC activity. And really a big come down this year. SPAC liquidations are on the rise with these bling check companies really struggling to find targets for their deals to close so far this year. 22 special purpose acquisition companies worth about $10 billion have been liquidated. According to a weekly report by SPAC research, that's more than half of those liquidations have occurred since August. And that's not even taking into consideration the liquidations that have been announced and haven't actually happened yet. For example, last week, Tamath Paliya Patiyah said in a regulatory filing that he would liquidate two of his SPACs also after failing to find a target and return $1.6 billion to investors. Bill Ackman also liquidated his vehicle. So it's just one after the other that is falling apart. Yeah, and I read an interesting stat yesterday that 40% of these SPAC companies are issuing going concern warnings. That means they might go out of business for their investors. And that's double the IPO rate. But I want to hone in on some news today. George Soros' son, well, he's been part of the SPAC movement as well. We got some details there. You can share with us. Yeah, so Bloomberg reported yesterday that the Everton Football Club spurred takeover interest from a SPAC led by George Soros' nephew that's according to people familiar with the matter. But there's no certainty yet whether the transaction will be closed, especially in this market where some deals are announced, but they don't actually follow through because the conditions are changing so rapidly. Yep, rapidly changing conditions. We've come to see this as the new norm. Yahoo, finances, Alex, Selenova, thank you for sharing that. Coming up, Black Gold getting a tailwind, Goldman's oil team stays with a bullish call for $100, $110 for Per Barrel on Brent.

2752,".... Welcome back the bold seam in control after the third quarter kicked off with a big two-day rally but a slew of economic data ahead could alter the market optimism and I want to get a quick check of the Wi-Fi interactive where we can see energy in the forefront today followed by communication services, tech and consumer discretionary. Those are at the top what you see in green. To the downside, utilities is down almost 2% followed by real estate and health care. All of those are defensive sectors and let's get a check of the majors now and we can see a mix board. Nasdaq just barely in the green by seven basis points. It's been fluctuating all day and then the Dow is down about one third of a percent and the S&P 500 down one fifth of a percent. So without further ado we want to talk about the current market action and that is with Kali Cox. She is E-Torrell's US investment analyst and Kali. Always great to see you here. We've done a number of webinars together and we've talked about some of the statistics in the S&P 500 and I think you and I were looking at some of the same data this week and what were you looking at? What were some of the conclusions that you came to? Yeah, dear. We were looking at some of the same data. I mean the rally we've seen so far this week or at least on Monday and Tuesday has been fierce. I think we can all agree on that. But it's so fierce, I mean it's the first time the S&P has rallied 2.5 percent or more and back-to-back days since December 2008 and you and I both ran the data, right? We see these kinds of rallies either deep in their market or in the first few days after a bull market starts which is the exact opposite to Nareo's there, right? And it just goes to show just how complicated this environment is for investors, how just the motion fueled and panicky it feels and it's quite a tough position to be in because we could be staring down to different paths here. And so investors who are nervous right now, what is your advice to them? Hopefully everybody's sitting on piles of cash but that's not necessarily the case. I know that I have a significant amount deployed. Got some on the sidelines here ready to be deployed. What are you telling your clients right now? Yeah, well it's interesting you say that because you've seen the sentiment and the sour moon that the market is in, I'd expect there to be more cash on the sidelines than then we think. But at the same time, we're telling our clients to really manage your emotions here, to understand where the market environment is but also the fact that it could be very costly to mess out on the first few days of a bull market. We really like a barbell strategy here holding on to some risk but being defensive at the same time. And where do you see the market opportunities when this market finally turns around? Hopefully it already has, maybe the lows in but that's not necessarily the sure bet right now. What kind of sectors or styles are you looking at? Yeah, well this market really is bottoming. We would expect to see more of an uptick and risk here, more of a surge in growth your assets here. We really like quality risks though at the moment. I mean, there are a lot of different flavors of growth stocks. We all know that with tech, you could look at the more speculative concept stocks or you could look at big tech. Everything big tech is a good example of quality risk with strong financials. And at the same time, we really like sickle-cooked here but we're feeling a little more cautious at the moment only because we don't know what the future holds for us here. And if we see growth deteriorate much more, we could see that reflected in sickle stocks. Ekele, I was writing our newsletter this morning. The morning brief, actually I wrote it yesterday afternoon for publication this morning but it was about those very same market statistics that you were talking about. After I ran the data and I saw kind of a mixed bag there, I kind of went off on a rant. And you know, you and I love to parse the data and look for things. Sometimes we don't always find an edge. Maybe you did. Maybe I didn't. But I think my message for investors is sometimes you just got to turn off the news. Not Yahoo Finance, of course, while you're watching this broadcast.

2753," But I think my message for investors is sometimes you just got to turn off the news, not Yahoo Finance, of course, while you're watching this broadcast, but you got to filter out the noise, just wondering what you're thinking about this as you also talk to some of your clients. Oh, it's so hard because it's so noisy these days and there are so many, you know, things you can look at to find that signal. And I mean, here, I do know I like person through data, you just said that, but I always try to remind people that, you know, when we see these big enough, you Welcome to Yahoo Finance on this Thursday afternoon. I'm Sean Smith along with Dave Briggs. Let's get you up to speed on the market action as we head into the final hour of trading. Taking a look at the major averages, all three, the major averages in the red right now, starting with the Dow, the Dow off just around 375 points back below 30,000 in the Nasak off just around 6, 10th of a percent. S&P also moving to the downside off about 1% today, Russell 2000, the small cap index here, moving to the downside once again off just around 6, 10th of a percent. You look at the bond market, the yield of trending higher once again as we're seeing pressure in equities a 10 year yield up to six basis points to 382, the 30 year up to 3, 7, and 9. You look at the US dollar index that also trending to the upside now back above 112. So you look at some of the sector action this afternoon, a bit of a mixed picture. I guess you can say with energy, the only sector holding onto gains up just around 1.6 percent. But for the rest of the market, we really are seeing some pretty broad base selling real estate and utilities, the worst performer so far, of the day real estate and utilities both off just around 3 percent, Dave. Thank you, Sean. Let's get you up to speed now on the oil market still ingesting that historic cut from OPEC Plus that's bringing it as for a for the latest price action. Want to get your thoughts on some White House comments first, but what do we see in today? Yeah, that's right. So today we did see oil settle higher for the fourth straight day. And of course, after about 2 million barrel per day cut that was announced by OPEC Plus this week, Goldman Sachs now saying that it could see oil going up to as high as $110 per barrel in the first quarter, $1.15 by the first quarter of 2023. And if the cuts were to last through December,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,72,2022-10-06 19:03:30
2754," for barrel in the first quarter, one-fifteen by the first quarter of 2023. And if the cuts were to last through December of 2023, then you could see these elevated prices higher. And some analysts are saying this really goes to show you the gravity, sort of speak of how OPEC sees the possibility of a worldwide recession by cutting by this much. Now, some countries don't meet their quota already, so it's not necessarily two million barrels per day. But nonetheless, the only thing that would really drive prices lower were to be a serious recession. And we did see from 2008 to 2009, when you saw oil prices go from $145 per barrel all the way down to $35 in five months time. And I mentioned some comments from the White House. You know, as Amos Hockstein says, he doesn't think increased prices will be a result to this. He also said he thinks it's well below two million in actuality, closer to 900,000. And then he qualified that by saying, if there are any net cuts at all, he says some countries will cut, others will increase. What do you make of those comments? Yeah, that's right. So he's basically reiterating that some countries, as you mentioned, are not meeting their quotas. So you can't really say that it's two million barrels per day. Also talking about the SPR and that there is some space to release more of the reserve. Look, nonetheless, you did have officials from the White House basically saying that they're disappointed by this. They're disappointed by OPEX plus decision. And some analysts would say that it's as much of the decision about supply and demand as it is also a political decision because certainly this is a snub towards the US. Yeah, that visit and that fist bump with MBS certainly looks unproductive. In Esfere, thanks so much, appreciate that. Let's talk more about the markets with Jack Adlin, Crescent Capital, CIO and Founding Partner. Jack, always good to see you, sir. Big picture, the cuts from OPEX plus what do you mean for the markets? Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably suggest that the headline is a little more striking than actuality. I think you alluded to the fact that there are number of members that aren't meeting their current quota. So the net effect of this two million barrel drop is closer to five to 700,000 barrels a day. Still, we don't like to see production cuts, but it isn't as stark as what the headlines would suggest. Jack, looking at the broader market action today, all three of the major averages under pressure once again, we started the week on a very upbeat and I know with the Dow rallying 1,500 points in just two days, but we have now seen two days of selling. Where do you think we go from here? Is there more downside risk ahead? There can be, you know, really it's all about the 10-year treasury and it's all about the dollar. I think that if you looked at just the year-to-date performance of the S&P 500, it's virtually entirely explained by the move from 1 1,5% 10 year up to 375, 380 10 year. So I think that explains virtually to the decimal point, the move in the S&P 500. Now, of course, we're watching the dollar because it really signals how investors view the Fed. Once investors believe that there's light at the end of the tightening tunnel, we'll start to see the dollar peak and then start to roll over. In that case, I think then it's probably an all clear signal for equity investing and probably foreign stocks, non-dollar, denominated stocks will likely lead the way higher. But until that time, unfortunately, the 10-year treasury is really held hostage by the Fed. If they do believe that the market's rally too much and that the wealth effect could undermine their ability to fight inflation, guess what, they start selling treasury notes and push that rate higher. So I'm not necessarily banking on the rate yet. I think it's all about the Fed at the moment. And the Fed all about at the moment, tomorrow's jobs report, what do you think they need to see to change the narrative? Sure, unfortunately.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,73,2022-10-06 19:08:00
2755," at the moment. And the Fed all about at the moment tomorrow's jobs report, what do you think they need to see to change the narrative? Sure, unfortunately, the jobs report isn't really the big data point anymore. It's taken a backseat to the inflation data, but I'd like to see something that is consistent with what we saw with the jobs, the Jolts report, showing a million fewer job openings, and then the higher claims earlier today. If we see a jobs report that's consistent with that, perhaps lesser hiring, lower hourly hours worked, and the hourly wages slipping. I think that's a good sign, but still nothing's going to underscore the inflation until the inflation data comes out next week. Check another big thing for the markets next week is going to be earning season big banks starting to report their results. We certainly have seen estimates revised lower. What are you expecting from third quarter earnings season? I guess what do you think it's going to tell us just about the strength or the weakness of the equity markets here in the fourth quarter? Yeah, so I think this is certainly not a great environment for banks. We're heading into a downturn. The curve is inverted, so there's really no opportunity necessarily for net interest margin. We also have banks tightening their lending standards as they perhaps start to see some weakness among their borrowers. Then we've got a lot of the trading and buy out activity substantially lower. There aren't too many levers for the banks right now. The good news is I suppose bigger picture. Their capital positions are a lot stronger. We generally don't make the same big mistake twice in a row. Although we are watching some of the European banks to see how they're going to hold up in their stark economy moving into the next couple quarters. Yeah, looks ugly ahead and given all that, new favorite high quality companies who have grown their dividends over time. Do you have some examples of such? Sure. Again, there's nothing really too crazy, but Chevron, a great high quality company with a 3.8% or so of dividend yield. This is a company that's been growing. It's dividend at 5.3% annually for the last five years. So that's pretty strong. We've got general dynamics. Also, pretty nice sweet spot of the market. 2.99% dividend yield growing. It's dividend at 8.9% over the last five years. And then lastly, archer Daniels Midland, ADM, 1.9% dividend yield growing. It's dividend at about 4.5% annually. So pretty strong players in sectors of the market that are somewhat insulated from the vagaries of the economy right now. And we'll call it a no news as good news environment for these stocks. Check another big story. Another big concern here for investors. Really, for multi-national companies has been the strong dollar. We have the US dollar index back above 1.12 today. I guess how big of a risk do you see this being as we head into the final quarter of the year? Yeah, I've never seen. I don't think the market has seen the dollar strength and as strong as much in such a short period of time. And so when you start looking at global economies and global markets, that creates some dislocations that we don't know is going to happen. So part of the concern we have certainly is in emerging market debt perhaps, particularly that segment of the emerging market debt market that's denominated in US dollars. And other other economies, other central banks. So I think we see issues there. The good news is, though, fundamentally, the dollar is very expensive relative to many of our trading partners currencies. And so once we see, again, a peak in a fed tightening in that peak in the dollar, my guess is the next opportunity for risk taking. It's going to be in non-dollar markets like the Japanese yen or the EWJ for example could be an interesting play. All right, Jack Abel. And always great to talk to you. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us today. Thank you. Well, we are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live.

2756," I'm always great to talk to you. Thanks so much for taking the time to join us today. Thank you. Well, we are just getting started here on Yahoo Finance Live. Coming up, Peloton CEO says its latest round of job cuts is a quote, necessary step to save Peloton. And an analyst weighs in to tell us if he agrees. The deal is not done yet. Elon Musk and Twitter are still hammering out their $44 billion buyout agreement. Find out what the holdup is. And Adidas reviewing its deal with Kanye West, fellow streetwear investor, Shark Tankstar, Damon John, weighs in. Don't go anywhere. Peloton shares moving to the upside today. Up just around three and a half percent after announcing that it is cutting 500 more jobs. It's fourth layoff announcement of the year CEO, Barry McCarthy, telling the Wall Street Journal, quote, we need to grow to get the business to sustainable level here to talk about what that level could potentially look like. And the path forward for Peloton, we want to bring in Simeon Segal, BMO capital markets, managing a director and a senior analyst. Simeon, it's great to see you. So McCarthy, out saying that these cuts are necessary to put the company in a better position. I guess how do you see Peloton positioned right now? And is it in a position to return to growth? Hey, great to see you. Great to be here. I think that we need to incorporate or internalize the fact that Peloton has a great brand. It has a great community. But that doesn't necessarily mean it has room for growth at this point. And so I think what we're seeing now as a turnaround is just that much more difficult. We're watching incremental costs cuts, unfortunately, which are impacting people's lives. But it's also this decision to recognize that to get to profitability, the company needs to recalibrate. And so I think if we can focus on profitability as opposed to growth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,75,2022-10-06 19:16:43
2757," back in people's lives. But it's also this decision to recognize that to get to profitability, the company needs to recalibrate. And so I think if we can focus on profitability as opposed to growth, I think there's a story. I think every time the focus is on trying to get a new member, there's going to be another drag. And now their fourth round of layoffs leaves them about half the number of employees they had at their peak. The interesting report also says McCarthy gives him six months to turn this around. If you're a betting man, what kind of chances do you give Peloton to turn it around in six months? Yeah, so fortunately, I'm not allowed to be a betting man right here. So that's the fact. So the fact that they say right now, it's an interesting point. So there were a few different articles out there today. One of them mentioned six months. One of them didn't. My understanding of the Peloton email that was sent out did not mention the six months. So but it's there. And that means we have to ask the question, what does that mean? And so I think that there's been so much of a conversation surrounding the fact that Peloton went from here to here really quickly. Now it's somewhere in the middle or somewhere down here. All the question there is what's the value? Is there an acquirer? And so I think the six month conversation started raising the question again of is there a point in which Peloton management says, you know, let's run a sale process? And that's I think the relevance in the interesting part of that six months nuance comment that you bring up. But we have to remember, even if the company decides they want to sell, it doesn't necessarily mean you have somebody who wants to buy. And I think what we have to still ask the same question, we've been asking it since February of 22 when people first started talking about are there acquirers? At the end of the day for a company that's watching it's the man falter and it's churned grow, does Peloton now that the company is cheaper, look more attractive? Or for these big tech companies that have been named as potential acquirers, wouldn't they have rather bought this company when it was on its way up when it was grabbing that mind share? So I think that it's very interesting. And the comments today are very interesting, raising, re-raising the question of, should emanate you on the table? But I think we still have to figure out just because they, even if they decide they want to put it up for sale, which they have certainly said they're not, do they find someone who wants to pick the stock up or the company up, given where it has come down to? Well, Sidney, what do you think? Because you obviously follow the company so closely, you've been an analyst tracking Peloton's every move now for quite some time. Do you think a sale is likely to be on the table at some point? Yeah, I think that it is hard. And the lesson I can obviously be wrong when it comes to this. But I think that at the end of the day, Peloton, as an entity, we've published a report noting that the downside, Leacy, it can be $5. And the thought process there is, if you have three million subscribers that become $2 million, because the churn goes up and because the people that bought during COVID aren't necessarily your best customers. So if you were, and again, not saying they will, but if you were to lose a third of your base at the current price, you can still just $5.5 stock. We have to internalize that still, right? We're still in the billions of market cap as we think about what that means. So for a company to come in and buy, you have to figure out what they're getting. And right now, what you're getting is an ongoing bleed of your members as opposed to a growth of your members. So I think what the company needs to do is convince themselves in the outside world whether they sell themselves or not, that they can find the bottom, that they can stabilize, that they can say we've got very strong, loyal brand, loyal brand people that are willing to pay are recurring $44 a month, and maybe even more. But the question is, what is that number? We don't know that yet. And I think every dollar that's spent trying to get someone new, rather than committed to focus on maintaining the people that are already involved, I think it's a dollar that's probably not that well spent. And I think that's what we're seeing. And so I think is there a value with where Peloton is worth, yeah, I'm not in the camp that Peloton is zero far from it. I think Peloton offers something very compelling and makes people very happy. But we need to figure out what that level is. And that's, I think, the question that's going on right now. And the companies you often read about, of course, the usual suspects, Apple, Amazon with more cash than most countries. And then of course Netflix, maybe on the undercard, does any of those make sense? So again, way out of my pay grade, but I think it's there to ask the question of, is Peloton in trouble more attractive to one of those companies, at a billion, two billion, three billion, four billion, versus Peloton doing really well at 10 to 15 billion? Because the companies you just mentioned are very large companies with very large market caps. And so what they rather is that incremental $10 billion, I know this sounds absurd, but it's the incremental $10 billion to catch a,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,76,2022-10-06 19:21:23
2758," Companies you just mentioned are very large companies with very large market caps. And so what they rather is that incremental $10 billion, I know this sounds absurd, is the incremental $10 billion to catch a falling knife more attractive than if they would have wanted it on the way up. I just, I think right now we're talking about this as a distressed asset. And the companies you just mentioned are looking for growth vectors. They're not looking to try and get something on the cheap unless they believe it's stable. So that's what I think the company has. I think for their standalone or for an acquisition they need to show they can be stable. Because until then you have to ask that question of what does NAPO really get at this point that they couldn't have gotten better off last year when they thought the trajectory was just going up into the right. So, I mean, what do you think it's going to take for Peloton's turnaround effort to really start to resonate with investors? Yeah, I think that's an excellent question. And I think well, he is all about perspective and where we start from. I think if we internalize what the company did, they went from zero to several billion dollars. That is a tremendous achievement in a very short amount of time. The problem is in between them, they went to 50 billion dollars. And so at the end of the day, it's hard to argue that it's not resonating with investors. It's just not resonating with the investors the way it did over the last few years. And that's been effectively the reason we've had the celebrating. But I do think right now it is still a very, it's valued at a very large business. A lot of the companies that went public later than they did. A lot of companies that are younger than they did have watched up and down as well. So I think for them to get people back on board, people need to be able to create the bottom. I know I've said a few times and it's this idea that once you can create the stable, once you can create the trough, you can start building back up and figure out where you're going to go. But people need to figure out his Peloton growth story or they just a very nice business. And then there's nothing wrong with being a very nice business. But that gets me to that $5 of earnings, which is so much lower than where we are right now. Or sorry, $5 share price. So that's I think this element of figuring out the identity. Every time we hear about another ongoing cut, it makes people think, well, maybe I'm not at the bottom yet. Maybe I don't know where we are. And I think that's the next shoe to drop. We have to find out what the churn starts looking like over the next year. So I think there's still a lot of questions. Indeed, there are. Simeon Siegel answered a lot of them for us from BMO. Appreciate that good stuff. All right. The new developments now in the Twitter Elon Musk saga. The Wall Street Journal reporting that the two sides could reach a deal by Monday. And right now the talks are focused on financing and litigation. That timeline would also have heard a deposition from Elon Musk, which had been delayed until then. The goal it appears from both sides is to stay the Delaware Chance Record trial, which is slated to start on October 17th. And a court filing Elon Musk as the deal could close on or around October 28th. Stay tuned.

2759," People is This time for triple play, three socks that were watching in the final 30 minutes of trading Pinterest, Tesla and Uber. Let's kick it off with my pick and that is Pinterest. Goldman, upgrading the stock to a buy, lifting its price target to $31 a share and playing 25% upside for the stock. And what they call a more positive risk-reward skew. Now, analyst Eric Shardin is optimistic about Pinterest's efforts to grow its user base and also increase monetization, writing in a note to clients that, quote, despite some uncertainty in the near term, we see Pinterest as positively levered to a number of long-term secular growth themes. Now, those seems, including engagement and ad that spend shifting online, also social commerce and the creator economy. Pinterest shares more than 30% in the past three months, but year to date still well in the red. Off just over 40%. So, Jared, we have Goldman getting a little bit more bullish on Pinterest. You can't help but wonder how much of a valuation call this is with the stock off so significantly since it started the year. I think so, Shana. Pictures worth a thousand words. Let's go to the Wi-Fi Interactive where I have a max chart going back to their IPO date. Late 2019, actually, this is just the last three years. If we put a max there, we go. We can see all the way back to 2019. Anyway, we got this Brian Sasi bulging bicep pattern as he likes to call it, but as you can see, no lie, we do a lot of this on the morning show. You should check it out sometimes. There is a rounded bottom here that the stock has been making all year long. 28 looks like a maker break. Level for me, it's right there. A lot of times you might see a little bit of a dip. That would be a massive saucer and handle formation that I'm tracking right there. But I do want to move on because I am looking at the EV space and we have Mizzou making, and actually cutting its price target on Tesla and Neo, though it did keep the firms by ratings on both. Once after the two automakers posted their latest production and delivery data, analysts are still saying strong demand is China moves to electrify and he characterized a quarter and it September as being quote, mostly in line as supply and logistics remain a challenge. Now Mizzou lowered its Tesla target to $370 from $391 in change, noting that effects headwinds. Read the Soring Dollar could weigh on quarterly revenue estimated to be $22.5 billion. From now see, Neo stock, by the way, trading to $40 instead of 42. Let me pull up the Wi-Fi Interactive here one more time where I have our heat map. I'm going to check on Neo first. Let's pull that up. This is a year-to-date chart. You can see mostly range bound since about March of this year, although it did have that big decline earlier. You pull up a max chart going to its IPO date on the IPO date at the New York Stock Exchange in 2018. This has been a slow, steady downtrend right here, not really breaking that trend line, so have a little bit more work to do on a breakout basis. Then take a look at Tesla here. I'm going to narrow this to the last five years. I just want to show the massive consolidations that we oftentimes have in this stock. We are in the midst of another one, have you had to break out of this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,78,2022-10-06 19:29:50

We are in the midst of another one to have you have to break out of this play either Dave. Jared, you did not explain what the dip bicep is. Is that the blickery bicep? Oh, wow. Is that a fire? Is that a subtle dig here at my chart? Pattern naming authority, or is that a dig on my bicep? I don't know, Dave. What was it bulging bicep pattern? That's what Saazi calls it. A lot of his stocks that have roundtripped their gains throughout the pandemic. That is a big thing. We need to start incorporating that into the show daily. So I'm out bulging bicep pattern. You guys trade market. I will NFT it. We're gonna be rich. There we go. That's all we need tonight. I will stay in the automobile space. My place, Uber, no shortage on the right-hailing giant this week. First, nearly two years after selling its autonomous vehicle research, you that they are back in that space. Uber is sounding a 10-year multi-market deal, a joint venture between Hyundai and Appteve for autonomous cars on both. It's right-hailing and Uber Eats delivery app. That's the key there. Trips are expected to start later this year. We're not exactly sure where, but based on regulations in California, you might expect Florida and Texas to be the first two markets. Also on Wednesday, Uber's former head of security was found guilty by a federal jury in San Francisco of attempting to cover up a data breach that actually saw tens of millions of both customer and driver records stolen. How does it all come out? The wash Uber shares up by more than 2% on the day, but as you know, it has been a struggle those far this year, still down more than 30% year to date, John. Yeah, Dave, looks like investors are a little bit encouraged about the autonomous news. It's interesting what we've seen come from a lift in Uber in this space because both have changed plans as they've been under pressure to more so focus on profitability rather than taking some of these costly chances. So this is an interesting play because it gives Uber some exposure in this space, but it doesn't have to pour all that money into its own research and development to get that exposure. So we'll see whether or not this partnership does in fact pay off. All right, coming up next. At a time when the stock market remains extremely volatile, our next guest explains why you should be investing in the space economy.

2761," massively effective razorure laser magazine. After not some around the world are en route to the International Space Station following a Wednesday launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The crew five mission is the sixth flight for the joint endeavor between Elon Musk's SpaceX and NASA, the mission commander by the way in this flight. Nicole Mann, she is the first ever Native American to travel to space. But what about the space investment space? Andrew Chanan is the Pro Cure AM founder and CEO here as part of our ETF report brought to you by Invesco QQQ. Good to see you, Andrew. We do want to talk about the ETF space, but what significant progress has SpaceX made? So what we're seeing is roughly a launch every week, which is something that is quite unheard of and the pace at which they're sending these satellites up is something that is both an opportunity as well as a concern that needs to be managed as far as space debris goes in the future. But what they're doing is really pushing the space industry forward significantly and it's creating many opportunities for numerous companies throughout the industry. Andrew, speaking of the many opportunities for companies within the industry, what is this through those two investor excitement when you're trying to get investors excited about investing in space is something like this type of space. You know, I think we saw two launches yesterday and expecting a third today. You know, one of it is extremely interesting because Elon Musk is essentially sending a Russian cosmonaut to the ISS. The first time that this has happened on from US soil in decades. So with all of the tensions that we see geopolitically seeing that space is still able to drive forward despite ongoing hostilities. This is something that shows how cooperative the industry is. But when they're sending up these satellites, you have to think about satellite manufacturers and operators. You know, parts, manufacturers for what goes into these. At the same time because they're sending up so many satellites, it's drying up the supply of launches from what space X can provide, well creating opportunities for other launch companies, many of which happened to be in the UFO ETF that are now going to see other clients potentially stepping forward for launch needs, which is something where this rising tide seems to be lifting a lot of ships here. Indeed it is. Nice analogy there. You have three reasons to invest in the space economy. What are the Andrew? You know, it's constantly changing, but one thing that we notice again with the with the Russian Ukrainian conflict going on right now is how important space is from a military standpoint. And from the early days of the invasion, satellites were actually providing us with the imagery showing the Russian troop buildup on the border. And as we've seen the different issues with one website satellites being held hostage and rocket parts not being sent from Russia due to sanctions, there creates all this need for non-Russian companies and allied countries to create these types of solutions that are needed for the space industry. And because space is so key for militaries, we're seeing a tremendous amount of spending coming from militaries and governments around the world. So the percentage of what is being spent from space coming from governments is slowly starting to increase, which is certainly encouraging. But there's also technological changes like reusable rockets that are significantly lowering the cost of entry to space. So we're at a technological turning point, which is extremely exciting. But also so many other technologies that we use utilize space. So transformative technology. And so, we're seeing a lot of things that we're seeing in the space. And so, we're seeing a lot of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,80,2022-10-06 19:38:39
2762," space. So we're at a technological turning point, which is extremely exciting. But also so many other technologies that we use utilize space. So transformative technologies like 5G, the internet of things, it connected devices, even cryptocurrency and cloud computing are starting to rely on space. So if you're looking at any of these industries and you're looking for companies that are literally operating as the digital data, told keepers for this digital data superhighway, space companies become extremely critical for that. Andrew speaking about all the money that's being spent within this industry, what do you think is the growth trajectory for this sector here, looking out over the next five to 10 years? So we're not allowed to make projections, but we can look at various research houses that do put out numbers and Morgan Stanley believes that we're looking at potentially a $1.7 trillion space economy by 2040. Think of America, Merrill Lynch has come out saying north of $2 trillion by 2045. So there are varying estimates, but one of the large reasons that people believe that this industry will continue to grow, it comes from the communication side. So broadband internet connectivity, Elon Musk is sending up basically double the amount of satellites that were in orbit as of two years ago, just in the last year or so. So we're seeing new industries emerge, other industries really starting to heat up, and this is something that hopefully could be a benefit for the broader industry as whole. All right, Andrew Chan, and always great to have you. Thanks so much. Thanks for having me. Dave? All right, some breaking news now, Shana, and some big for the cannabis space. President Biden announcing moments ago, the administration will pardon all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. This folks is a major step toward decriminalization, most believe. Cannabis stocks are jumping at the news. You can see Aurora, Canopy, Curly, Green Thumb, Truleaf, all flying on this news, in particular, Truleaf up 33. Green Thumb 26, Curly, the leader in the space, climbing towards 40% up on this news because of presumed optimism of federal legalization by the instructing health and human services secretary, Xavier Bissera, to initiate a review on how marijuana is scheduled under federal law. Currently, marijuana is a schedule one drug designated for the most dangerous substances on the same level as heroin and LSD, pot stocks, flying on this news. Interesting to digest the other next couple of days and see if there really is optimism towards federal legalization. We've still heard zero Republicans to date in the Senate support any legislation, even safe banking, which has passed the House six times and cannot get out of the Senate. And that does not have to do with federal legalization, just rather the banking space. Shana, it's interesting to see this kind of optimism. It is. It's very interesting to see this kind of optimism, especially when you take a look at how the stocks are reacting to this. And I think they have been waiting for this sort of ruling here or some sort of statement from the White House, from the administration in terms of their plans here, how they are going to deal with some of those offenses. So the fact that we are getting this news, we're seeing the reaction and some of the largest players in this space, David, the roar of just around five and a half percent, Curlyf rallying. Look at that. Up 29% now, 30% green thumb. Truly, if you're all have a massive move to the upsides of the catalyst, I think that this sector has been waiting for for quite some time. Yeah, I'll just be honest here. I mean, this business has been waiting for anything optimistic. I don't know that this changes the equation at all, but I understand that they've been waiting for any sort of good news in this industry. Coming up next, we're going to, we're going to check in with on real estate mortgage rates headed in the right direction. A real surprise turnaround. I'll be at slight good news. We'll also take a look at the rental market ahead.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,81,2022-10-06 19:42:30
2763," MUSIC A sliver of good news for potential home buyers today is mortgage rates falling slightly after rising for six straight weeks. The 30 year fixed falling to 6.66%. As you can see on the screen from 6.7 a week ago, that's according to Freddie Mac and their chief economist attributing the drop to quote ongoing economic uncertainty. Rate still over more than double what they were one year ago. In practical terms, that means an average monthly mortgage more than $1,000 per month more than this time last year on a $500,000 loan. Meanwhile, the median monthly mortgage rate is up $800 just since January. A little bit more context, current rates will actually cost perspective buyers around $100,000 in actual home buying power compared to a year ago. Overall though, the story remains unchanged. New listings fell for the 13th straight week. They are down 17% from a year ago. Homes are sitting on the market for longer by an average of six extra days compared to a year ago. The projection still suggests we will see 7% mortgage rates in the 30 year fixed before we'll see 6.5. Obviously, mortgage rates do not rise and fall directly with Fed action more tied to the 10 year, but needless to say, if the Fed goes for another 75 point hike, which they are expected to, we will see rates continue to climb, Shawna. All right, Dave. Let's stick with housing here and take a look at what's happening in the rental market. As inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty are hitting that market pretty hard and your report from real payments, you found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first a three-key drop that we've seen in 30 years. We want to bring in Jay Perth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,82,2022-10-06 19:47:06
2764," Hitting that market pretty hard and your report from real page you found that apartment demand plunged in the third quarter. It's first a three-q drop that we've seen in 30 years. We want to bring in Jay Parsons, head of the economics industry principles at real page. Jay, it's great to see you. So very unusual for us to see a drop here in the third quarter, which is typically very strong three-month time frame for the rental market. What do you think is behind this massive drop that we saw? Yeah, so I think the first thing I was looking for is signs of affordability concerns, given the number of, given the rate, the rent increases that occurred over the last couple of years. But that's just not showing up. Wages are still up. Rent collection is still very high. In fact, they actually up year over year. And we're not seeing any kind of move down into cheaper units and cheaper areas. And so really what appears to be happening is a freeze in household formation because there's very little leasing traffic right now. And obviously we know people aren't buying houses right now. So it tells me that people are kind of in a weight and sea mode. And they've really pushed the pause button on their housing search for the time being. The pause button. Is that how you describe the entire housing sector at the moment? And is that because of mortgage rates? It seemed like buyers and sellers have back to your word paused. Yeah, no, I think, you know, obviously for renters, it's not necessarily mortgage rates directly, but it's those same kind of underlying factors that are driving up mortgage rates. And that's really inflation, you know? You know, we've been talking a lot about home prices and rents, but you know, one thing everyone feels every day is groceries. I mean, they're up 13% year over year. And so I think with overall inflation, we're seeing consumer confidence is way down. And you think about it, you know, when you don't feel certain about the economy and your place in it, your financial situation, human nature is to weight it out, weight and sea. And so, you know, thankfully, as you know, the job market remains strong for the time being on employment slow. And so that tells me that there's a lot of pent up demand being built up right now. So if the job market remains strong, I do think demand will come back, but it's certainly not happening right now. Jay, how long until you think that demand does return to the rental market? Yeah, good question. So these next few months, you know, winners slow period for housing of all types. You know, you don't see a lot of people moving around in the winter months. And so we really won't know much until early spring. So I think the time we get to out March, we should see that demand come back. Now, of course, if the job market turns, it could be a very different story, but at this point, I would expect to see a lot of that, particularly for rentals. I think we'll see rental demand come back first around that timeframe. What's the inventory story in the rental market? So we saw a huge drop off in vacancies in 2021, record apartment demand, record single felony rental demand. We peaked on occupancy rates in March. It has gotten a little better for renters out there. There's a little more availability. It's still low. You know, while there was weak apartment demand in Q3, it's still a very tight market. We have very low vacancy right now. We have high retention rates, but we, it's gotten a little bit better. And I think the good news for renters as well is we're gonna see a lot of new inventory next year. We're seeing 40 year highs in apartment construction. We're seeing a large number of single family rental communities, build-strength communities are being built. We've even heard of home, home sellers. We're now choosing to wrap their homes with a way out the mortgage market. And so there's definitely more inventory and I think we'll see more next year as well. Jay, what does this do to prices? I guess that there's more inventory and more options on the table. Are we gonna go and you see a pretty big drop then in rentals? I don't think we're gonna see an issue drop in rents from most parts of the country. I think we could see some seasonal cuts here in the winter months, but nothing dramatic and drastic. But I think we can see it more importantly, though, I think we're gonna see a big moderation in rent growth next year. And to be honest, we've already seen that. I mean, the certainly the CPI does not reflect this. And most of the big rent hikes occurred in 2021. And in 2022, we've really seen more moderate rent increases. And I think we're gonna see a kind of more of them return to normal in terms of rent growth next year. All right, Jay Parsons, great to get your take. Thanks so much for joining us.

Dan Halley is here with the breakdown of the new products. Dan, you were able to get your hands on these new products at the event earlier today. What do you think? The big news is the Pixel Watch. This is Google's first party smartwatch. They have made the Wear OS or Android Wear operating system before. Those have been used by the likes of Fossil, Michael Cours, Samsung to build smartwatches. None of them really looked all that fancy though. We're talking about the Michael Cours stuff. It's their own style of smartwatch. It looks incredibly elegant when you see it in person. It's a circular design. It's got these large bezels on it, but you can't really see it that much. So it just feels like the text is floating there in space. It's a 41 millimeter watch face itself. So just to give you a sense of what that means. The standard Apple Watch is 41 millimeters and then there's 45 millimeters for the larger size. This is going to fit on anybody's wrist that might be a little bit smaller. My wife, for instance, has a small wrist and that looks totally great on her. I tried it on and it looks great on me too. But everything does. I think that this is going to be something that is going to help get Android smartwatches up to speed with what Apple's been doing. Because Apple has just been straight crushing it for years. So this is potentially a way for them to get in. That's interesting because I didn't know how I would feel. But full disclosure, I'm not an Android user. So I'm not necessarily having ventured in to their products. What do you think of the phone now? The phone is really interesting. So it's basically pure Google. It's their design, their take on the software. What they think the software should be. The big stand out here is a camera. The one with the third little dot there, that's the pro. That has an ultra wide angle. An angle, a standard camera. Then it can do two times optical zoom, five times optical zoom equivalent, five times actual optical zoom, and then ten times optical zoom equivalent using different types of cropping. So it looks great. I mean, you're going to be able to see things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to zoom into with other phones.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,84,2022-10-06 19:55:12

Yahoo, finances, Ali Garfinkle here with what's next for Google and their cyber strategy. Hi there, Ali, what are you hearing? Hi Dave, great to see you. So Google Cloud Chief Information Security Officer Phil Venables sounded off this morning this afternoon, actually. And the message I was getting was really clear. Google cybersecurity ambitions are massive. This deal, as big as it is, also massively increased their threat intelligence capabilities. So they want to get this right. And I would say there are two important things for a member here. First, this is happening in a moment when cybersecurity risk is higher than ever. That's what experts have been telling me. And it makes sense that in this environment, we're seeing Google really shore up its cybersecurity position. But also the other thing too, and the second thing, the thing I'm watching is that this is their biggest deal in 10 years. It's even bigger than actually Fitbit, which actually made those watches possible in part. And I'm looking for Google to spotlight this going forward. We could see that as soon as next week, when the Mandient Deal is reportedly set to be a big part of Google Cloud's major event. So that's what I'm looking for here. All right, good stuff, Ali.

2767," All right, just a couple of minutes to the closing bell. Let's bring in Jared Blyckery with a chance to check out these markets as they are little red on the board. Hey, Jared. Little red on the board, but we're going to redeem ourselves here with an interesting look at the cannabis sector. But first, we do have markets under pressure down over 1% Sozi S&P 500, Nasdaq down 3 quarters of a percent in the Russell 2000, a little bit less than that. Let's skip straight to the action. This is the cannabis heat map that we have working here. We can see a number of issues up over 30% a lot of these Canadian issues, but also Tilray, the American ADRs traded almost 30% right now. CGC canopy up 20%. This is after Biden proposes to decriminalize, not decriminalize. Basically, it's a get out of jail free card for anybody who's been arrested for possession. Hope that goes through in the States. Take it up as well. Besides that, we are seeing a lackluster day in the stock action. Energy in the forefront, we see crude oil topping $88 per barrel to the downside. Utilities, real estate extending their losses, both of those off more than 3%. Pretty defensive sectors, so not really getting too worried about that. But we will take a look at the travel sector as we head into the frozen bell. And here we go. Another day of declines as we wrap up the training day, all three of the major averages ending in the red, the Dow off 300 and 47 points as we shake out the final trades of the day, S&P off just around 1% NASDAQ off about 7% of a percent. The sector action, energy, the only sector closing the day in positive territory, the worst performers on the flip side, real estate and utilities, both of those sectors off just over 3%. All right, let's make sense of the action that we saw today. And for that, we want to bring in Matt Stucky, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, Senior Portfolio and Strategist. And we have Jeremy Schwartz, Wisdom Tree, Global Chief Investment Officer, great to see both of you. Matt, let me start with you just in terms of the equity moves that we're seeing today. Once again, another day of declines coming off a very strong start to the week. What do you think of the action that we've seen over the past four days? Well, good afternoon. Thanks for having me on the show. I think this is just really a continuation of what we've been dealing with all year in terms of an elevated volatility profile for the market. The market is hanging on to every kind of whiff of inflation reports out there. Good reports are being met with relief rallies in the market while hot reports on inflation are just furthering the pain and increasing volatility even further. And we have a job support this tomorrow morning, which we'll wait and see how it looks. But it's just going to be another data point that markets are going to probably trade off of significantly as we look to see how the employment market is functioning here. Jeremy, do we learn more from the strong start to the week in the quarter or the last two days in the pullback? You know, we've all been bond traders as Matt was talking about where it's all pivoting on rates and the Fed and sort of you had rates fall. It started with the Bank of England stepping in to support the markets and the bond markets. Now, it was already a temporary measure. So the question is do they think things can go beyond that? I do think sentiment was very washed out. So there was an element of just sentiment being so negative that there was some measure saying sentiment was from a zero to 100 goes out as zero. And so can you go up from there? So I do think there was some relief rally from that relief from bond pressure coming off. We do think the Fed should pivot in their November meeting. We think they should go more like 50 instead of 75. But we'll see, you know, as the next month comes, is true. That would be another further catalyst for the beginning part of this week in the last few days. It's true.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,86,2022-10-06 20:04:23
2768," or catalyst for the beginning part of this week than last few days. But it's certainly all trading off of what's happening in the bond market is the key driver here. And Jeremy, how are you, I guess how are you managing some of the risk there in the bond market? Because we certainly have seen a ton of action, 10-year yield up once again today, up another six basis points to 381. How are you adjusting your portfolio as a result? Yeah, we manage model portfolios for and help give some guidance to clients on how do we think about that. We've been very underweight duration for a while. And coming into the year, yields were so low there was just no cushion to offset any rising rates. This is the first quarter where we've sort of upped our duration. So we have two strategies, one is the floating-reachered U.S. of FAR. It's been the best play for rising fed. We've also had a yield enhanced core, AGGY, which is just a little bit longer duration than the ag. We sort of moved some from the floating-reachered to the yield enhanced core at our recent rebalance across a lot of our models. We're still underweight duration. We're saying we're not ready to fully join the duration party. We're still short duration versus our benchmarks. But we sort of cut the gap in half because we do now think yields are very different. You've got a few hundred basis points increase in real yields. There's really now yield back in fixed income. The high yield market, you get 8 to 9% yields. So it's just a very different story than what you started the year. And so we did cut that duration gap in half in a lot of our model portfolios. And Matt, you said you still expect a couple of elevated CPI reports based on the back of housing Y. And what are you seeing overall in the housing sector that gives you a sense of where the entire economy might be headed? Yeah, this is a really critical point to make here about housing is that housing flows into CPI with about a year and a half lag. So what you're seeing in CPI right now in the services component, a third of which is housing is what we saw in the housing market in 2021. And we all remember what housing looked like last year where annualized gains were 20% or higher. But it's a very completely different story as we look at what the housing market looks like this year. From where we started this year up until this week, mortgage purchase demand is off 37%. And the month on month gains in the housing market are history. We've gone from a month on month gains of 1 1 1 2% to negative territory over the summer. And considering where affordability is and where mortgage rates have been trending this quarter, it's likely that we're going to see further declines. And so that's going to take some time to filter into overall headline inflation and core inflation. But the question is, is whether policymakers at the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world will look to more of a forward looking indication of where inflation is going, not the stale inflation that we're likely to see, which is going to be elevated for the next couple of quarters because, again, housing moves into the numbers with about a year to year and a half lag. Matt, given all the uncertainty that you were just talking about in the market, some of the challenges that investors are facing right now, what do you like? That's a good question. I think the diversification is your best friend and volatile markets. And we agree with Jeremy that a lot of value has been restored into the bond market. And so while it's been a painful reprise this year, invests with great corporates around a five-year mark or trading between five and a half percent, that provides you some cushion against traditional equities. Within equities, the position we've had for the last couple of years is to be tilting our portfolios towards cheaper parts of the market. And we think that's still an attractive place to be invested. Value spreads continue to be historically wide. And so if you think that a recession is coming in 2023 and our base cases that we do have some sort of a mild recession, there's a lot of cushion already built into the price. A sector neutral value implementation, the large cap space, trades less than nine times for looking earnings. And so even if estimates get cut significantly for that basket of equities that I just mentioned, you still have a lot of cushion because it's only, like I said, nine times earnings. All right, good stuff. Matt Stuckie, Jeremy Schwartz, appreciate you both being here. Wonderful breakdown there. Coming up the best drama in the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,87,2022-10-06 20:08:57
2769," Thanks. All right. Good stuff. Matt Stucki, Jeremy Schwartz. Appreciate you both being here. A wonderful break down there. Coming up, the best drama in the world of business, the latest in the Elon Musk Twitter saga right after a short break. Good food. All right, the latest in the juicy Asalga in the business world, that of course, the back and forth between Elon Musk and Twitter will he or won't he? Elon's lawyers now asking a Delaware court to halt the upcoming trial, which starts October 17th over his deal to acquire Twitter at 5420 per share. We have senior reporter for the Wall Street Journal Carol Lamartha with us to discuss what's next in this deal. Caraguthus here, you've been all over this deal. Will we see Elon Musk deposed as early as Monday? That's currently the big question. I think that's why the two sides are deep in talks. They're hoping to, I believe, reach an agreement before them. I don't think either side wants to go through with that at this point, but still a possibility as of this moment. Karen, you've done some reporting here. You're now saying that Elon Musk reporting that Elon Musk is now saying that he wants this all contingent on whether or not he receives the necessary jet financing. What can you tell us about that? And I guess just a likelihood or unlikely, that that's going to happen, given how different the market is today compared to how it was when you initially struck this deal. So that wasn't a condition of the initial deal, but interestingly when his lawyers sent a two sentence letter to Twitter on Monday, surprising us all and saying, let's just do the deal on the original terms, he threw in this new financing condition. And so that is where the talks this week have really centered around. Now as far as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,88,2022-10-06 20:13:07
2770," the deal on the original terms, he threw in this new financing condition. And so that is where the talks this week have really centered around. Now, as far as the idea of the banks having an out, that is not something I'm hearing and awful lot about. I think that would be very unlikely. They have a reputational risk. They would need to deal with it. They were to try to pull out of this deal. I think it's more that it's just another bargaining chip for him in these negotiations at the moment. How short are estimates that Elon Musk, how short is he of the 5420 per share? How much Tesla shares do we figure he may have to sell? That's a great question. He's already sold a large chunk, as you know. And to finance his equity portion, he's personally on the hook for over $30 billion worth of equity. Now he has a few friends and business acquaintances that have agreed to help with that. But they're not obliged to do it the way he is. So he may need to sell even more shares at the end. Kira, what's your best guess just in terms of whether or not this does go to trial? How long could potentially take to close and whether or not you have confidence? That it will, in fact, close and go through this time. So right now, the two scenarios that I think people are looking at are the following. One, they could reach a deal this weekend ahead of Monday, in which they agreed to put the lawsuit on hold and hopefully close the deal by the end of the month. The other scenario involves they don't reach a deal. They go to trial. That's five days starting the week after next. We'll probably get a decision within a few weeks. You would assume that if the decision is bad for Musk, he would probably appeal it. That would take a few additional weeks. We would probably have clarity by the end of the year. But then we'd still need to hold a potential vote on it if any of the terms changed or get all the conditions in place for the deal to close. So that would be a much more drawn out close. Any sense if Elon is still trying to reduce this deal from the $54.20, the $44 billion price tag? So that's an excellent question. As you know, we reported before his letter on Monday saying let's just do it at the original price. They were in deep discussions about a price cut. So anytime there's negotiating going on between two sides, I just assume any term is any possible term changes still on the table. I wouldn't rule it out as things move around, but I haven't heard that it's a focus of the discussions as they stand today. Karen, we've been following your reporting very closely. We will continue to follow it. Thanks so much for having on with us and giving us the latest. Karen Lombardo, the Wall Street Journal.

2771,"és Well, if you're in the market for a Ford F-150 Lightning EV, the task is getting tougher and the price tag higher, Ford raising the price. The second time in as many months, this week by $5,000, the starting price now, $519,740, up 11% from the previous price hike and 30% more than in May of 21. Senior Auto's reporter, Prouds, who remaining here with more on this story, Prouds, good to see you. What are we learning? Dave, you mentioned that second price hike there for that base model, the Ford F-150 Lightning EV. Ford announced that truck had a sub-40,000 price tag, a shot across the bow to the industry that we can make this truck for cheap. But you know what, it seems like things are getting in the way, namely inflation. I spoke to an auto analyst named Sam Fiorani at AutoFourCast Solutions. He's a big car manufacturing expert. He told me that Ford had no choice but to do this. It wasn't sustainable for them with inflation and part shortages. He said it was an in-ocertune time when Ford came out. He said, I'm from F-150 Lightning because of the fact that we started having inflation hit the economy. You know, you can't, you also, you said you can't blame Ford here because it's not an execution problem. GM and Tesla also having problems at pricing. We saw Tesla Royce prices. We saw GM say that their Ford Equinox is not, I'm sorry, there are seven Equinox. It's not going to be below 30, but around $30,000. So, you know, you can't actually blame Ford here because of what's happening as an industry by a problem. But there is a silver lining here and he said that perhaps by raising prices, Ford can actually invest in their EV transition more fully. And then also potentially, we might be able to see cheaper EVs down the road. But you know, it's hard to say right now to Ford F-150 Lightning Reservation holders were going to see a bigger price tag when they finally get that truck. Yeah, with that demand, they've got a lot of pricing power there. Prowse, thank you. Shana. All right, Dave, access to funding and concerns about credit availability are two big challenges. Minority business owners are facing today. And so, according to a new report from Bank of America and Shark Tank's Damon John is looking to help his announced plans for the third annual Black Entrepreneurs a day that will feature big names, including Spike Lee, Venus Williams and Shaqille O'Neill. We want to bring in Damon John, the Shark Group, a CEO and founder of Black Entrepreneurs Day. Damon, it's great to see you. Once again, and have you back here on Yahoo Finance. Congratulations on the announcement that you made today, the third annual Black Entrepreneurs Day. Just give us a sense right now. This of course happening later this month at a time when the economy is slowing down, business conditions are changing very rapidly. Give us a sense of just what you're hearing from business owners and entrepreneurs today. Yeah, I think, I mean, listen, you report and I'm hearing it a lot from watching you. You know, with inflation and everybody being squeezed and we're just looking at the challenges with Ford Tesla and everybody else. The supply chain is still being somewhat bottlenecked and figured out. It's getting tougher out there. You know, and that's the challenge and that's why as I launched Black Entrepreneurs Day for the third year, it's about access to capital and it's about more information on how to operate a business these days because we still have to start cutting and the cutting is not over.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,90,2022-10-06 20:22:09
2772," the day for the third year, it's about access to capital and it's about more information on how to operate a business these days because we still have to start cutting and the cutting is not over. I think we have a we have some time to keep cutting because these prices in inflation and the supply chain is problematic. Yeah, shocking. A day to see 40% of black business owners say they think they'll never have equal access to capital. Is that problem getting better and the people that might be at your conference? Shaquille O'Neill, Venus let alone her sister Serena Spike Lee, how are they changing that atmosphere? Well, it is somewhat getting better in one sense, but on the flip side, you know, it's not. You know, a lot of people, a lot of corporations after George Floyd had donated a lot of funds and it was an internal mandate to go out there and to address some of these matters. That's why we love working with JP Morgan Chase, Walter Management and they have their criteria as to deploy 30 billion over the next couple of years, but a lot are pulling back, you know, they're pulling back because they're looking at these things in line item. I'm not taking it personally. They're saying, hey, if we got to reduce our, you know, a lot of stuff we're doing by 30%. Well, something like these type of programs, they're just looked at as line item. They cut them when we always say that the people who need the most get cut the first and that's something that needs to, that needs to be readdressed because when more issues come around, they're going to be the ones with their pants down and the press and a lot of people are holding them, you know, holding them to their word of what did you say about two years ago? Now, why should Kilo Neal Spike Lee and Venus are honest to have people identify with people who are in great positions, but to talk more about their losses and where they failed and how they overcame those things and how they had to continue to educate themselves because many of us African Americans did not come from what legacy wealth. So our parents and grandparents could not share this information or wanting to, you know, scale back and deal with tough times like this. And David, talking about empowering these business owners, showing them what success looks like. I guess, how do you better prepare them for the future? We talk about the fact that access to funding is so, is so tough for many minorities that the numbers are pretty drastic, just the gap between access to funding. Guess what do we need to do in order to close that gap? Well, the challenges, what you need to do is any entrepreneur, whether African American or not is you have to constantly educate yourself on how to improve your business. And often that is the structure of your business. A lot of times when I meet with entrepreneurs, they literally cannot take in the capital because they don't have quick books or they don't have other sources so I can really trace where the money came from and where my money is going. A lot of times is internal structure and then it's always like any other business going back to what is the core of your business. I know, you know, I believe that we should always spend 20% on looking forward into improving the business and then, but at times like this, you need to go full out on who is your customer, why are you and how you offer providing for them? Where can you cut the fat and make it through these times? You get as lean as possible. You have a restaurant stop becoming a ghost kitchen in various other things like that. And you got to recalibrate your business because you got to get lean right now because winter is coming. You built the iconic clothing brand Foubu. Another icon, frankly, has been Kanye West, what he's done with Yeezy up 30% in 21.1 billion to a deed is alone, let alone his partnership with Gap. He's been very critical of both those relationships, Damon. And today we learned from the Wall Street Journal that his partnership with Adidas has been put under review. The problem is certainly not access to capital for Kanye. What is do you think? I think there's a communication through what Kanye expects, you know, and is everybody on the team from the top down in line with that and did they agree upon that? You know, businesses, it's moving often, right? And when the things were good and everything was going great, that's fine. But when supply chain issues come and or maybe they have over inventory or they order too much, well, they're going to have to adjust those numbers. And as much as Kanye is, you know, somebody who's leading it, you know, the theory of business who pays the most says the most, you know, and if Adidas and those people have massive amount of inventory, they have to let go or they have to start cutting prices to retailers or not, you know, they don't have the people walking through their doors anymore. You know, you've got to make adjustments. So I don't know what those agreements are and I'll leave it up to all of them, but it's not always as one side is what we see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,91,2022-10-06 20:26:15
2773," all into their doors anymore. You know, you got to make adjustments. So I don't know what those agreements are. And I'll leave it up to all of them, but it's not always as one side is. What we see, Kanye happens to have a loud voice, but we haven't really heard from the people who are dealing with the supply chain and all the other things that they have challenges with. Damien, sticking with retail, another consumer facing brand I want to ask you about is Peloton because once again, today they're in the news announcing another round of cuts, a fourth round of job cuts this year. From your perspective, I guess, what does a company like Peloton? What do they need to do in order to turn things around and get investors back on board? That's a really good question. I thought Peloton would have been sold a long time ago because they happen to have a captivated audience, 45 minutes to an hour on viewing the screen. And I would have thought that one of the Netflix of the world, the Amazon's of the world would have just grabbed them due to eyeballs. So that's still not off the table at the moment, but I really don't know what they could do right now. I think that's over my pay gradient because they are suffering and I did invest in Peloton not after the bump, but after it brought it back down, but it kept going back down. And I'm like, what the hell did I do? So I wish I had the answers to that, but I don't have the answer to that. It has been interesting watching, just sipping from a fire hose, the amount of news coming out of there. Damien, you often quote Elon Musk and talk about his leadership style and his innovation over the recent years. What do you make of the latest twist in turn? Suddenly he's back in on buying Twitter. I think he's a sharp negotiator, and Elon has always three or four steps ahead. He's already had, he has a plan for this thing and I think he's just basically doing what we all do. You go to the house, you put a bid on it, you get everybody out of the way and then you start setting the engineers in there and you find out all the things that you would like to have adjusted sooner or later, before the seller gets seller's fatigue or you get them to go down on pricing and you get them where you want them. So I think it's just a negotiation and the crazy thing is he's using the same exact platform that he's purchasing to help negotiate what he wants to do. He's brilliant, I will never try to think ahead of Elon Musk. Yeah, Damien, I guess just your reaction now has handled this acquisition so far and also heading into a company where the culture is obviously has gone through many rollercoaster rides to say the least over the last several months as someone who has a very successful track record. I guess how do you kind of write that ship? How do you write the ship of their culture? Yes. Challenging at the moment, you have to almost get to the theory of crashing and burning or slashing all leadership because it really comes from a leadership standpoint and getting all the old guards out of the way. And because today is very hard to get at workforce that really wants to work for you. They want to work for culture, they want to work for purpose. So I believe that it's really going to be cleaning house and you get there of all the people that are at the top. All right, Damien, John, wanted to say you did a great job on Mask Singer. You're looking spelt, Matt. And you look like you have really been working it out, brother. Good to see you. Black Entrepreneurs Day, October 27th at New York City's Apollo Theater, the website blackentrepreneursday.com. Please check it out the deadline, the 12th. Good to see you, sir. All right, come on up next. We're going to take a quick break here. When we come back, OPEC plus cuts on the rise in the Biden administration reported looking elsewhere from oil will tell you where next. Drink some water today up to the stage,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,92,2022-10-06 20:30:46
2774," Sorry. All right, with OPEC Bloss following through with historic production cuts of two million barrels a day, where will the United States go to offset those cuts? According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the answer just might be Venezuela. That will involve the loosening of sanctions with the Maduro regime. Scott Bauer is the CEO of Prosper Trading Academy. Let's talk about this with him good to see a Scott. So first, the White House pushing back a little bit on this this morning saying it's premature to suggest sanctions relief. What's your reaction to the cuts and the potential for dealing with the Maduro regime to offset them? Well, I think it's very dangerous and it's dangerous because they've been in talks or at least they started talks at the beginning of the Russia, Ukraine, war back in March. So we're talking it's been six or seven months. I don't even want to say negotiation, but since those talks have started and we haven't really gotten anywhere and it sure seems that this is an afterthought, almost, in a reaction to the cuts that we saw yesterday from OPEC Plus. So maybe this is going to happen, but it certainly puts the United States in my opinion in a position they don't want to be and something that they don't want to do in terms of giving up sanctions or quite frankly having to trust Maduro and the regime that they're going to come to the table and that they are going to meet the opposition and talk about legitimate elections in the future. So I think we're not in a great spot with this. So Scott, they're looking at doing this in order to boost supply. I guess how much of an effect do you see this potentially having on prices? Right, so that effect is not going to come quickly either. The state of drilling is in shambles in Venezuela. There has been a very long time where there hasn't been anything going on and even Chevron, who's the big driller going to have to get in there, it's going to take them months to get up and running. So in the near term, it has no effect whatsoever on adding any supply to the marketplace. We're talking probably three to six months down the road. Now, maybe if it happens, maybe the market looks at that and says, okay, that's good enough. We know that there's going to be some pain right now, but maybe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,93,2022-10-06 20:35:00
2775," the six months down the road. Now, maybe if it happens, maybe the market looks at that and says, OK, that's good enough. We know that there's going to be some pain right now, but, you know, maybe by the end of the year or first quarter next year, we know there's going to be this supply coming back on. But even when Venezuela was in their full production, that was 3 million barrels a day. So, you know, let's say we get a third of that back, maybe half of that back, you're looking at a million to a million and a half a day, what's that is up and running? Of course, all this matters depends upon your interpretation of those OPEC plus cuts, which they say are around 2 million barrels a day. Again, Amos Hoxtine told CNBC this morning, he thinks it's closer to 900,000, but he said he'd actually be surprised if there's any net cut at the end eventually anyway, and it shouldn't have a massive impact on prices. What do you make of that? I actually agree with that, and that's because they haven't hit their quota. So, that 2 million number that they're floating out there, because they haven't hit their quotas now, that's why we see that actual reduction, if you will, the 900,000 or a million. Quite frankly, I'm surprised that the market reacted the way it did, that it's not more of a buy the rumor sell the news type of event. I understand why crude went up after the announcement yesterday morning. I would have thought we would have actually seen it fall back a little as the market really digested, what you just mentioned, that 2 million number is really not 2 million. Scott, what do you think this all means for gas prices going up, looking down the line here? The average national average today is 387 up about 4 cents from yesterday up 9 cents from the last week. Are we going to be back above $4 soon? Yeah, I think we're going to see that probably within the next couple of weeks. And, you know, it's that chicken and egg thing when we see crude prices go down, yeah, gas prices go down a little bit or takes them a long time. Now, all of a sudden, you know, over the last week, 10 days, we've seen crude prices rising. And man, we've seen, at least where I live, probably 40 to 50 cents a gallon higher. It just the last week. So, yes, I think sooner rather than later, I would bet even by the end of next week, we're back above the average of $4 a gallon. Bad news here for consumers. All right, Scott Bauer, great to speak with you. Thanks so much for joining us. Have a good day. Thank you, Sean, for some big breaking news now on cannabis reform. President Biden announcing about an hour ago that the administration will pardon all federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. They'll also urge states governors to do the same and ask the HHS secretary and attorney general to reexamine how cannabis is scheduled. As you might expect, shares of marijuana stocks soaring on this news. We are talking a minimum increase around 20 percent for a lot of the big names and check it out here. Or a canopy cure leaf, green thumb and true leaf. And the biggest gainer on the day is with us now. True leaf up 36 percent on this news. We're joined now by the CEO of True Leaf, Kim Rivers. Kim, nice to see you. First, there had been a lot of negative sentiment regarding the abide administration and how they handled cannabis just your reaction to this U-turn. Well, I mean, better late than never. That's what I would say. And I'm really thankful that President Biden did step up and fulfill one of his campaign promises, which was, of course, as he stated early on that no one should be in jail for cannabis use or possession. So we've gotten the possession side of things at the federal level today, which, of course, is historic and is very, very important. And so I do want to pause and say, you know, thank you. And hopefully this is the first of many steps in the right direction as it relates to reform. I'm also very hopeful that, of course, the governors will follow suit at the state level as there are many, many more folks incarcerated at the state level for possession as well. And so hopefully that will, this will, this will start a movement there. President Biden tweeting, as I've said before, no one should be in jail for just using or possessing marijuana. Today I'm taking",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,94,2022-10-06 20:39:05
2776," This will start a movement there. President Biden tweeting, as I've said before, no one should be in jail for just using or possessing marijuana. Today, I'm taking steps to end our failed approach. Let's talk about the third aspect here, which is examining the scheduling of cannabis. How significant is that news? You know, that's again, that is historic and monumental. As President Biden correctly pointed out, currently marijuana is scheduled the same as heroin. I think we can all agree that that is simply laughable at this point. There are millions of Americans who utilize cannabis legally under state programs today for health and well-being, and of course, also recreationally under adult use programs as alternatives to alcohol as an example. And so, you know, certainly it sends a strong signal that this administration is taking proactive steps to re-examine how this country has categorized marijuana historically. And again, hopefully this is the beginning of a conversation that is long overdue as it relates to significant and substantive reform. Kim, clearly investors are optimistic of federal legalization. We mentioned your stock popping 36% on this news. Are you more optimistic of legalization than you were a few hours ago? You know, I think that this this market in the sector has been fairly held back as a result of the lack of federal action. I think that, you know, coming into a democratic controlled house in Congress coupled with a presidency who ran on promises of cannabis reform. The sector has been stagnated and waiting for, you know, a substantive step forward, which I think was provided today. So, you know, there has been a lot of work that's been done in both chambers and actually by bipartisan work that's been done in both chambers and conversations around substantive frameworks. And again, this is going to take some work. So I do want to say that because it is a complex issue and we do need to make sure that we get it right and that we are thoughtful and comprehensive and that we are and have a resulting ecosystem that is encompassing and is one that is sustainable. But certainly I am encouraged for sure that this is that first step that I believe that the market and certainly that we have been we have been looking for. I'm hearing cautious optimism. Give me a time frame. How long do you think we are before federal legalization? And the biggest obstacle here has been just getting safe banking through the Senate past the House now a half a dozen times. When can that get done? Well, so, you know, certainly safe banking is is teed up and ready to go. It has been for quite some time. It's been past numerous occasions on numerous occasions in the House. Of course, on the Senate, there's been a lot of conversation around, you know, safe banking as a standalone or safe banking paired with some sort of additional criminal justice reform. I'm actually expungement is it was a was a and certainly making sure that we have we have remedies for folks who are in prison to this today actually is a big step to help that. And perhaps will then, you know, is for an action on safe banking, which we certainly were hopeful would happen before the end of the year. I can tell you that in terms of full blown legalization and again, that is going to take some work. We do need to make sure that it is a thoughtful program that is, you know, does ensure that folks who are currently utilizing cannabis are able to continue and that we are we are thoughtful about how that product is regulated and that is safety, of course, is a paramount concern. And then also again, the ecosystem that's developed as one that is inclusive and diverse. And again, I just I think that we do need to make sure that we can all stand behind that result. But in terms of when that can happen, and there are a lot of measures in the legislature that have been drafted, and there are bills that are literally sitting and waiting waiting to go. There's framework bills, there's bills that address, you know, research and safety. And so there's there's a lot of work that that is ready and can come to fruition quickly. If the political will is there to actually dig in and lean into this issue and begin and begin to get some things passed out. So I think that again, press.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,95,2022-10-06 20:43:20
2777," If the political will is there to actually dig in and lean into this issue and begin to get some things passed out. So I think that, again, President Biden's support in his signaling that he is willing to spend some political capital on this and to – in a signal to Congress that this is an issue that's important, which it should be because it's important to the American voters. You know, the American acceptance rate, as it relates to cannabis, has only increased since President Biden has been in office. Pull after pull shows that Americans want legal reform and legal access to cannabis. So no surprise there. And again, hopeful that this is the first of many steps to come. Been searching for Republican reaction. Can't find much. Congresswoman Nancy Mays did tweet, applaud the administration for their necessary big step forward and bringing justice to so many. She is one of the few Republican supporters in the House of cannabis legislation still waiting for some Senate comments. Truly CEO Kim Rivers. Nice to see you as always. Thank you. Thank you. All right, coming up. The auto is using AI to help people level up their skills and advance their careers. The company CEO joined us next to tell us how they're doing. All right. Advanced in your career or moving to a new industry can be confusing and stressful. But what if artificial intelligence could assess your skill set and connect you with the training and certifications that you would need? That's precisely what our next guest company, Otto, aims to do, joining us now for more on that we want to bring in the founder and a CEO of Otto Milan of Cortistani for today's installment of Career Control brought to you by straight talk wireless. Milan is great to see you. Just talk to us, I guess, first just give us a groundwork of what exactly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,96,2022-10-06 20:48:00
2778," for today's installment, a career control brought to you by straight talk wireless monitoring. To see you, just talk to us, I guess, first, just give us a groundwork of what exactly auto is and how the AI exactly works. Thank you for having us, Johnna. I'm really excited to be here. So basically what we do with the AI is, we have to start by understanding who you are as an individual. So we assess you on your personality and it's all sorts of traits from how artistic you are realistic and enterprising. And then the next component is understanding what past experience you have. It could be being a waitress, it could be being a farmer, which is what I did before I went into, you know, working in tech, but truthfully, whatever it is, we understand what your experience is and we run all of that information against a massive database of resumes to see where is their overlap in, where you are today, with where you want to go and how can we help you understand what those skills are that are monetizable and in demand in today's marketplace and recommend the right curriculum from across the internet and our partners to be able to recommend the right courses to quickly up-skill you and make you valuable again in the marketplace and competitive. Well, who's your target audience or these people that are just entering the workforce have only been in the workforce for a few years or are also people going to use auto that have been in a job for maybe 10, 12 years and they're looking to change what they're doing today. So our focus today is on 18 to 24-year-olds, individuals that are currently trying to find more alternative solutions than the current university and college route. However, the truth is as we start to scale out and our AI becomes more intelligent at realizing what success looks like at different stages of people's careers, we'll be able to take anyone and even an individual that may have been out of the workforce for say 10 years after being some expert of a sort and helping them identify what are the one or two skills that we could help you find and train to then be really competitive in the job market. Milan, presumably there was a problem with the way this is happening now that you were looking to solve. What is the breakdown in the way people are choosing careers where we stand today? Sure. So right now there isn't much clarity into how an individual that is going on after high school to figure out where they want to go with their career and what it is that they want to do beyond a college advisor or the SAT kind of helping determine which school you could get into. And likewise, when you're on LinkedIn or indeed or any of these platforms really where you keep all of your information about your past experience, that information is never used to help you understand what you're missing when you don't land a job. And that's what we want to do. We're here to use data for good and gamification to basically help you understand why it is you don't land a job when you apply for it. By knowing what a competitor that did land that job, what it was that they had as a skill and what we can do to help make you more competitive the next time. So say someone out there right now wants to get started. Where do they start? How much does it cost? How involved is the process? So if you're interested right now in one of the three career tracks we offer, which are in digital marketing, software engineering and graphic design, you could come to auto.com and you sign up and you'll be able to, after joining our wait list as we're in beta right now, you'll be able to essentially take our AI assessment and we'll start by figuring out who you are and then recommending the courses for you to get started. We have a membership that starts at $12 and that helps you get significant discounts on all of the curriculum we offer. But even for users who are not members of ours, they can come to auto and they can take courses at the same price as any of our partners online or better guaranteed. All right, auto founder and CEO Milan Kordistani really appreciate a good stuff you're doing there. Thanks. Shout out over to you. What's moving after hours, my friend? All right, Dave, we have two stocks here in focus. Let's kick it off with Levi's and talk off just about 5% the company lowering its full year forecast citing the strong dollar supply chain disruptions two things that are clouding the company's outlook right now. They cut their full year adjusted EPS and net revenue growth guidance for the year third quarter numbers though, we're actually not that bad. EPS coming in better than expected 40 cents. The street was looking for an estimate of 37 cents revenue just a bit like 1.5 billion estimate there was for one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,97,2022-10-06 20:52:10
2779," That bad EPS coming in better than expected 40 cents. The street was looking for an estimate of 37 cents revenue just a bit like 1.5 billion estimate there was for 1.6 billion in terms of the three month movement in this stock. Not too bad up about 1% relatively speaking. That's actually pretty strong here to date though. The stock in the red off just around 36%. Let's take a look at AMD here. AMD under pressure after hour. There are some of its competitors, a company coming out cutting its third quarter revenue guidance. They cited the weak PC market and also quote significant inventory corrections throughout the PC supply chains. We're seeing AMD off just about three and a half percent right now they now see third quarter revenue at 5.6 billion. The initial estimate was for 6.7 billion. Certainly has been a tough couple of months for AMD because you can see the stock off 33% in just the past two months alone year to date of just over 52%. Right after we got this news from AMD after hour some of its biggest competitors and video Intel are also under pressure after hours following the news. So AMD cutting a third quarter revenue guidance was shares off just over 3%. Dave. All right. Thank you. Shout out to you. I'm watching for tomorrow and what the Fed is indeed watching tomorrow. All these September jobs report, the forecast is for 250,000 jobs created. The unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7%. That's all according to definitive. Now 315,000 jobs are added in August. Still a very strong number but well below the average of more than a half million over the last 12 months. The ADP data we got yesterday and I showed private companies created 208,000 jobs in September. While earlier this week we got the Joel to the number of open positions slipped by more than 1 million. The September report also expected to show hourly earnings growth has decelerated albeit slightly to 5.1% from 5.2. And lastly we will focus on that all important labor force participation rate most recently clocking in at 62.4 as you can see below the pre pandemic level. Taking a break here but when we come back consumers may soon learn a lot about what's inside the alcoholic beverage they're consuming. Find out when we come back. Thanks a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,98,2022-10-06 20:56:23
2780," We want to get to some breaking news here. Following the reporting say is going to submit for personal currencies. And then saying they had so for 20 a share this month saying that, quote, Twitter will not take yes for an answer. So again, Twitter responding here after hours, you're seeing the stock up just around 710s of a percent. All right. Well, it is about that time of day where we start thinking about what we might be drinking tonight. And it's Thursday, maybe about what you're going to be drinking this weekend. Reportedly, the Treasury Department wants to know what's in what we are drinking, responding to a lawsuit by the Consumer Federation of America. The Department may push for beer wine and spirits companies to display calorie counts involving sizes and ingredients on their labels. Indeed, there are some beer industry, some players in the beer industry that do this on a voluntary basis. There's been some pushback from wine makers. Josh, our producer, looked up, Avaco soda. That's what I like to drink when I'm out having some fun. Has 133 calories for 225 grams serving. That's a lot more than what I was expecting to be. I don't think I'm a fan of this labeling for alcohol. What do you think? I'm a huge fan of this happening. I think this is long overdue. 95% of beers already do this voluntarily. I have a problem with the spirits industry in particular, although I texted it to Stiller in my area. He said, oh, this will increase the cost of doing business more regulations, slow down product development. Here's Koss Amigos, the leading Tequila brand on the market from George Clooney. And if you turn it around, we don't know what's in it. And I talk to a lot of liquor store owners who are concerned. They want to know not only the calorie count, they want to know the ingredients. Here's another one. This is the rocks brand, Taremana, very different on the backside. He breaks it all down from what's in it to the amount of alcohol per serving, serving size. I think this is long overdue. But David, it has not stopped you from drinking. Both of those bottles almost gone, very, very little bit left. All right, that'll do it for us. For Shana, I'm Dave. We will see tomorrow at 3 o'clock Eastern time. Bye.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahmy7qqS3zQ,99,2022-10-06 21:00:50
