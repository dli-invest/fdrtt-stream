That's Because a lot of the shops that are heading the economy are on the supply side rather than the demand site first And secondly that a lot of those supply shops are globally nature been relate to the pandemic or they relate to Russia Warren Ukraine or other factors and so they understood things central banks used to dealing with or particularly good at forecasting Certainly makes it an additional difficult time now The right approach for the vets taken this environment ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03GGAVD1MgM,57,2022-09-21 17:53:24

It sounds like you think that that makes sense. I think that the federal reserves responsibility is risk management No economist generally think that what really matters for the economy is the interest rate relative to the level of inflation So that means if inflation's running at four and a half percent five% And our workers and their families and small companies are expecting a place to continue at five% Even a three% or a four% interest rate is not actually that tight.

The labor force participation rate showed a welcome uptick in August But his little change since the beginning of the year. FMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time Using the upward pressure on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to four. Four% at the end of next year a half percentage going higher than in the June projections. Over the next 3 years the median unemployment rate runs above the meeting estimate of its longer run normal level. Inflation remains well above our two% longer run goal. Over the 12 months ending in July total PCE prices rose six. Three% Excluding the vault of food and energy categories core PCE prices rose four. Six%. In August the 12 month change in consumer in the consumer price index was eight. Three% in the changing course CPI was six. Three% Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services. Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months they remain well above your earlier levels in part reflecting Russia's war against Ukraine which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03GGAVD1MgM,67,2022-09-21 18:38:29

Nine% by the end of 2025 still above the median estimate of it's longer run value Of course these projections do not represent a committee decision or plan and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our two% goal and to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth. And it will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to step to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. We will keep at it until we're confident the job is done. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country Everything we do is in service to our public mission We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.

I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how you'll know when to slow down. These rate increases and how you'll eventually know when to stop.

1725,"Financial conditions begin to affect Economic activity fairly quickly within a few months but it's likely to take some time to see the full full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation. So, we are we are very much mindful for that. And that's why I know that in my in my opening remarks that Some point as the stance of policy tightens further it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our accumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation So, that's how we think about that. Your second question, sorry was I should know better than tonight. Alright. Question. Oh, there you go. Is it linear do you keep raising major is there a pause that you could envision where you kinda figure out what what has happened to the economy and give time to catch up in the real economy the rate of which stuff to catch up with the real Me. Thank you. So so I think I think it's it's very hard to say with the precise certainty the way this is gonna unfold. As I mentioned what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that's restrictive enough To bring inflation down to two% where we have confidence of that and what you see in the SEP numbers is people's views as of as of today as of this meeting as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now, those those those will those will evolve over time And I think we'll we'll we'll just have to to see how that goes.

And a soft landing would be would be very challenging and and we don't know no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be that's gonna depend on How quickly wage in price and flesh inflation pressures come down whether expectations remain anchored and whether you know also do we get more labor supply which would help as well. In addition, the chances of a soft lending landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive. Or restrictive for longer. Nonetheless we're committed to getting inflation back down to two%. It will because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean for a greater pain later on. Do you still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there? Yes vacancies are still almost two to one ratio two unemployed people that's a that and quits are are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different From other cycles where which where the generally the unemployment rate itself is the is a single best indicator we think those things have for a quite a time now Really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is.

We didn't vote on that. I would say that, you know, we're committed to getting to a restrictive level Of For the federal funds rate and getting their pretty quickly And that's what we're thinking about Some discussion now Of overdoing it. What's the incentive to continue front loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still stronger So what what we've seen is inflation has our expectation has been that We would begin to see inflation come down largely because of of supply side healing by now we would have thought to that we've who would have seen some of that we haven't we have seen some supplies side healing but inflation has not really come down if you At Core PCE inflation which is you know a good measure of where inflation is running now if you look at it on a three six and 12 month trailing annualized basis you'll see that That inflation is at 4845%, and four. Eight%. So, that's those that's a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation And that's not where we expected or wanted to be. So, what that tells us is that we we need to continue and we can keep doing these and we did today do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to and we're still discovering what that level is but people are writing that down In the recipe where they think policy needs to be so that that's how that's how we're thinking about it Let's go to Colby.

We typically see jobs growing even during a recession but the labor force grows more. So, it could be bad but it's not necessarily as bad as those numbers would seem to suggest and I think ideally given the strength that the economy and the job market, Probably where it's gonna come from not mass job losses but simply slower growth. And staying on this trajectory at Pal said that no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant the recession would be and said that's going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation precious come down when you look at things like wages do we get me indication that they're moving Rexton at the Fed wants right now We've seen real wage growth in particular go negative and that's obviously most we do to inflation but we're not seeing too much in the way of the mitigation of wages and more to the point when you combine wage growth with job growth when you look at the total growth in purchasing power we're not seeing any mitigation at all.

The questions gonna be do we get enough of a pullback and everything else Supply chain has healed but We're probably gonna see increasing but more slowly increasing inflation at least through the end of the year.

The chairman holding the line on inflation doubling down on his message made at Jackson Hole back in August that the fed will do whatever it takes until they're confident inflation is under control even if that means with standing a bit of pain, take a listen If we wanna set ourselves up really really light the way to another period of very strong labor market we have got to get inflation behind us I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't. So, what we need to do is get rates up to to the point where we're putting meaningful downward pressure On inflation And that's where we're that's what we're doing Cheer Pell saying that the Fed has just gotten to a restrictive policy stance and that they need to get to a meetingful level both in inhold rates there until inflation comes down of ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03GGAVD1MgM,80,2022-09-21 19:34:50

They were consistent throughout saying, look, inflation, if it doesn't come down, everything else is coming secondary there. Looking at the equity markets they still focusing on unemployment and that two% target so we just have to keep our fingers crossed by don't think equity markets are gonna be too too happy with that for a while no when you look at those numbers at the bottom of your screen they continue to go down continue to decline it looks like deeper into the red and just one more thing on the housing He did say that was the one obvious example that they are having success but again we talk a lot about Across the country but we're still talking about Increases cooling.

So, the deceleration, housing prices that we're seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rans and other housing market fundamentals. And you know, that's a good thing. For the longer term, what we Is supply and demand to get better lines so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level at a reasonable pace and that people are gonna afford houses again and I think we so we probably in the housing market have to go through a correction to get back to that place.

Yo, if you're, if you're tracking the rates, you're long-term rates have actually come down a little bit after the feds announced in today. We'll see if they, they stay in that territory. But there's usually some variability in the spread between short-term rate And mortgage rates there's a little bit more consistency between 10 year treasury rates and mortgage rates and you know as 10 year trophy rates come down that gives mortgage rates some breathing room we are not necessarily going to see another 75 point basis points surge in mortgage rates but I do think as long as inflation remains rampant as long as we don't Exactly what the endpoint will be for those short term rates that continues to put upward pressure on mortgage rates.

There's, you know, some bright spots in the month of or month data on overall inflation.

Well, for one, I think it's an incredibly Rich time to be investing and fix income especially as you contrast it to the opportunities last year where core rates were ostensibly oh in in spreads weren't much higher than that. You know, at this point, we're finding opportunities where you can invest in two-year triple A rated paper and get get nearly six%. You can buy high quality performing bonds at 80 and ¢90 on the dollar. Have a great Profile and long-term total return. So, like I said, it's gonna continue to be choppy but it's actually a very rich opportunity set for foreign vets sitting in fixed income at this point in time. Well, Christian, what is your assessment just of the bond market right now where Bradley speaking when you take a look Since 2007 the 10 year yield also jumping to its highest level that we've seen in 11 years that trend you don't think that that will stay intact? Again I I don't think we've necessarily put in the tops in terms of rates but you're looking at positive real rates that's that's actually quite attractive and relative to your reviews there's actually a number of ways you can express a high total return potential depending on your views of inflation and fed policy the fed is in this weird place where they're Absolutely will but the fed is trying to look as tough as possible.

If you could tell me what happens in China I'd probably be able to answer that question very well but China has really been a lagered or it's been behaving as though it's in a terrible recession right now if they start you know with the appetite to take up all of the 70s few years. Take the 2023 for examples could be much more expensive than what we saw in the summer of 2022 But i do believe that the bias is toward higher prices for energy as opposed to lower. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03GGAVD1MgM,90,2022-09-21 20:18:13

And Rick you really did call it yesterday when Putin put off that address that we were expecting something big to be coming so then beyond sort of condemning words do we get any sort of sense from the international community How they plan on reacting to this move? Here's the dynamic Putin clearly wants to divide Ukraine's allies and that is part of what this war over energy in Europe is all about. It is to make European citizens is extremely uncomfortable over the winter as uncomfortable as possible so that they increase political support to look can we do something? Can we make some kind of deal Ukraine, so we can resume deliveries of Russian energy. There's there's no indication so far that Putin is able to split support for for Ukraine among its allies and I think one of the thing things President Biden and his team is probably doing at the UN behind the scenes off stage is mastering as much Ongoing support for your crane as they can and that is weapons deliveries obviously but economic aid is really important.

And that's an extremely important part of the narrative Coordinated sanctions that are that have been done right now which are causing enormous financial pain to Vladimir Putin. Yo, let's drill down into that bill sanctions. How effective are they right now and what, you know, what grade would you give them for instance and what do we need to do from here? So I'm I'm a sort of connoisseur of sanctions. It's such a thing exist and so when they first started this sanctions program about a week ago last Tuesday I would have given the Western governments a 2 out of 10. It was all very you know two little too late. Then the atrocities Started to happen and the sanctions started getting real when they added the major Russian banks the Big oil companies etcetera by Thursday it was an aid out of 10 then they did swift that's a 9 out of 10 and then they did vitamin Putin and nine and a half out of 10 so there's still some some gaps that need to be filled in Swift is only done so swift means disconnecting the Russian From the International Financial System and they've only done 70% of the banks and so logic would tell you that if 70% of the banks are disconnected they'll just route all the payments through the 30% of the banks that aren't disconnected that's just ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKJ8iKKfRfs,50,2022-09-22 17:18:05

And that will happen and and they will probably succeed in protecting some of their assets, but even if you don't get all the assets, just having a person on the sanctions list means that they're no longer that they're they're pretty much out of the game. They're benched in the world, in the international financial world. Another remarkable development or correct me if if you think I'm wrong Bill is the is the response by the private sector both in Europe and in the United States I mean everything from Disney to Shell to the banks curtailing or ending their financial relationships with Russia What do you think about that and is this effective Well, in a certain way, I would almost argue it's more effective because okay, so the, you know, the sanctions lists are important. Government activity is important. But if every western company Doing business with the Russians it's it's it's really dramatic I remember when I started my whole campaign for justice for surrogate magnitsky my murdered lawyer one of the first people people I met with I was I was in South Africa and I met with a woman named Helen Zully who is one of the people ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKJ8iKKfRfs,51,2022-09-22 17:22:20

Yeah we were just Murphy's the water of what the fed is trying to do here because obviously while the set is hiking and while the US is on the great past pass it is right now the dollar's gonna get stronger and unfortunately the the fact is that is it crashes the euro and by extension European growth it almost effectively exports Over to Europe and like I mentioned at the beginning of the call, I mean, the global economy is just so interconnected these days. So, you have to really watch the current theater because we have a lot of companies with overseas markets and a lot of European exposure.

Two to $two. 7 billion to cost it's an absolutely amazing press release I get it but now they It might mean as they cut back as they ground planes as they shut sorting facilities and might mean more market share loss to an Amazon more market share laws to UPS and we could very easily be sitting here 6 months from now and it's another earnings FedEx for the next 2 years.

This is just the first showing. So, we'll have to see if they can keep up this pace. But at least right out the game, at least doing well for now, doing very, very well. I think this number is really blowing away a lot of people within the industry. I think they were thinking that Amazon was going to do well. I don't know if people were thinking that they would do this well Right off the bat and even in the release that we got from Amazon earlier this week before we got these numbers that head of sports there basically saying that this has been a resounding success so they are very very excited about the streaming numbers numbers of people tuning in I think the big question down the road is these new prime subscribers talking about Amazon more broad How many how sticky those subscribers are what that number looks like 6 months from now after football season if they're willing to stick around and continue to pay that prime membership I don't know what as they said best 3 hour time frame sign up even topping prime day and one more thing for the advertisers was the average age ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKJ8iKKfRfs,101,2022-09-22 21:01:11

Exactly. Good morning, Julie. So, you know, I think right now, the whole market is focused on the macro outlook. You know, what's gonna happen with the economy as a result of tighter financial conditions and high interest rates?

Hello there, I wanna start with oil prices actually because the move that we are seeing today is fairly remarkable Oil here right now down almost six% for WTI below $80 a barrel so that's the first time we've seen going below that threshold in quite some time here you have the 3 month chart four crude oil prices and this is really feeding over into what we are seeing in terms of the groups within the S and P 500 as well As I'm trying to figure out how to get us to the sectors here. I'm going the wrong direction. Apparently, here we go. As we go down to the sectors, we are seeing energy stocks really under pressure here. Energy stocks down about Right now, they were down as much as six. Four% as a group earlier in the session. So, this again, I really wanna put a fine point on this. This is the best Group of the year. We have been seeing oil prices, slide gasoline at the pump, has slid as we've talked about before for 100 straight days before pausing in that slide, but if this is any indication for what we are seeing with oil prices and energy stocks, we could continue to see a cap on gasoline prices by extension. Here's the year in nature chart. Still 28% for the year. So, really important move here that we are seeing today in energy prices is really a breakdown in the stocks. Consumer discretionary also under pressure today. That's the your date. It's exactly the inverse down 28%. And still down today and then real quick check on builder on the material stocks.

You know, I think that's their goal obviously. I think they're giving away what 45% of their revenue is or their ad revenue is meant to be going towards creators which is I've talked to creators who are in the creator fund for TikTok and they are not seeing numbers even close to that like for a creator to make it on their own what they're often finding is that they have to do some brand deals like they have to work From businesses if they wanna actually make a living off of TikTok.

Well Kiko it's almost impossible to know that and in all honesty none of us know what the real price points gonna be for Netflix we don't know how they're gonna market it Rising price sensitivity amongst Netflix customers and we've seen declining satisfaction at least on their most mature markets like the US and then when we look at what the other streaming companies are doing they're able to generate five to 10 Subscription pricing by 2 to 3 dollars and still generate more revenue per user because they can get $five plus an adreb new per So we got something that kinda addresses the price sensitivity and is positive for unit economics.

I took that very seriously because suddenly, there was a differentiation between one lot and another. That someone was willing to pay so much to be next for celebrity. Now, with the celebrity, they're gonna do concerts and That's a natural for the verse. So, you might say, well, that's not true of all real estate but there's a proof of concept that people will bid high and pay a lot of money to be near something else and that's what I just see that extension of the Jimmy's the the the ego there because you get to see a real live tiger when you walk through his face and then you see a great portrait of the head of the bank.

We think it's destroyed for next year once a recession. And there's dynamics are are far clear. Now we got some commentary or or speak I believe it was on Friday from from J Pal saying that we might be heading to a new economic normal what is that look like in your estimation And how long might it last Sure so I think we we have two things to focus on from the Fed's perspective. It's the near term how did it deal deal with high inflation, a very tight labor market, and how they get inflation back down closer to two%. That dynamic we think ultimately works its way out with a recession with a Fed tightening bar, aggressively Probably rising to somewhere between five and a half and six% and then I think there's a second Climate change policies are all likely to be supported permanently perspective I think one thing that the economies also currently dealing with is not enough labor supply.

You know, stocks have completed this round trip voyage and and and at their new all-time lows for the year. They rose over the summer but then have come all the way back and European stocks, you know, Andrea into a pair of market as equities rallied from mid June to mid August this year. The currency market was skeptical.

Well, that's hard to say. I think I think one of the concerns is are we going to get a mild recession or a deep one? I think a mild recession is probably more than priced in at this point. The question is, how much deeper is that going to go? Of course, that's very dependent upon central banks. Do they continue to push higher and higher wanting to be the poll volcars of their era until they get Policy rates into real Territory right now.

I think investors wanna focus on quality stocks across sectors not just trying to pick out a sector too that might be out performing one of the ways we've defined quality this year or what we call short duration stocks. Companies that get more of their cash flows in the near term than out over the next several years. So, that's a lower price to cash flow ratio. Those Even in the month of September. So, focusing on that is important. Second, I think high dividend payers. A very similar theme companies paying a high dividend generally a good cash flow and strong balance sheets. Those stocks have been doing very well this year. Not avoided losses but really I've only experienced about half the losses of the overall market. So, it's another theme investors wanna keep in mind. High dividend payers In every sector are outperforming you don't just have to go to those classic high dividend pairs and say utilities or or telecom you can find them even in the text sector the highest dividend pairs are the outperformers Jeffrey, do you have some cash on the sidelines right now like some of our viewers likely do? Are you putting money to work or should investors wait maybe for some of this volatility to calm down? Well I think it I I think you can use volatility as your friend if you if you've got a long time horizon you've got some cash I think dollar cost averaging into this type of a volatile market does make long term sense are they trying to pick a bottom is very hard you know increasingly we're seeing more value even in the bond market despite the sell out there with high yield bonds now yielding over nine% We've got you know divide to the US are now higher than they've been in quite some time.

Right so this is a function of global dynamics global growth dynamics which are just discussed this is also about Central Bank policy the inflation theme and also terms of trade Minus the level expected inflation are moving against European currencies which is pushing them dramatically lower. The thing about sterling what we got is Basically a fiscal package which is there to design to support growth but it comes with basically Tax revenue build up. All of it's supposed to come through economic growth. There's no real challenge to how they're gonna spend money and so basically, there's been a loss of confidence in the guilt market in Sterling.

What do you make of the fact that it has been so resilient and do we need to see it substantially slow in order to get inflation under control? Well it is an issue of supply and demand right we have more people that want to hire people than those that wanna work so that's part of the issue with the inflation and wages what I would say is we are hearing about some layoffs coming up with some companies not all companies but some and those are the individuals Have to be cautious and make sure that they've got an emergency fund a lot of cash on the sidelines to help make up for potential lost wages so it it is a little bit of a balance of two you know cities in Ascends but we'll see what happens that's that's basically what we're looking at for our clients we're telling you to be cautious to be thoughtful and almost to be Boring with where they're putting their money right now.

It's the it can be the shareholders, it can be the customers, it can be employees, and also, so does some extent that people who own Berkshire and own Amazon. I know in all these other corporations will be made worse off and that does include a number of very famous billionaires. And in terms of the sectors that are most exposed. I know we're looking at perhaps manufacturing and some other some other sectors as well. There are certain sectors that really stand out to you here.

We're all central banks are tightening in a synchronized manner but in an uncoordinated matter. And this combine tightening of monetary policy around the world We'll have consequences that I'm not sure everyone is capturing at this point. And so when you look at obviously what the feathers looking at is is backwards looking when you look at some of the CPI data and there was concern that perhaps you should sort of wait and sort of see how these things are impacting the real economy before continuing to be so aggressive what's your take on that I think all Central Banks and all policy makers right now are convinced that they need to regain control over inflation. They were all a bit late to the game in terms of tightening monetary policy in the face of what has become persistently elevated inflation and they want to regain control over the inflation and the inflation narrative. And in doing so, they will want to tighten monetary Aggressively continue doing so even if that entails some pain in the form of higher unemployment rate and has power set it below potential trend growth that means essentially that the fed another central banks are looking for a significant cooling of demand a significant tightening of financial conditions and they won't back down at Signs of an economic slowdown. If anything, that slowdown is what they want to see to hope for lower inflation. So, I think the bar next year for rate cuts is actually quite high on the Fed front and for other central banks including in Europe.

And and sticking with the consumer in terms of where we are with supply and demand. Are we seeing any sort of leveling off at this point? Any sort of parity coming in now? We are in some sectors. We are starting to see this delicate rebalancing act taken place and as you correctly note one of the big issues right now is that there are number of sectors that are still in balanced.

The advantage of 125 basis points would have been Way ahead of the market Ahead of the curve I'm dead after they will not have to do very much. This way around they increase it by 75 the market is expecting under the 75 in November And the market will keep expecting that for a few more meetings They are going to increase even more than they would have had they given a one big move in last month Actually with that said you know we're just talking about the comments that we got from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans today about the concerns that many others have raised about moving too aggressively in too soon Obviously you weren't anticipating the 125 basis points.

Think about 2008 when Lehman brothers went down Policy shifted to ESA. And that is one of my scenarios as a possibility for the future Scenario would be that the very strong dollar Because the strong dollar reads to typically leads to financing issues and if that happens and if you have a coordinated Of supporting the dollar like we did with the plaza accord in 1985 that will be a turn around in policy as well so you need accidents to change it your knock it's not going to happen With the normal course of time Finally Shri while we're talking about the fed right now obviously we're in a global higher rate environment a lot of focus being placed on the bank of England given what has played out over the last few days the huge swing that we've seen in the pound also on the back of these tax cuts that have been propos By this new administration.

I mean, is that sort of how investors should be looking at these utility names as we go into the winter months and look at these major price likes. No i don't think so at all all of those companies profit on higher commodity prices utilities really only have their fortunes based on solid regulation and the investments that they have in their company so if the price of natural gas goes It really is a pass through from from the utility to the customer. So, it's an unfortunate situation for the customers. It also, you know, no utility likes to see bills go up. A because they don't have any benefit from it but be You know it it really it's just not good for the relationship with their customer and their and their regulator so you know again I don't I don't think you have to to worry about You know weather or not the commodity is going to to affect the the profits of these companies new certainly shouldn't be investing in utilities to say go long natural gas or or something like that These are conservative investments The you know, plenty of stocks that yield out, you know, well, over three%, have their, they're earnings growth, you know, inaccessive five% so they really the opportunity ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbqt2Pa1J9E,39,2022-09-27 16:37:16

I think the there's some regulatory agencies that View against that. So, you'd be interesting to see which view plans out. Building on that back to that op ed in terms of regulations you write that advanced regulations for crypto goes against the ethos but it that it would foster innovation and establish trust so my question is if the US were to come out with clear rules or regulating Would that really help riptoe blossom when we see more money funneled into the sector advancing faster adoption both on the part of corporations and consumers and ultimately does that lift us out of the crypto winter?

So, to be honest, it's very hard to tell. There's a few different prints, well, that's a few different logics here. Why is when there's high interest rate, people should want a hard cash or deposit back in your banks But the banking interest rate is nothing comparable to crippler right now with stating your general generating products And even like D five D five give you very good returns much higher than the bank and the money doesn't leave the D five protocol so the other aspect is the quick place still very much a correlated with a stock market which is actually counter intuitive But I guess today most of the crypto traders are also stock traders So when the stock market tanks and they wanna hold cash and then actually cry to market goes with it in theory they should be inversely correlated but we have not seen that quite just just yet I think it will take a couple of years to To see that.

The higher prices or they don't wanna wait cuz that's a new thing too. And that is not happening either. I think that this is probably not the system that is exactly ideal so we probably are just gonna have to Where it's not as if you're gonna lose customers cuz that really is the danger Auto companies as well as dealers as they're just gonna walk because someone else can offer them a car in 3 weeks and maybe at MSRP versus waiting 2 months and you know a few $1000 over on SRP Just got how much of this is because of that when we talk about the increase in cost here how much of it is because of the Consumer. Yeah i mean there's probably a few dynamics going and one is consumer driven over the years people especially in this country we've wanted larger vehicles we want more options as a result a lot of companies especially Detroit companies they shuttered their smaller car lines so that is a naturally driven the price of vehicles up and then we hit this supply short Propelled ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpMzGq1hnpU,45,2022-09-28 16:59:43

We can't have mortgages, you know, as as mentioned earlier up above But moving 20 basis points each day in order to have the risk of your assets classes stabilize so that's number one secondarily we need to have more certainty with respect to the bed path of future tightening and typically we see you know pretty volatile Moves in equity markets in the last couple of months leading into the fed sort of peak in the hiking cycle we're not there yet and so until we see you know more certainty with regards to a stabilization of the path of the bed hiking cycle we can't expect to see stability within equity ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iZhU71SmU,34,2022-09-29 16:13:06

What you're seeing from the consumer is a managing down in terms of their cost and so they're doing so by looking at cheaper options whether it's for food, eating more at home, At stores with bigger discounts that are you know best in class in terms of price like some of the big box retailers and and looking at you know how they they can save in terms of their discretionary spend. So I think that stocks that will do well in this environments or ones that are you know typically the trade down socks. At home stocks the big box retailers and the names that you know tend to do well in sort of risk off environments because people are really managing their cost lower and you know looking to see where they can so names that are highly discretionary like travel and leisure I think we're gonna get hit home builders I think Retailers will probably get hit as well but you know the ones that are really focused on providing essentials are the names that I think can outperform.

Yeah that's good to face this question On. The truth is that it is rich countries that have created the climate crisis. There's no doubt about that. In terms of what we need to do I'm afraid we have to do both. We have to mitigate future climate By chain decarbonizing changing taking the carbon out of energy systems in the rich world we also have to mitigate future danger by helping the poorest countries develop in a way that doesn't repeat our mistakes but we also have to adapt I'm afraid it's too late now to have a choice between ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iZhU71SmU,41,2022-09-29 16:43:20

If you have an insurance company that number one runs into Paying claims are number two is declared in solvent because of the mass losses from hurricane Ian you are protected by either the border hurricane catastrophe fund or the Florida insurance guarantee association so your claims will be paid you do not need to worry about that So what are some of the solutions then to obviously these underlying problems that already preexisted this current wave of hurricanes and storms? What we need our legislative actions that are strong enough to stop the mass flow of lawsuits until there is a legislative package in place to disincentivize these types of frivolous lawsuits being filed literally sometimes by the thousands by single Law firms.

The revenue there was $one. 66 billion down 16% you're over year But that is down a little bit west than it was last quarter so it seems like maybe a little bit of improvement in that area and then I do wanna read a quote for you guys here from president and CEO of Nike John Donahue he said that our strong start to full year 2023 highlights the depth and breath of Nike's global portfolio as we continue to manage through volatility our Pipeline of innovative product continue to prove that our strategy is working but again here guys you got Nike shares down about two% seems like maybe that greater China area might be weighing on them again and also those inventories up 44 year% over year. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iZhU71SmU,92,2022-09-29 20:26:49

Many view David Nike is a real bell weather for the economy and for the sector what is it tell you about what's coming I think right now there's people are far more pessimistic than they really should be because I mean we're seeing a lot of companies that are definitely suffering in the second half of the year but they're Alex you know maybe down for the next couple of quarters but generally demand for their products remains high we're seeing a lot of company especially international Like Nike that have large businesses in Europe that are being affected their stock prices are down quite a bit because people anticipate a major recession in Europe due to the war in the financial situation and then also in North America people are anticipating a recession but if you look at the numbers for the most part the the companies that I cover not reporting the kind of numbers that suggest Gonna be a major recession. David when we take a look at the strong dollar obviously a huge headwind here for Nike I guess how big of a challenge do you see that being for the company in the current quarter It's gonna be a problem. I mean, there's nothing Nike can do about it. But you know, I think I've seen other companies that have had more problems with it. So I think Nike seems to be handling a pretty well. I mean, the company still reported four% sales growth in the quarter and it would have been 10% constant currency. It looks like so, you know, it's Generate sales growth even with a significant headwind from the strong dollar. Many other companies right now have been reporting negative sales growth because of the dollar. So, it does seem like Nike is is getting through that situation better than most others.

They're not going to be able to do that You gotta start with the unit economics. First, they have to produce a product that actually generates a profit and they're not doing that. So, whether or not they sell that over their website, Amazon's website, or in Dick's Sporting Good Stores, sort of doesn't matter how much you sell a product that Actually generate a profit.

Yeah I know they're absolutely gonna need more cash I mean they're burning at an alarming clip and look the bottom one on content is that it's it's expensive to produce I mean just look at the troubles that Netflix has had right people don't realize that Netflix is a terribly cash flow negative business because they capitalize all those content costs yeah content is not cheap go to original Content is expensive.

Other parts of the state, those big numbers will start coming down today. Because, you know, I've even had paradigms up here in Gainesville.

Well, Sure i think we'll get it. Below the point which we change behavior and we're continue to grow and build in areas that are vulnerable to these extreme events and it's not that we can't have development but we really need to think more about how we're building, not looking at the past, turns like 100 year events, a 1000 year events, really our capturing what's happening.

Certainly good afternoon. Thank you for having me on. So, when we look at what's been happening fundamentally with them, you know, the booking curve still looks pretty healthy.

And there are times they'll have both and some of that quite frankly is not their fault. So certainly a hurricane forming some place and hating a region and creating travel disruption On a particular company Certainly the labor thing is is a delicate balance so Probably Meet him to long term this means ex fuel seat mount cost are going to be higher And at the same time, you know, there's probably going to be less capacity.

Do you wanna just go through them and sort a lay person's term which I know is your specialty Sure so Emma Rene we are familiar with that with that approach that vaccine approach because that created the maternity as well as the Fizer vaccines For Messenger RNA which is just a molecule we have inside of us. It transports instructions from the DNA to the part of the cell where proteins are created that we live on. Depend on every day. And it was always this sort of dream of scientist to to create in the lab. Well, if it's so important in the body, maybe we could create a synthetic version just like there's, you know, sugar, natural Synthetic version of sugar. So, the idea was, well, if we could create marinate in the lab, we could tell our bodies to create any protein and that was the idea. In this case Create a protein, the protein in this case. Like any other vaccine it's an education for the body and the other approach I write about the identical virus approach that led to the J and J as well as the AstraZeneca vaccines tats are really interesting one two that one also took years in making and I read about how the how that began really with HIV effort to to salvage we haven't Figure that one out yet but they shifted these scientists and said, okay, we can't do HIV but we're gonna get a vaccine for COVID.

I mean this seems like it's not gonna just end as you suggest Yeah. Right. And these vaccines are so much more effective than the flu vaccine. So, if you've got protection of 7080, percent, and is even higher for hospitalization and and death, it it will allow us to return to some to a normal say really. It's anxiety. You hear that other countries vaccines are not as effective Like the Chinese vaccine. I don't know where the Russian vaccine stands. There was one, I heard there was one in Cuba that was not Not affected at all. Like why is that Well, they use different approaches. So, I write the book a little bit on the Russian approach is a variation on the one that you mentioned with Dan Bruke and the J and J one.

Do you think the same? Yeah, I think there is upside to oil right now. What is remarkable that we're talking about opac curtailing production at a time where the inventories globally are at the lower end of the historical range and you're looking at it in the market which is highly back related which is a state where the prompt prices Bob deferred prices which is typical when a market is tight and there's and consumers are willing to pay a premium for immediate delivery. If you look at the carry in the oil market succeeding 15% which is on the operator of historical range to think that Opec is taking this as a time to cut is really without historical president and if they do so, they're gonna To keep the inventories low. Which will keep upward prices. There are likely doing this to one preempt any potential demand slowdown. But also in my mind they're doing it to reflect the fact That their spare capacity is towards the bottom of historical range. It's sort of like driving a car with your foot pressed down all the way to the metal and you're starting to get feedback and vibrations in this system and I think as a result, they wanna move off of their production that they're at right now.

I guess how effective are they typically or do you think they would potentially be? So it's being sold right now when you're talking about oil specifically As an attempt to get around European sanctions do you agree to a price cap we'll wave some of these sanctions on an unshipping and insurance and hopefully that will grease the wheels but that is not ultimately how the market should function and I think the price cap could likely backfire in part because Russia holds a say and how much they're willing to sell and to who and at what price? And Nate and we've seen small reductions and export volumes could have outside impact and prices particularly when the market is tight. Now, in Europe, the problem is it sends the wrong incentives to the consumers. Particularly if there's some That aren't capped they will have a higher burden just to bear if the market is tight so for example if you're gonna cap residential commercial industrial end users will have ultimately higher prices to manage through the the demand rational that needs to happen Surprise caps are really not the ultimate solution Than they're hoping for.

So, you're still gonna always have that that SUV flexibility be one of the focuses of consumer demand and that's why so many car companies have switched Generally toward SUVs versus cars but it also means that if you're able to buy without getting an SUV if you can get by with the Sudan You get a much better price versus an SUV which everyone wants.

So again, that's the that's kind of the like profile. The next 6 months gonna be very clear Clearer not very clear you know we've been talking a lot about jobs I'm curious to ask you about housing yeah because we talk about housing a lot and how much mortgage rates have gone up and how it's there it's a problem of affordability but when you talk about it as an Driver how concerned are you about housing? Well, that is an interest rate sensitive sector so when the fed tightens or any central bank titans, it's not uniform across the economy. You're gonna look at the interest rate sensitive sectors and they should be feeling the pain first. That's housing durable goods etcetera. So, the housing starts we have a couple of funny prints recently but that should be Going down, housing demand should be slowing down as the prices should be leveling off but again, you're looking for an narrative that's gonna deceleration rather than tanking but do you know the mortgage rates are pushing seven% right now, right? Not too long ago, they were three and some of us luckily locked in lower than that but that's that's a big affordability issue. So, that should be, you know, breaking the economy But again, if people have jobs, they think they're gonna keep their jobs. They're gonna continue to spend. The moderate they're spending for, you know, lower acid prices or you know, bit higher inflation but that's the sector. One of the sectors that's on the short list. Yeah. If we start to see that really go pear shape, then Might be in the recession scenario rather than the slowdown scenario. So, we have housing prices coming into wraps. We have consumers worried about even rising interest rates and we have the market's terrible year for the markets. Many parts of it. How does this impact consumer spending into 2023?

If that's not coming down meaningfully after Sort of nice scenario we're talking about and then we get your down like Julie but I think that's not a baseline right now. Oh nope. Another contributor to that the inflationary pressures that we have seen has been energy costs as well and even as we think about what a US recession may look like, there's also what we were discussing earlier in the show in And some of the cutting and some of their production. What that may mean in Europe but also how much the European or a global recession more broadly may also trickle into the US economy. Yeah, I mean, energy, oil prices are in the 80s right On Opec's gonna talking that looks like strategically they might wanna kinda keep them in that zone but energy prices are down quite a bit right so going around town there were five handles on gas not too long ago an hour in the three so that That's source of inflation has come down the supply chain source of inflation has come down food still a bit elevated but if we put all that in sort of a non-core bucket that part of the inflation is pulling down the headline numbers but the We just talked about 2 minutes ago which is the core is still going up. So, that's gonna help. If that helps drag down the other stuff, that's good but you know, we still have a core inflation problem in this country and a lot of other countries and that's what Central Banks have to look at Other stuff is great for the headline but they're really focused on the the core.

To think that Opec is taking this is a time To cut is really without historical president and if they do so they're gonna continue to keep the inventories low which will keep upward prices they're largely doing this to one preempt any potential demand slow down but also in my mind they're doing it to reflect the fact That their spare capacity is towards the bottom of historical range. It's sort of like driving a car with your foot pressed down all the way to the metal and you're starting to get feedback and vibrations in this system.

I guess how effective are they typically or do you think they would potentially be? So it's being sold right now when you're talking about oil specifically. As an attempt to get around European sanctions do you agree to a price cap we'll wave some of these sanctions on shipping and insurance and hopefully that will grease the wheels but that is not ultimately how the market should function and I think the price cap could likely backfire in part because Russia holds to say and how much they're willing to sell and to who and at what price? And Nate and we've seen small reductions in export volumes could have outside Particularly when the market is tight. Now, in Europe, Album is it sends the wrong incentives to the consumers Particularly if there's some That aren't capped. They will have a higher burden to to bear if the market is tight. So, for example, if you're gonna cap residential, commercial, industrial end users, we'll have ultimately higher prices to manage through The demand ration that needs to happen so price caps are really not the ultimate solution That's gonna rebalance the market and unfortunately it could lead to more volatility and then they're hoping for it.

The same time that allows them to be more efficient and They will look at employment base during any recession. Now, having said that, what I what I think is fascinating is that as business leaders, you know, we live through an early recession in the pandemic and we saw a quick rebound in the economy and some of us learned lessons from maybe having some employees leave the organization that we regret leaving and then, we faced into the great resign Shortly thereafter. So, I think CEOs are recognized that people are their greatest asset and they're going to be I think generally cautious about any kind of workforce reductions.

Anybody who wants to be in this business is gonna have to make a splash. So, the answer to your question is Yes consolidation is likely if a big tech company decides they wanna be in this I don't think Netflix has the assets or the appetite to go spend you know 6070 one 1 billion dollars Amazon maybe but they you know they're they're pissing money down a whole trying to build games themselves and they're doing a really Job at it.

Well, in Alexis, you pointed out the fact that you know, we can sort of clean some ideas from these texts that have come out in this back and forth fight between the two sides. What is that suggest in terms of the next movie on Mos Wants to make when the deal closes. Yeah, so we got to see actually a lot of what Elon must thinks about what the future of Twitter should be in those texts that came out in this litigation and for one, he said that he would like to unwind those permanent bands that one that impacted Trump and others. Also, there were some discussion with his brother, Kimball Musk saying that there was this blockchain idea that there would be a paid a tweet so that it would be recorded much later than goes back, walks out back and say, no, that's not gonna really be possible because of And see issues that the platform has to chug along much quicker than that from a programming standpoint also for those concerned that to Dan's point that there would be not enough speech moderation musk on April 28 said this to an investor Michael Kive's he said Twitter is obviously not going to be turned into some right wing nut house aiming to be Oddly inclusive as possible.

That's gonna put a little bit of a crimp in the people who are looking for a fed plaza or a fed pivot. It gives us likely to drive inflation at least stabilize inflation to higher level There is another catalyst looming in December when you've got those sanctions on Russian oil taking effect obviously these headlines coming out of G seven countries saying they maybe they wanna try and phase that in to to try in limits Impact to the markets overall but how much of that has actually already been priced in, you think? Well, I think a decent amount of it again. I was short crude oil prior to the leaks of opac potentially cutting by a one 1 million. My prediction was there were going to cut by a one 1 million a half and be able to sort of go out of the public and say we're actually trying to help our allies as best we can by not cutting two 1 million barrels. It didn't do that. They went ahead with My own barrel. So, from a perspective of what's going on with the future output of production. They've already been missing their current production quota. So, there's two 1 million barrel cuts really only gonna be about 800 1000 to a one 1 million if they actually were to reach maximum here So, the length of it is disturbing to me. The length of time that they're going to do this because this means that it can do and they're they've announced they're gonna have meetings every other month now. Which prior to that, they said that they would be at a need to know basis. Every other month means they can adjust as both up or down and it seems like they're target is more to Production now.

Production certainly key when you consider how depleted SPR already is. You know, there's a political backdrop to all this which is of course that trip the president made to Saudi Arabia over the summer. You know, we saw in the bath aftermath of that Opec Plus just increasing production just slightly but now you've got this What is considered you know more than expected two 1 million barrels a day production cut what does that mean in terms of the US relationship with the Saudi's well it's obviously iceier than it used to be and let's let's not forget that this goes back to the murder of the journalist Kamal Kashoji Jamalka Shoji a few years ago Turkey a perpetrated by the Saudi regime so Biden described the Saudi government and their leader Muhammad Bidzelman as a state in when he was running for That obviously reflected deteriorating relations and then he had to go over there kind of kind of taking it back and saying could you please release a little more oil they basically Said no. So, you know, there's a there's a lot this market is huge and very dynamic and you're one of the things that has gotten the Saudi's attention is increased production in the United States. The United States is still the world's largest producer of oil. It became the first largest producer a couple of years ago and it still is. But the government here doesn't control the oil sector. That's a big difference. So, the government here can't say pump more, pump less. That's up to the private sector and all the incentives there. So, very dynamic market.

Well I think there's a number of things starting with Opec Plus concerned about the world going into a recession which impart was caused by high energy prices earlier this year when we saw crude oil places rallied in between 130 and $140 a barrel as well as the high natural Industrial output so I think they wanted to take a preemptive step to reduce production in light of declining demand Higher inflation rates eating into their budgets.

That car is worth the fortune. How do you manage expectations in this sort of environment? Whether it's from what sellers can expect to get or even the fees that sellers and buyers can expect to pay. Yo, we really just lean on that transparency and that's what's really different. The internet was a scary place for people for a long time to try to sell a car.

2676,"They have all the money they need in terms of deposits. The banks that do compete aggressively are the smaller institutions. So, it's not the one that has a branch on every corner, not the one that has its name on the stadium, but smaller institutions, we see rates as high as 301%. Now Institutions like dollar savings direct UFB direct these are completely federally insured so I say move your money over to these and get that risk free return No a lot of people obviously more comes through with some of these bigger bags that they recognize but as you mentioned, they're not seeing the returns. How important is it to shop around at the moment? It's really important because there is an arms race going on at the high end of the savings market. By the way, I think these rates are even more attractive than CDs because they're liquid. You could get three. Six% on a 1 year CD but you could get 301. On a totally liquid, federally insured, Savings account and these rates could continue to go higher too because banks do compete but you're not gonna get anything pretty much by just sitting in the big bank. The average there is 014. So, what you wanna do is shop around, look for federal insurance, and look to tie this to your checking account. I think that's a good You may keep the big bank checking account for ATM access and other things. Link it to a savings account. Park your emergency savings there. You could get at least a few $100 a year. You know, if you save $10 thousand over the course of the year at three%, that's 300 bucks.

2677,"Is how long does that last? Does that come with higher debt loads, higher delinquencies, so far so good, but some of these are lagging indicators. So, it it bears a close watch. And I also wanna ask you about some of these credit card balances and loans and things that people are starting to take out as they now are dipping more into their savings than ever as inflation starts to bite. What should people be aware of? And what are you tracking when it comes to things like credit content? The average credit card rate is about 18 and a half percent now that's the highest in 30 years balances have been going up as well According to the New York Fed as of Q two they were four percentage points below that all time high which was set in late 2019 but they did take up 13% from Qtwo of last year to queue to of this year we're gonna get the queue three data soon I think that could well show a record but this is another one of those kind Counterintuitive things that despite the highest rates in 30 years despite what could soon be an all-time record for credit card balances delinquencies remain very low the debt to income ratio remains very low The industry is thinking about this in terms of normalization. You know, yeah, these delinquencies are gonna go up but so far the the thinking is that it won't be in a worry some sense. It'll be maybe back to 2019 levels. The strong job market definitely helps. Something resilient at least for now a big thank you to Bangrate senior industry analyst Ted Rossman have a great afternoon.
